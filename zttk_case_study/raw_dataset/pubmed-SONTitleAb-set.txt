TI  - Dbp5/DDX19 between Translational Readthrough and Nonsense Mediated Decay.
LID - 10.3390/ijms21031085 [doi]
LID - 1085
AB  - The DEAD-box protein Dbp5 (human DDX19) remodels RNA-protein complexes. Dbp5 
      functions in ribonucleoprotein export and translation termination. Termination 
      occurs, when the ribosome has reached a stop codon through the Dbp5 mediated 
      delivery of the eukaryotic termination factor eRF1. eRF1 contacts eRF3 upon 
      dissociation of Dbp5, resulting in polypeptide chain release and subsequent 
      ribosomal subunit splitting. Mutations in DBP5 lead to stop codon readthrough, 
      because the eRF1 and eRF3 interaction is not controlled and occurs prematurely. This 
      identifies Dbp5/DDX19 as a possible potent drug target for nonsense suppression 
      therapy. Neurodegenerative diseases and cancer are caused in many cases by the loss 
      of a gene product, because its mRNA contained a premature termination codon (PTC) 
      and is thus eliminated through the nonsense mediated decay (NMD) pathway, which is 
      described in the second half of this review. We discuss translation termination and 
      NMD in the light of Dbp5/DDX19 and subsequently speculate on reducing Dbp5/DDX19 
      activity to allow readthrough of the PTC and production of a full-length protein to 
      detract the RNA from NMD as a possible treatment for diseases.

TI  - SON and SRRM2 are essential for nuclear speckle formation.
LID - 10.7554/eLife.60579 [doi]
LID - e60579
AB  - Nuclear speckles (NS) are among the most prominent biomolecular condensates. Despite 
      their prevalence, research on the function of NS is virtually restricted to 
      colocalization analyses, since an organizing core, without which NS cannot form, 
      remains unidentified. The monoclonal antibody SC35, raised against a spliceosomal 
      extract, is frequently used to mark NS. Unexpectedly, we found that this antibody 
      was mischaracterized and the main target of SC35 mAb is SRRM2, a 
      spliceosome-associated protein that sharply localizes to NS. Here we show that, the 
      core of NS is likely formed by SON and SRRM2, since depletion of SON leads only to a 
      partial disassembly of NS, while co-depletion of SON and SRRM2 or depletion of SON 
      in a cell-line where intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) of SRRM2 are 
      genetically deleted, leads to a near-complete dissolution of NS. This work, 
      therefore, paves the way to study the role of NS under diverse physiological and 
      stress conditions.

OAB - Most cells store their genetic material inside a compartment called the nucleus, 
      which helps to separate DNA from other molecules in the cell. Inside the nucleus, 
      DNA is tightly packed together with proteins that can read the cell’s genetic code 
      and convert into the RNA molecules needed to build proteins. However, the contents 
      of the nucleus are not randomly arranged, and these proteins are often clustered 
      into specialized areas where they perform their designated roles. One of the first 
      nuclear territories to be identified were granular looking structures named Nuclear 
      Speckles (or NS for short), which are thought to help process RNA before it leaves 
      the nucleus. Structures like NS often contain a number of different factors held 
      together by a core group of proteins known as a scaffold. Although NS were 
      discovered over a century ago, little is known about their scaffold proteins, making 
      it difficult to understand the precise role of these speckles. Typically, 
      researchers visualize NS using a substance called SC35 which targets specific sites 
      in these structures. However, it was unclear which parts of the NS this marker binds 
      to. To answer this question, Ilik et al. studied NS in human cells grown in the lab. 
      The analysis revealed that SC35 attaches to certain parts of a large, flexible 
      protein called SRRM2. Ilik et al. discovered that although the structure and 
      sequence of SRMM2 varies between different animal species, a small region of this 
      protein remained unchanged throughout evolution. Studying the evolutionary history 
      of SRRM2 led to the identification of another protein with similar properties called 
      SON. Ilik et al. found that depleting SON and SRRM2 from human cells caused other 
      proteins associated with the NS to diffuse away from their territories and become 
      dispersed within the nucleus. This suggests that SRMM2 and SON make up the scaffold 
      that holds the proteins in NS together. Nuclear speckles have been associated with 
      certain viral infections, and seem to help prevent the onset of diseases such as 
      Huntington’s and spinocerebellar ataxia. These newly discovered core proteins could 
      therefore further our understanding of the role NS play in disease.

AB  - Telomere length control is critical for cellular lifespan and tumor suppression. 
      Telomerase is transiently activated in the inner cell mass of the developing 
      blastocyst to reset telomere reserves. Its silencing upon differentiation leads to 
      gradual telomere shortening in somatic cells. Here, we report that transcriptional 
      regulation through cis-regulatory elements only partially accounts for telomerase 
      activation in pluripotent cells. Instead, developmental control of telomerase is 
      primarily driven by an alternative splicing event, centered around hTERT exon 2. 
      Skipping of exon 2 triggers hTERT mRNA decay in differentiated cells, and 
      conversely, its retention promotes telomerase accumulation in pluripotent cells. We 
      identify SON as a regulator of exon 2 alternative splicing and report a patient 
      carrying a SON mutation and suffering from insufficient telomerase and short 
      telomeres. In summary, our study highlights a critical role for hTERT alternative 
      splicing in the developmental regulation of telomerase and implicates defective 
      splicing in telomere biology disorders.

TI  - Emerging molecular functions and novel roles for the DEAD-box protein Dbp5/DDX19 in 
      gene expression.

AB  - The DEAD-box protein (DBP) Dbp5, a member of the superfamily II (SFII) helicases, 
      has multiple reported roles in gene expression. First identified as an essential 
      regulator of mRNA export in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the enzyme now has reported 
      functions in non-coding RNA export, translation, transcription, and DNA metabolism. 
      Localization of the protein to various cellular compartments (nucleoplasm, nuclear 
      envelope, and cytoplasm) highlights the ability of Dbp5 to modulate different stages 
      of the RNA lifecycle. While Dbp5 has been well studied for > 20 years, several 
      critical questions remain regarding the mechanistic principles that govern Dbp5 
      localization, substrate selection, and functions in gene expression. This review 
      aims to take a holistic view of the proposed functions of Dbp5 and evaluate models 
      that accommodate current published data.

AB  - The DEAD-box RNA helicase Dbp5 is an essential and conserved mRNA export factor 
      which functions in the ATP dependent remodeling of RNA/protein complexes. As such it 
      displaces mRNA bound proteins at the cytoplasmic site of the nuclear pore complex. 
      For the regulation of its RNA-dependent ATPase activity during late steps of nuclear 
      transport, Dbp5 requires the nucleoporin Nup159 and its cofactors Gle1 and IP6. In 
      addition to its role in mRNA export, a second important function of Dbp5 was 
      identified in translation termination, where it acts together with eRF1 once the 
      translation machinery has reached the stop codon. Similar to mRNA export, this 
      function also requires Gle1-IP6, however, the counterpart of Nup159 is still 
      missing. Potential other functions of the nucleo-cytoplasmic protein Dbp5 are 
      discussed as well as its substrate specificity and details in its regulatory cycle 
      that are based on recent biochemical and structural characterization. This article 
      is part of a Special Issue entitled: The Biology of RNA helicases - Modulation for 
      life.

AB  - Gene expression is a stepwise process involving distinct cellular processes 
      including transcription, mRNA (mRNA) processing, mRNA export, and translation. As 
      mRNAs are being synthesized, proteins associate with the RNA to form messenger 
      ribonucleoprotein particles (mRNPs). Previous studies have demonstrated that the 
      RNA-binding protein composition of these mRNPs is dynamic, changing as the mRNP 
      moves through the different steps of gene expression, and playing a critical role in 
      these events. An important step during this maturation process occurs at the 
      cytoplasmic face of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) where the export protein Gle1 
      bound to inositol hexakisphosphate (IP 6) spatially activates the ATP-hydrolysis and 
      mRNP-remodeling activity of the DEAD-box protein Dbp5. Recent work from our 
      laboratory and others has provided important insights into the function and 
      regulation of Dbp5. These include a more detailed explanation of the mechanism of 
      Dbp5 RNP remodeling, the role of Gle1-IP6 in stimulating Dbp5 ATPase activity, and 
      the identification of a novel paradigm for regulation of Dbp5 by Nup159. Based on in 
      vitro biochemical assays, X-ray crystallography, and corresponding in vivo 
      phenotypes, we propose here an updated model of the Dbp5 cycle during mRNP export 
      through the NPC. This takes into account all available data and provides a platform 
      for future studies.

AB  - The overall understanding of the molecular etiologies of intellectual disability 
      (ID) and developmental delay (DD) is increasing as next-generation sequencing 
      technologies identify genetic variants in individuals with such disorders. However, 
      detailed analyses conclusively confirming these variants, as well as the underlying 
      molecular mechanisms explaining the diseases, are often lacking. Here, we report on 
      an ID syndrome caused by de novo heterozygous loss-of-function (LoF) mutations in 
      SON. The syndrome is characterized by ID and/or DD, malformations of the cerebral 
      cortex, epilepsy, vision problems, musculoskeletal abnormalities, and congenital 
      malformations. Knockdown of son in zebrafish resulted in severe malformation of the 
      spine, brain, and eyes. Importantly, analyses of RNA from affected individuals 
      revealed that genes critical for neuronal migration and cortex organization (TUBG1, 
      FLNA, PNKP, WDR62, PSMD3, and HDAC6) and metabolism (PCK2, PFKL, IDH2, ACY1, and 
      ADA) are significantly downregulated because of the accumulation of mis-spliced 
      transcripts resulting from erroneous SON-mediated RNA splicing. Our data highlight 
      SON as a master regulator governing neurodevelopment and demonstrate the importance 
      of SON-mediated RNA splicing in human development.

TI  - Dbp5 associates with RNA-bound Mex67 and Nab2 and its localization at the nuclear

AB  - In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the mRNA export receptor Mex67 is recruited to mature 
      nuclear transcripts to mediate mRNA export through the nuclear pore complex (NPC) to 
      the cytoplasm. Mex67 binds transcripts through adaptor proteins such as the poly(A) 
      binding protein Nab2. When a transcript reaches the cytoplasmic face of the NPC, the 
      DEAD-box protein Dbp5 acts to induce a local structural change to release Nab2 and 
      Mex67 in an essential process termed mRNP remodeling. It is unknown how certain 
      proteins (Nab2, Mex67) are released during Dbp5-mediated mRNP remodeling, whereas 
      others remain associated. Here, we demonstrate that Dbp5 associates in close 
      proximity with Mex67 and Nab2 in a cellular complex. Further, fusion of Dbp5 to 
      Nup159 anchors Dbp5 at the cytoplasmic face of the NPC and is sufficient for cell 
      viability. Thus, we speculate that the essential role of Dbp5 in remodeling 
      exporting mRNPs requires its localization to the NPC and is separable from other 
      subcellular functions of Dbp5. This work supports a model where the diverse nuclear, 
      cytoplasmic and NPC functions of Dbp5 in the mRNA lifecycle are not interdependent 
      and that Dbp5 is locally recruited through complex protein-protein interactions to 
      select regions of transcripts for specific removal of transport proteins at the NPC.

AB  - Dbp5, DDX19 in humans, is an essential DEAD-box protein involved in mRNA export, 
      which has also been linked to other cellular processes, including rRNA export and 
      translation. Dbp5 ATPase activity is regulated by several factors, including RNA, 
      the nucleoporin proteins Nup159 and Gle1, and the endogenous small-molecule inositol 
      hexakisphosphate (InsP(6)). To better understand how these factors modulate Dbp5 
      activity and how this modulation relates to in vivo RNA metabolism, a detailed 
      characterization of the Dbp5 mechanochemical cycle in the presence of those 
      regulators individually or together is necessary. In this study, we test the 
      hypothesis that Nup159 controls the ADP-bound state of Dbp5. In addition, the 
      contributions of Mg(2+) to the kinetics and thermodynamics of ADP binding to Dbp5 
      were assessed. Using a solution based in vitro approach, Mg(2+) was found to slow 
      ADP and ATP release from Dbp5 and increased the overall ADP and ATP affinities, as 
      observed with other NTPases. Furthermore, Nup159 did not accelerate ADP release, 
      while Gle1 actually slowed ADP release independent of Mg(2+). These findings are not 
      consistent with Nup159 acting as a nucleotide exchange factor to promote ADP release 
      and Dbp5 ATPase cycling. Instead, in the presence of Nup159, the interaction between 
      Gle1 and ADP-bound Dbp5 was found to be reduced by ~18-fold, suggesting that Nup159 
      alters the Dbp5-Gle1 interaction to aid Gle1 release from Dbp5.

TI  - Nuclear RNA export and its importance in abiotic stress responses of plants.
PG  - 235-55
AB  - Transduction of developmental and environmental cues into the nucleus to induce 
      transcription and the export of RNAs to the cytoplasm through the nuclear pore 
      complex (NPC) play pivotal roles in regulation of gene expression. The process of 
      bulk export of mRNAs from nucleus to cytoplasm is highly conserved across 
      eukaryotes. Assembly of export-competent mRNA ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) is coupled 
      with both transcription and mRNA processing. The export-competent mRNP consists of 
      mRNAs and a dozen nucleocytoplasmic shuttling nuclear proteins, including RNA export 
      factors (Mex67-Mtr2 heterodimer, Npl3), poly(A)-binding proteins, DEAD-box protein 5 
      (Dbp5), and nucleoporins (NUPs) in yeast. Mobile NUPs help docking of mRNP to the 
      NPC nuclear basket. A partially unfolded mRNP complex appears to be pulled through 
      the NPC by using energy from Dbp5-catalyzed ATP hydrolysis. Dbp5 probably catalyzes 
      the release of mRNA from mRNP in the cytoplasm. In contrast to bulk export of mRNAs 
      by a Mex67-Mtr2/Npl3-dependent pathway, a specific subset of mRNA export under 
      stress and export of microRNAs are mediated through the karyopherin (importin beta) 
      family of proteins in a Ran-GTPase-dependent pathway. Our knowledge of mRNA export 
      mechanisms in flowering plants is in its infancy. Some proteins of the NUP107-160 
      complex, NUPs and DEAD-box proteins (DBPs), have been studied in flowering plants. 
      Arabidopsis NUP160/SAR1 plays a critical role in mRNA export, regulation of 
      flowering, and hormone and abiotic stress responses, whereas NUP96/ SAR3/MOS3 is 
      required for mRNA export to modulate hormonal and biotic stress responses. DEAD-box 
      proteins have been implicated in mRNA export and abiotic stress response of yeast 
      and higher plants. Arabidopsis DBP CRYOPHYTE/LOS4 plays an important role in mRNA 
      export, abiotic stress response, germination, and plant development. Further studies 
      on various components of nuclear mRNA export in plants during nonstress and stress 
      conditions will be necessary to understand the link between mRNA export and 
      stress-responsive gene expression.

TI  - Mechanisms of nuclear mRNA export: A structural perspective.
PG  - 829-840
LID - 10.1111/tra.12691 [doi]
AB  - Export of mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm is a critical process for all 
      eukaryotic gene expression. As mRNA is synthesized, it is packaged with a myriad of 
      RNA-binding proteins to form ribonucleoprotein particles (mRNPs). For each step in 
      the processes of maturation and export, mRNPs must have the correct complement of 
      proteins. Much of the mRNA export pathway revolves around the heterodimeric export 
      receptor yeast Mex67•Mtr2/human NXF1•NXT1, which is recruited to signal the 
      completion of nuclear mRNP assembly, mediates mRNP targeting/translocation through 
      the nuclear pore complex (NPC), and is displaced at the cytoplasmic side of the NPC 
      to release the mRNP into the cytoplasm. Directionality of the transport is governed 
      by at least two DEAD-box ATPases, yeast Sub2/human UAP56 in the nucleus and yeast 
      Dbp5/human DDX19 at the cytoplasmic side of the NPC, which respectively mediate the 
      association and dissociation of Mex67•Mtr2/NXF1•NXT1 onto the mRNP. Here we review 
      recent progress from structural studies of key constituents in different steps of 
      nuclear mRNA export. These findings have laid the foundation for further studies to 
      obtain a comprehensive mechanistic view of the mRNA export pathway.

TI  - A nuclear role for the DEAD-box protein Dbp5 in tRNA export.
LID - 10.7554/eLife.48410 [doi]
LID - e48410
AB  - Dbp5 is an essential DEAD-box protein that mediates nuclear mRNP export. Dbp5 also 
      shuttles between nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments with reported roles in 
      transcription, ribosomal subunit export, and translation; however, the mechanism(s) 
      by which nucleocytoplasmic transport occurs and how Dbp5 specifically contributes to 
      each of these processes remains unclear. Towards understanding the functions and 
      transport of Dbp5 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, alanine scanning mutagenesis was used 
      to generate point mutants at all possible residues within a GFP-Dbp5 reporter. 
      Characterization of the 456 viable mutants led to the identification of an 
      N-terminal Xpo1-dependent nuclear export signal in Dbp5, in addition to other 
      separation-of-function alleles, which together provide evidence that Dbp5 nuclear 
      shuttling is not essential for mRNP export. Rather, disruptions in Dbp5 
      nucleocytoplasmic transport result in tRNA export defects, including changes in tRNA 
      shuttling dynamics during recovery from nutrient stress.

TI  - Inositol hexakisphosphate and Gle1 activate the DEAD-box protein Dbp5 for nuclear 
      mRNA export.
PG  - 711-6
AB  - Regulation of nuclear mRNA export is critical for proper eukaryotic gene expression. 
      A key step in this process is the directional translocation of 
      mRNA-ribonucleoprotein particles (mRNPs) through nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) that 
      are embedded in the nuclear envelope. Our previous studies in Saccharomyces 
      cerevisiae defined an in vivo role for inositol hexakisphosphate (InsP6) and 
      NPC-associated Gle1 in mRNA export. Here, we show that Gle1 and InsP6 act together 
      to stimulate the RNA-dependent ATPase activity of the essential DEAD-box protein 
      Dbp5. Overexpression of DBP5 specifically suppressed mRNA export and growth defects 
      of an ipk1 nup42 mutant defective in InsP6 production and Gle1 localization. In 
      vitro kinetic analysis showed that InsP6 significantly increased Dbp5 ATPase 
      activity in a Gle1-dependent manner and lowered the effective RNA concentration for 
      half-maximal ATPase activity. Gle1 alone had minimal effects. Maximal InsP6 binding 
      required both Dbp5 and Gle1. It has been suggested that Dbp5 requires unidentified 
      cofactors. We now propose that Dbp5 activation at NPCs requires Gle1 and InsP6. This 
      would facilitate spatial control of the remodelling of mRNP protein composition 
      during directional transport and provide energy to power transport cycles.

TI  - Structural and biochemical studies of SLIP1-SLBP identify DBP5 and eIF3g as 
      SLIP1-binding proteins.
PG  - 7960-71
LID - 10.1093/nar/gkt558 [doi]
AB  - In metazoans, replication-dependent histone mRNAs end in a stem-loop structure 
      instead of the poly(A) tail characteristic of all other mature mRNAs. This 
      specialized 3' end is bound by stem-loop binding protein (SLBP), a protein that 
      participates in the nuclear export and translation of histone mRNAs. The 
      translational activity of SLBP is mediated by interaction with SLIP1, a middle 
      domain of initiation factor 4G (MIF4G)-like protein that connects to translation 
      initiation. We determined the 2.5 Å resolution crystal structure of zebrafish SLIP1 
      bound to the translation-activation domain of SLBP and identified the determinants 
      of the recognition. We discovered a SLIP1-binding motif (SBM) in two additional 
      proteins: the translation initiation factor eIF3g and the mRNA-export factor DBP5. 
      We confirmed the binding of SLIP1 to DBP5 and eIF3g by pull-down assays and 
      determined the 3.25 Å resolution structure of SLIP1 bound to the DBP5 SBM. The 
      SBM-binding and homodimerization residues of SLIP1 are conserved in the MIF4G domain 
      of CBP80/20-dependent translation initiation factor (CTIF). The results suggest how 
      the SLIP1 homodimer or a SLIP1-CTIF heterodimer can function as platforms to bridge 
      SLBP with SBM-containing proteins involved in different steps of mRNA metabolism.

TI  - Transport of messenger RNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.
PG  - 299-306
AB  - All movement of molecules and macromolecules between the cytoplasm and the nucleus 
      takes place through nuclear pore complexes (NPCs), very large macromolecular 
      complexes that are the only channels connecting these compartments. mRNA export is 
      mediated by multiple, highly conserved protein factors that couple steps of nuclear 
      pre-mRNA biogenesis to mRNA transport. Mature messenger ribonucleoproteins (mRNPs) 
      diffuse from sites of transcription to NPCs, although some active genes are 
      positioned at the nuclear periphery where they interact physically with components 
      of NPCs. As properly processed mRNPs translocate through the pore, certain mRNP 
      proteins are removed, probably through the enzymatic action of the DEAD-box helicase 
      Dbp5, which binds to Nup159 and Gle1, components of the cytoplasmic filaments of the 
      NPC. Gle1 and the phosphoinositide IP6 activate Dbp5's ATPase activity in vitro and 
      this could provide critical spatial regulation of Dbp5 activity in vivo.

AB  - The mRNA lifecycle is driven through spatiotemporal changes in the protein 
      composition of mRNA particles (mRNPs) that are triggered by RNA-dependent DEAD-box 
      protein (Dbp) ATPases. As mRNPs exit the nuclear pore complex (NPC) in Saccharomyces 
      cerevisiae, this remodeling occurs through activation of Dbp5 by inositol 
      hexakisphosphate (IP(6) )-bound Gle1. At the NPC, Gle1 also binds Nup42, but Nup42's 
      molecular function is unclear. Here we employ the power of structure-function 
      analysis in S. cerevisiae and human (h) cells, and find that the high-affinity 
      Nup42-Gle1 interaction is integral to Dbp5 (hDDX19B) activation and efficient mRNA 
      export. The Nup42 carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) binds Gle1/hGle1B at an interface 
      distinct from the Gle1-Dbp5/hDDX19B interaction site. A nup42-CTD/gle1-CTD/Dbp5 
      trimeric complex forms in the presence of IP(6) . Deletion of NUP42 abrogates 
      Gle1-Dbp5 interaction, and disruption of the Nup42 or IP(6) binding interfaces on 
      Gle1/hGle1B leads to defective mRNA export in S. cerevisiae and human cells. In 
      vitro, Nup42-CTD and IP(6) stimulate Gle1/hGle1B activation of Dbp5 and DDX19B 
      recombinant proteins in similar, nonadditive manners, demonstrating complete 
      functional conservation between humans and S. cerevisiae. Together, a highly 
      conserved mechanism governs spatial coordination of mRNP remodeling during export. 
      This has implications for understanding human disease mutations that perturb the 
      Nup42-hGle1B interaction.

TI  - Translation termination depends on the sequential ribosomal entry of eRF1 and eRF3.
PG  - 4798-4813
LID - 10.1093/nar/gkz177 [doi]
AB  - Translation termination requires eRF1 and eRF3 for polypeptide- and tRNA-release on 
      stop codons. Additionally, Dbp5/DDX19 and Rli1/ABCE1 are required; however, their 
      function in this process is currently unknown. Using a combination of in vivo and in 
      vitro experiments, we show that they regulate a stepwise assembly of the termination 
      complex. Rli1 and eRF3-GDP associate with the ribosome first. Subsequently, Dbp5-ATP 
      delivers eRF1 to the stop codon and in this way prevents a premature access of eRF3. 
      Dbp5 dissociates upon placing eRF1 through ATP-hydrolysis. This in turn enables eRF1 
      to contact eRF3, as the binding of Dbp5 and eRF3 to eRF1 is mutually exclusive. 
      Defects in the Dbp5-guided eRF1 delivery lead to premature contact and premature 
      dissociation of eRF1 and eRF3 from the ribosome and to subsequent stop codon 
      readthrough. Thus, the stepwise Dbp5-controlled termination complex assembly is 
      essential for regular translation termination events. Our data furthermore suggest a 
      possible role of Dbp5/DDX19 in alternative translation termination events, such as 
      during stress response or in developmental processes, which classifies the helicase 
      as a potential drug target for nonsense suppression therapy to treat cancer and 
      neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - mRNA export from the nucleus depends on the ATPase activity of the DEAD-box protein 
      Dbp5/DDX19. Although Dbp5 has measurable ATPase activity alone, several regulatory 
      factors (e.g., RNA, nucleoporin proteins, and the endogenous small molecule InsP6) 
      modulate catalytic activity in vitro and in vivo to facilitate mRNA export. An 
      analysis of the intrinsic and regulator-activated Dbp5 ATPase cycle is necessary to 
      define how these factors control Dbp5 and mRNA export. Here, we report a kinetic and 
      equilibrium analysis of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Dbp5 ATPase cycle, including 
      the influence of RNA on Dbp5 activity. These data show that ATP binds Dbp5 weakly in 
      rapid equilibrium with a binding affinity (KT~4 mM) comparable to the KM for 
      steady-state cycling, while ADP binds an order of magnitude more tightly (KD~0.4 
      mM). The overall intrinsic steady-state cycling rate constant (kcat) is limited by 
      slow, near-irreversible ATP hydrolysis and even slower subsequent phosphate release. 
      RNA increases kcat and rate-limiting Pi release 20-fold, although Pi release 
      continues to limit steady-state cycling in the presence of RNA, in conjunction with 
      RNA binding. Together, this work identifies RNA binding and Pi release as important 
      biochemical transitions within the Dbp5 ATPase cycle and provides a framework for 
      investigating the means by which Dbp5 and mRNA export is modulated by regulatory 
      factors.

LID - 10.1002/wrna.1235 [doi]
AB  - SON is a nuclear protein involved in multiple cellular processes including 
      transcription, pre-messenger RNA (mRNA) splicing, and cell cycle regulation. 
      Although SON was discovered 25 years ago, the importance of SON's function was only 
      realized recently when its roles in nuclear organization and pre-mRNA splicing as 
      well as the influence of these activities in maintaining cellular health were 
      unveiled. Furthermore, SON was implicated to have a key role in stem cells as well 
      as during the onset of various diseases such as cancer, influenza, and hepatitis. 
      Here we review the progress that has been made in studying this multifunctional 
      protein and discuss questions that remain to be answered about SON.

PG  - 2782-2799
LID - 10.1002/1873-3468.13851 [doi]
AB  - Intracellular pathogens affect diverse host cellular defence and metabolic pathways. 
      Here, we used infection with Francisella tularensis to identify SON DNA-binding 
      protein as a central determinant of macrophage activities. RNAi knockdown of SON 
      increases survival of human macrophages following F. tularensis infection or 
      inflammasome stimulation. SON is required for macrophage autophagy, interferon 
      response factor 3 expression, type I interferon response and inflammasome-associated 
      readouts. SON knockdown has gene- and stimulus-specific effects on inflammatory gene 
      expression. SON is required for accurate splicing and expression of GBF1, a key 
      mediator of cis-Golgi structure and function. Chemical GBF1 inhibition has similar 
      effects to SON knockdown, suggesting that SON controls macrophage functions at least 
      in part by controlling Golgi-associated processes.

TI  - SON drives oncogenic RNA splicing in glioblastoma by regulating PTBP1/PTBP2 
      switching and RBFOX2 activity.

AB  - While dysregulation of RNA splicing has been recognized as an emerging target for 
      cancer therapy, the functional significance of RNA splicing and individual splicing 
      factors in brain tumors is poorly understood. Here, we identify SON as a master 
      regulator that activates PTBP1-mediated oncogenic splicing while suppressing 
      RBFOX2-mediated non-oncogenic neuronal splicing in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). 
      SON is overexpressed in GBM patients and SON knockdown causes failure in intron 
      removal from the PTBP1 transcript, resulting in PTBP1 downregulation and inhibition 
      of its downstream oncogenic splicing. Furthermore, SON forms a complex with hnRNP 
      A2B1 and antagonizes RBFOX2, which leads to skipping of RBFOX2-targeted cassette 
      exons, including the PTBP2 neuronal exon. SON knockdown inhibits proliferation and 
      clonogenicity of GBM cells in vitro and significantly suppresses tumor growth in 
      orthotopic xenografts in vivo. Collectively, our study reveals that SON-mediated RNA 
      splicing is a GBM vulnerability, implicating SON as a potential therapeutic target 
      in brain tumors.

TI  - son is necessary for proper vertebrate blood development.
PG  - e0247489

LID - e0247489
AB  - The gene SON is on human chromosome 21 (21q22.11) and is thought to be associated 
      with hematopoietic disorders that accompany Down syndrome. Additionally, SON is an 
      RNA splicing factor that plays a role in the transcription of leukemia-associated 
      genes. Previously, we showed that mutations in SON cause malformations in human and 
      zebrafish spines and brains during early embryonic development. To examine the role 
      of SON in normal hematopoiesis, we reduced expression of the zebrafish homolog of 
      SON in zebrafish at the single-cell developmental stage with specific morpholinos. 
      In addition to the brain and spinal malformations we also observed abnormal blood 
      cell levels upon son knockdown. We then investigated how blood production was 
      altered when levels of son were reduced. Decreased levels of son resulted in lower 
      amounts of red blood cells when visualized with lcr:GFP transgenic fish. There were 
      also reduced thrombocytes seen with cd41:GFP fish, and myeloid cells when mpx:GFP 
      fish were examined. We also observed a significant decrease in the quantity of T 
      cells, visualized with lck:GFP fish. However, when we examined their hematopoietic 
      stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), we saw no difference in colony-forming 
      capability. These studies indicate that son is essential for the proper 
      differentiation of the innate and adaptive immune system, and further investigation 
      determining the molecular pathways involved during blood development should 
      elucidate important information about vertebrate HSPC generation, proliferation, and 
      differentiation.

TI  - Depletion of mRNA export regulator DBP5/DDX19, GLE1 or IPPK that is a key enzyme for 
      the production of IP6, resulting in differentially altered cytoplasmic mRNA 
      expression and specific cell defect.
PG  - e0197165

LID - e0197165
AB  - DBP5, also known as DDX19, GLE1 and inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) function in 
      messenger RNA (mRNA) export at the cytoplasmic surface of the nuclear pore complex 
      in eukaryotic cells. DBP5 is a DEAD-box RNA helicase, and its activity is stimulated 
      by interactions with GLE1 and IP6. In addition, these three factors also have unique 
      role(s). To investigate how these factors influenced the cytoplasmic mRNA expression 
      and cell phenotype change, we performed RNA microarray analysis to detect the effect 
      and function of DBP5, GLE1 and IP6 on the cytoplasmic mRNA expression. The 
      expression of some cytoplasmic mRNA subsets (e.g. cell cycle, DNA replication) was 
      commonly suppressed by the knock-down of DBP5, GLE1 and IPPK (IP6 synthetic enzyme). 
      The GLE1 knock-down selectively reduced the cytoplasmic mRNA expression required for 
      mitotic progression, results in an abnormal spindle phenotype and caused the delay 
      of mitotic process. Meanwhile, G1/S cell cycle arrest was observed in DBP5 and IPPK 
      knock-down cells. Several factors that function in immune response were also 
      down-regulated in DBP5 or IPPK knock-down cells. Thereby, IFNβ-1 mRNA transcription 
      evoked by poly(I:C) treatment was suppressed. These results imply that DBP5, GLE1 
      and IP6 have a conserved and individual function in the cytoplasmic mRNA expression. 
      Variations in phenotype are due to the difference in each function of DBP5, GLE1 and 
      IPPK in intracellular mRNA metabolism.

TI  - Nuclear Export of Pre-Ribosomal Subunits Requires Dbp5, but Not as an RNA-Helicase 
      as for mRNA Export.
PG  - e0149571
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0149571 [doi]
LID - e0149571
AB  - The DEAD-box RNA-helicase Dbp5/Rat8 is known for its function in nuclear mRNA 
      export, where it displaces the export receptor Mex67 from the mRNA at the 
      cytoplasmic side of the nuclear pore complex (NPC). Here we show that Dbp5 is also 
      required for the nuclear export of both pre-ribosomal subunits. Yeast 
      temperature-sensitive dbp5 mutants accumulate both ribosomal particles in their 
      nuclei. Furthermore, Dbp5 genetically and physically interacts with known ribosomal 
      transport factors such as Nmd3. Similar to mRNA export we show that also for 
      ribosomal transport Dbp5 is required at the cytoplasmic side of the NPC. However, 
      unlike its role in mRNA export, Dbp5 does not seem to undergo its ATPase cycle for 
      this function, as ATPase-deficient dbp5 mutants that selectively inhibit mRNA export 
      do not affect ribosomal transport. Furthermore, mutants of GLE1, the ATPase 
      stimulating factor of Dbp5, show no major ribosomal export defects. Consequently, 
      while Dbp5 uses its ATPase cycle to displace the export receptor Mex67 from the 
      translocated mRNAs, Mex67 remains bound to ribosomal subunits upon transit to the 
      cytoplasm, where it is detectable on translating ribosomes. Therefore, we propose a 
      model, in which Dbp5 supports ribosomal transport by capturing ribosomal subunits 
      upon their cytoplasmic appearance at the NPC, possibly by binding export factors 
      such as Mex67. Thus, our findings reveal that although different 
      ribonucleoparticles, mRNAs and pre-ribosomal subunits, use shared export factors, 
      they utilize different transport mechanisms.

AB  - Current models of gene expression, which are based on single-molecule localization 
      microscopy, acknowledge protein clustering and the formation of transcriptional 
      condensates as a driving force of gene expression. However, these models largely 
      omit the role of nuclear lipids and amongst them nuclear phosphatidylinositol 
      phosphates (PIPs) in particular. Moreover, the precise distribution of nuclear PIPs 
      in the functional sub-nuclear domains remains elusive. The direct stochastic optical 
      reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM) provides an unprecedented resolution in 
      biological imaging. Therefore, its use for imaging in the densely crowded cell 
      nucleus is desired but also challenging. Here we present a dual-color dSTORM imaging 
      and image analysis of nuclear PI(4,5)P2, PI(3,4)P2 and PI(4)P distribution while 
      preserving the context of nuclear architecture. In the nucleoplasm, PI(4,5)P2 and 
      PI(3,4)P2 co-pattern in close proximity with the subset of RNA polymerase II foci. 
      PI(4,5)P2 is surrounded by fibrillarin in the nucleoli and all three PIPs are 
      dispersed within the matrix formed by the nuclear speckle protein SON. PI(4,5)P2 is 
      the most abundant nuclear PIP, while PI(4)P is a precursor for the biosynthesis of 
      PI(4,5)P2 and PI(3,4)P2. Therefore, our data are relevant for the understanding the 
      roles of nuclear PIPs and provide further evidence for the model in which nuclear 
      PIPs represent a localization signal for the formation of lipo-ribonucleoprotein 
      hubs in the nucleus. The discussed experimental pipeline is applicable for further 
      functional studies on the role of other nuclear PIPs in the regulation of gene 
      expression and beyond.

TI  - Nuclear export factor RBM15 facilitates the access of DBP5 to mRNA.
PG  - 7151-62
LID - 10.1093/nar/gkp782 [doi]
AB  - The conserved mRNA export receptor NXF1 (Mex67 in yeast) assembles with messenger 
      ribonucleoproteins (mRNP) in the nucleus and guides them through the nuclear pore 
      complex into the cytoplasm. The DEAD family RNA helicase Dbp5 is essential for 
      nuclear export of mRNA and is thought to dissociate Mex67 from mRNP upon 
      translocation, thereby generating directional passage. However, the molecular 
      mechanism by which Dbp5 recognizes Mex67-containing mRNP is not clear. Here we 
      report that the human NXF1-binding protein RBM15 binds specifically to human DBP5 
      and facilitates its direct contact with mRNA in vivo. We found that RBM15 is 
      targeted to the nuclear envelope, where it colocalizes extensively with DBP5 and 
      NXF1. Gene silencing of RBM15 leads to cytoplasmic depletion and nuclear 
      accumulation of general mRNA as well as individual endogenous transcripts, 
      indicating that RBM15 is required for efficient mRNA export. We propose a model in 
      which RBM15 acts locally at the nuclear pore complex, by facilitating the 
      recognition of NXF1-mRNP complexes by DBP5 during translocation, thereby 
      contributing to efficient mRNA export.

TI  - The mRNA export protein DBP5 binds RNA and the cytoplasmic nucleoporin NUP214 in a 
      mutually exclusive manner.
PG  - 247-54
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.1561 [doi]
AB  - The DEAD-box protein DBP5 is essential for mRNA export in both yeast and humans. It 
      binds RNA and is concentrated and locally activated at the cytoplasmic side of the 
      nuclear pore complex. We have determined the crystal structures of human DBP5 bound 
      to RNA and AMPPNP, and bound to the cytoplasmic nucleoporin NUP214. The structures 
      reveal that binding of DBP5 to nucleic acid and to NUP214 is mutually exclusive. 
      Using in vitro assays, we demonstrate that NUP214 decreases both the RNA binding and 
      ATPase activities of DBP5. The interactions are mediated by conserved residues, 
      implying a conserved recognition mechanism. These results suggest a framework for 
      the consecutive steps leading to the release of mRNA at the final stages of nuclear 
      export. More generally, they provide a paradigm for how binding of regulators can 
      specifically inhibit DEAD-box proteins.

TI  - SANS (USH1G) regulates pre-mRNA splicing by mediating the intra-nuclear transfer of 
      tri-snRNP complexes.
PG  - 5845-5866
LID - 10.1093/nar/gkab386 [doi]
AB  - Splicing is catalyzed by the spliceosome, a compositionally dynamic complex 
      assembled stepwise on pre-mRNA. We reveal links between splicing machinery 
      components and the intrinsically disordered ciliopathy protein SANS. Pathogenic 
      mutations in SANS/USH1G lead to Usher syndrome-the most common cause of 
      deaf-blindness. Previously, SANS was shown to function only in the cytosol and 
      primary cilia. Here, we have uncovered molecular links between SANS and pre-mRNA 
      splicing catalyzed by the spliceosome in the nucleus. We show that SANS is found in 
      Cajal bodies and nuclear speckles, where it interacts with components of 
      spliceosomal sub-complexes such as SF3B1 and the large splicing cofactor SON but 
      also with PRPFs and snRNAs related to the tri-snRNP complex. SANS is required for 
      the transfer of tri-snRNPs between Cajal bodies and nuclear speckles for spliceosome 
      assembly and may also participate in snRNP recycling back to Cajal bodies. SANS 
      depletion alters the kinetics of spliceosome assembly, leading to accumulation of 
      complex A. SANS deficiency and USH1G pathogenic mutations affects splicing of genes 
      related to cell proliferation and human Usher syndrome. Thus, we provide the first 
      evidence that splicing dysregulation may participate in the pathophysiology of Usher 
      syndrome.

TI  - Ratcheting mRNA out of the nucleus.
PG  - 327-30
AB  - Export of mature mRNA to the cytoplasm is the culmination of the nuclear portion of 
      eukaryotic gene expression. After transport-competent mature mRNP export complexes 
      are formed in the nucleus, their passage through nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) is 
      facilitated by the Mex67:Mtr2 heterodimer. At the NPC cytoplasmic face, mRNP 
      remodeling prevents its return to the nucleus and so functions as a molecular 
      ratchet imposing directionality on transport. In budding yeast, recent work suggests 
      that the DEAD-box helicase Dbp5 remodels mRNPs at the NPC cytoplasmic face by 
      removing Mex67 and that the Dbp5 ATPase is activated by Gle1 and inositol 
      hexaphosphate (IP(6)).

TI  - The DEAD-box protein Dbp5 controls mRNA export by triggering specific RNA:protein 
      remodeling events.
PG  - 850-9
AB  - Messenger RNA (mRNA) export involves the unidirectional passage of ribonucleoprotein 
      particles (RNPs) through nuclear pore complexes (NPCs), presumably driven by the 
      ATP-dependent activity of the DEAD-box protein Dbp5. Here we report that Dbp5 
      functions as an RNP remodeling protein to displace the RNA-binding protein Nab2 from 
      RNA. Strikingly, the ADP-bound form of Dbp5 and not ATP hydrolysis is required for 
      RNP remodeling. In vivo studies with nab2 and dbp5 mutants show that a Nab2-bound 
      mRNP is a physiological Dbp5 target. We propose that Dbp5 functions as a 
      nucleotide-dependent switch to control mRNA export efficiency and release the mRNP 
      from the NPC.

TI  - The Dbp5 cycle at the nuclear pore complex during mRNA export II: nucleotide cycling 
      and mRNP remodeling by Dbp5 are controlled by Nup159 and Gle1.
PG  - 1065-77
LID - 10.1101/gad.2040611 [doi]
AB  - Essential messenger RNA (mRNA) export factors execute critical steps to mediate 
      directional transport through nuclear pore complexes (NPCs). At cytoplasmic NPC 
      filaments, the ATPase activity of DEAD-box protein Dbp5 is activated by inositol 
      hexakisphosphate (IP(6))-bound Gle1 to mediate remodeling of mRNA-protein (mRNP) 
      complexes. Whether a single Dbp5 executes multiple remodeling events and how Dbp5 is 
      recycled are unknown. Evidence suggests that Dbp5 binding to Nup159 is required for 
      controlling interactions with Gle1 and the mRNP. Using in vitro reconstitution 
      assays, we found here that Nup159 is specifically required for ADP release from 
      Dbp5. Moreover, Gle1-IP(6) stimulates ATP binding, thus priming Dbp5 for RNA 
      loading. In vivo, a dbp5-R256D/R259D mutant with reduced ADP binding bypasses the 
      need for Nup159 interaction. However, NPC spatial control is important, as a 
      dbp5-R256D/R259D nup42Δ double mutant is temperature-sensitive for mRNA export. 
      Further analysis reveals that remodeling requires a conformational shift to the 
      Dbp5-ADP form. ADP release factors for DEAD-box proteins have not been reported 
      previously and reflect a new paradigm for regulation. We propose a model wherein 
      Nup159 and Gle1-IP(6) regulate Dbp5 cycles by controlling its nucleotide-bound 
      state, allowing multiple cycles of mRNP remodeling by a single Dbp5 at the NPC.

TI  - Snx4-assisted vacuolar targeting of transcription factors defines a new autophagy 
      pathway for controlling ATG expression.
PG  - 3547-3565
LID - 10.1080/15548627.2021.1877934 [doi]
AB  - Autophagy, in part, is controlled by the repression and activation of 
      autophagy-related (ATG) genes. Here, we describe a new selective autophagy pathway 
      that targets functional transcriptional regulators to control their activity. This 
      pathway is activated in response to nitrogen starvation and recycles transcriptional 
      activators (Msn2 and Rim15) and a repressor (Ssn2/Med13) of ATG expression. Further 
      analysis of Ssn2/Med13 vacuolar proteolysis revealed that this pathway utilizes the 
      core autophagic machinery. However, it is independent of known nucleophagy 
      mechanisms, receptor proteins, and the scaffold protein Atg11. Instead, Ssn2/Med13 
      exits the nucleus through the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and associates with the 
      cytoplasmic nucleoporin Gle1, a member of the RNA remodeling complex. Dbp5 and 
      Nup159, that act in concert with Gle1, are also required for Ssn2/Med13 clearance. 
      Ssn2/Med13 is retrieved from the nuclear periphery and degraded by Atg17-initiated 
      phagophores anchored to the vacuole. Efficient transfer to phagophores depends on 
      the sorting nexin heterodimer Snx4/Atg24-Atg20, which binds to Atg17, and relocates 
      to the perinucleus following nitrogen starvation. To conclude, this pathway defines 
      a previously undescribed autophagy mechanism that targets select transcriptional 
      regulators for rapid vacuolar proteolysis, utilizing the RNA remodeling complex, the 
      sorting nexin heterodimer Snx4-Atg20, Atg17, and the core autophagic machinery. It 
      is physiologically relevant as this Snx4-assisted vacuolar targeting pathway permits 
      cells to fine-tune the autophagic response by controlling the turnover of both 
      positive and negative regulators of ATG transcription.Abbreviations: AIM: Atg8

TI  - The Dbp5 cycle at the nuclear pore complex during mRNA export I: dbp5 mutants with 
      defects in RNA binding and ATP hydrolysis define key steps for Nup159 and Gle1.
PG  - 1052-64
LID - 10.1101/gad.2041611 [doi]
AB  - Nuclear export of messenger RNA (mRNA) occurs by translocation of mRNA/protein 
      complexes (mRNPs) through nuclear pore complexes (NPCs). The DEAD-box protein Dbp5 
      mediates export by triggering removal of mRNP proteins in a spatially controlled 
      manner. This requires Dbp5 interaction with Nup159 in NPC cytoplasmic filaments and 
      activation of Dbp5's ATPase activity by Gle1 bound to inositol hexakisphosphate 
      (IP(6)). However, the precise sequence of events within this mechanism has not been 
      fully defined. Here we analyze dbp5 mutants that alter ATP binding, ATP hydrolysis, 
      or RNA binding. We found that ATP binding and hydrolysis are required for efficient 
      Dbp5 association with NPCs. Interestingly, mutants defective for RNA binding are 
      dominant-negative (DN) for mRNA export in yeast and human cells. We show that the DN 
      phenotype stems from competition with wild-type Dbp5 for Gle1 at NPCs. The Dbp5-Gle1 
      interaction is limiting for export and, importantly, can be independent of Nup159. 
      Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching experiments in yeast show a very dynamic 
      association between Dbp5 and NPCs, averaging <1 sec, similar to reported NPC 
      translocation rates for mRNPs. This work reveals critical steps in the 
      Gle1-IP(6)/Dbp5/Nup159 cycle, and suggests that the number of remodeling events 
      mediated by a single Dbp5 is limited.

TI  - Nuclear speckle fusion via long-range directional motion regulates speckle 
      morphology after transcriptional inhibition.

AB  - Although the formation of RNA-protein bodies has been studied intensively, their 
      mobility and how their number and size are regulated are still poorly understood. 
      Here, we show significantly increased mobility of nuclear speckles after 
      transcriptional inhibition, including long-range directed motion of one speckle 
      towards another speckle, terminated by speckle fusion, over distances up to 4 µm and 
      with velocities between 0.2 µm/min and 1.5 µm/min. Frequently, three or even four 
      speckles follow very similar paths, with new speckles appearing along the path 
      followed by a preceding speckle. Speckle movements and fusion events contribute to 
      fewer, but larger, speckles after transcriptional inhibition. These speckle 
      movements are not actin dependent, but occur within chromatin-depleted channels 
      enriched with small granules containing the speckle marker protein SON. Similar 
      long-range speckle movements and fusion events were observed after heat shock or 
      heavy metal stress, and during late G2 and early prophase. Our observations suggest 
      a mechanism for long-range, directional nuclear speckle movements, contributing to 
      overall regulation of nuclear speckle number and size as well as overall nuclear 
      organization. This article has an associated First Person interview with the first 
      author of the paper.

TI  - A conserved mechanism of DEAD-box ATPase activation by nucleoporins and InsP6 in 
      mRNA export.
PG  - 238-42
LID - 10.1038/nature09862 [doi]
AB  - Superfamily 1 and superfamily 2 RNA helicases are ubiquitous messenger-RNA-protein 
      complex (mRNP) remodelling enzymes that have critical roles in all aspects of RNA 
      metabolism. The superfamily 2 DEAD-box ATPase Dbp5 (human DDX19) functions in mRNA 
      export and is thought to remodel mRNPs at the nuclear pore complex (NPC). Dbp5 is 
      localized to the NPC via an interaction with Nup159 (NUP214 in vertebrates) and is 
      locally activated there by Gle1 together with the small-molecule inositol 
      hexakisphosphate (InsP(6)). Local activation of Dbp5 at the NPC by Gle1 is essential 
      for mRNA export in vivo; however, the mechanistic role of Dbp5 in mRNP export is 
      poorly understood and it is not known how Gle1(InsP6) and Nup159 regulate the 
      activity of Dbp5. Here we report, from yeast, structures of Dbp5 in complex with 
      Gle1(InsP6), Nup159/Gle1(InsP6) and RNA. These structures reveal that InsP(6) 
      functions as a small-molecule tether for the Gle1-Dbp5 interaction. Surprisingly, 
      the Gle1(InsP6)-Dbp5 complex is structurally similar to another DEAD-box ATPase 
      complex essential for translation initiation, eIF4G-eIF4A, and we demonstrate that 
      Gle1(InsP6) and eIF4G both activate their DEAD-box partner by stimulating RNA 
      release. Furthermore, Gle1(InsP6) relieves Dbp5 autoregulation and cooperates with 
      Nup159 in stabilizing an open Dbp5 intermediate that precludes RNA binding. These 
      findings explain how Gle1(InsP6), Nup159 and Dbp5 collaborate in mRNA export and 
      provide a general mechanism for DEAD-box ATPase regulation by Gle1/eIF4G-like 
      activators.

TI  - Activation of the DExD/H-box protein Dbp5 by the nuclear-pore protein Gle1 and its 
      coactivator InsP6 is required for mRNA export.
PG  - 668-76
AB  - The DExD/H-box ATPase Dbp5 is essential for nuclear mRNA export, although its 
      precise role in this process remains poorly understood. Here, we identify the 
      nuclear pore protein Gle1 as a cellular activator of Dbp5. Dbp5 alone is unable to 
      stably bind RNA or effectively hydrolyse ATP under physiological conditions, but 
      addition of Gle1 dramatically stimulates these activities. A gle1 point mutant 
      deficient for Dbp5 stimulation in vitro displays an mRNA export defect in vivo, 
      indicating that activation of Dbp5 is an essential function of Gle1. Interestingly, 
      Gle1 binds directly to inositol hexakisphosphate (InsP6) and InsP6 potentiates the 
      Gle1-mediated stimulation of Dbp5. Dominant mutations in DBP5 and GLE1 that rescue 
      mRNA export phenotypes associated with the lack of InsP6 mimic the InsP6 effects in 
      vitro. Our results define specific functions for Gle1 and InsP6 in mRNA export and 
      suggest that local activation of Dbp5 at the nuclear pore is critical for mRNA 
      export.

PG  - 37884-94
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M110.148973 [doi]
AB  - Leptin, the product of the ob gene, plays important roles in the regulation of food 
      intake and body weight through its receptor in the hypothalamus. To identify novel 
      transcripts induced by leptin, we performed cDNA subtraction based on selective 
      suppression of the polymerase chain reaction by using mRNA prepared from the 
      forebrain of leptin-injected ob/ob mice. One of the genes isolated was a mouse 
      homolog of human negative regulatory element-binding protein (NREBP). Its expression 
      was markedly increased by leptin in the growth hormone secretagogue-receptor 
      (GHS-R)-positive neurons of the arcuate nucleus and ventromedial hypothalamic 
      nucleus. The promoter region of GHS-R contains one NREBP binding sequence, 
      suggesting that NREBP regulates GHS-R transcription. Luciferase reporter assays 
      showed that NREBP repressed GHS-R promoter activity in a hypothalamic neuronal cell 
      line, GT1-7, and its repressive activity was abolished by the replacement of 
      negative regulatory element in GHS-R promoter. Overexpression of NREBP reduced the 
      protein expression of endogenous GHS-R without affecting the expression of ob-Rb in 
      GT1-7 cells. To determine the functional importance of NREBP in the hypothalamus, we 
      assessed the effects of NREBP on ghrelin action. Although phosphorylation of 
      AMP-activated protein kinase α (AMPKα) was induced by ghrelin in GT1-7 cells, NREBP 
      repressed ghrelin-induced AMPKα phosphorylation. These results suggest that 
      leptin-induced NREBP is an important regulator of GHS-R expression in the 
      hypothalamus and provides a novel molecular link between leptin and ghrelin 
      signaling.

TI  - Structure of the C-terminus of the mRNA export factor Dbp5 reveals the interaction 
      surface for the ATPase activator Gle1.
PG  - 16251-6
LID - 10.1073/pnas.0902251106 [doi]
AB  - The DExD/H-box RNA-dependent ATPase Dbp5 plays an essential role in the nuclear 
      export of mRNA. Dbp5 localizes to the nuclear pore complex, where its ATPase 
      activity is stimulated by Gle1 and its coactivator inositol hexakisphosphate. Here, 
      we present the crystal structure of the C-terminal domain of Dbp5, refined to 1.8 A. 
      The structure reveals a RecA-like fold that contains two defining characteristics 
      not present in other structurally characterized DExD/H-box proteins: a C-terminal 
      alpha-helix and a loop connecting beta5 and alpha4, both of which are composed of 
      conserved and unique elements in the Dbp5 primary sequence. Using structure-guided 
      mutagenesis, we have identified several charged surface residues that, when mutated, 
      weaken the binding of Gle1 and inhibit the ability of Gle1 to stimulate Dbp5's 
      ATPase activity. In vivo analysis of the same mutations reveals that those mutants 
      displaying the weakest ATPase stimulation in vitro are also unable to support yeast 
      growth. Analysis of the correlation between the in vitro and in vivo data indicates 
      that a threshold level of Dbp5 ATPase activity is required for cellular mRNA export 
      that is not met by the unstimulated enzyme, suggesting a possible mechanism by which 
      Dbp5's activity can be modulated to regulate mRNA export.

TI  - Degradation of oligouridylated histone mRNAs: see UUUUU and goodbye.
PG  - 577-89
LID - 10.1002/wrna.1232 [doi]
AB  - During the cell cycle the expression of replication-dependent histones is tightly 
      coupled to DNA synthesis. Histone messenger RNA (mRNA) levels strongly increase 
      during early S-phase and rapidly decrease at the end of it. Here, we review the 
      degradation of replication-dependent histone mRNAs, a paradigm of 
      post-transcriptional gene regulation, in the context of processing, translation, and 
      oligouridylation. Replication-dependent histone transcripts are characterized by the 
      absence of introns and by the presence of a stem-loop structure at the 3' end of a 
      very short 3' untranslated region (UTR). These features, together with a need for 
      active translation, are a prerequisite for their rapid decay. The degradation is 
      induced by 3' end additions of untemplated uridines, performed by terminal uridyl 
      transferases. Such 3' oligouridylated transcripts are preferentially bound by the 
      heteroheptameric LSM1-7 complex, which also interacts with the 3'→5' exonuclease 
      ERI1 (also called 3'hExo). Presumably in cooperation with LSM1-7 and aided by the 
      helicase UPF1, ERI1 degrades through the stem-loop of oligouridylated histone mRNAs 
      in repeated rounds of partial degradation and reoligouridylation. Although histone 
      mRNA decay is now known in some detail, important questions remain open: How is 
      ceasing nuclear DNA replication relayed to the cytoplasmic histone mRNA degradation? 
      Why is translation important for this process? Recent research on factors such as 
      SLIP1, DBP5, eIF3, CTIF, CBP80/20, and ERI1 has provided new insights into the 3' 
      end formation, the nuclear export, and the translation of histone mRNAs. We discuss 
      how these results fit with the preparation of histone mRNAs for degradation, which 
      starts as early as these transcripts are generated.

TI  - SON haploinsufficiency causes impaired pre-mRNA splicing of CAKUT genes and 
      heterogeneous renal phenotypes.
PG  - 1494-1504

AB  - Although genetic testing is increasingly used in clinical nephrology, a large number 
      of patients with congenital abnormalities of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) 
      remain undiagnosed with current gene panels. Therefore, careful curation of novel 
      genetic findings is key to improving diagnostic yields. We recently described a 
      novel intellectual disability syndrome caused by de novo heterozygous 
      loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding the splicing factor SON. Here, we 
      show that many of these patients, including two previously unreported, exhibit a 
      wide array of kidney abnormalities. Detailed phenotyping of 14 patients with SON 
      haploinsufficiency identified kidney anomalies in 8 patients, including horseshoe 
      kidney, unilateral renal hypoplasia, and renal cysts. Recurrent urinary tract 
      infections, electrolyte disturbances, and hypertension were also observed in some 
      patients. SON knockdown in kidney cell lines leads to abnormal pre-mRNA splicing, 
      resulting in decreased expression of several established CAKUT genes. Furthermore, 
      these molecular events were observed in patient-derived cells with SON 
      haploinsufficiency. Taken together, our data suggest that the wide spectrum of 
      phenotypes in patients with a pathogenic SON mutation is a consequence of impaired 
      pre-mRNA splicing of several CAKUT genes. We propose that genetic testing panels 
      designed to diagnose children with a kidney phenotype should include the SON gene.

PG  - 668-680
LID - 10.1007/s13238-019-0637-9 [doi]
AB  - Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) depend on glycolysis for energy and substrates 
      for biosynthesis. To understand the mechanisms governing the metabolism of hESCs, we 
      investigated the transcriptional regulation of glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1, 
      SLC2A1), a key glycolytic gene to maintain pluripotency. By combining the 
      genome-wide data of binding sites of the core pluripotency factors (SOX2, OCT4, 
      NANOG, denoted SON), chromosomal interaction and histone modification in hESCs, we 
      identified a potential enhancer of the GLUT1 gene in hESCs, denoted GLUT1 enhancer 
      (GE) element. GE interacts with the promoter of GLUT1, and the deletion of GE 
      significantly reduces the expression of GLUT1, glucose uptake and glycolysis of 
      hESCs, confirming that GE is an enhancer of GLUT1 in hESCs. In addition, the 
      mutation of SON binding motifs within GE reduced the expression of GLUT1 as well as 
      the interaction between GE and GLUT1 promoter, indicating that the binding of SON to 
      GE is important for its activity. Therefore, SON promotes glucose uptake and 
      glycolysis in hESCs by inducing GLUT1 expression through directly activating the 
      enhancer of GLUT1.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The present study aims to summarize the clinical and genetic 
      characteristics of ZTTK syndrome. METHODS: The clinical and genetic data of a 
      Chinese girl with severe growth and development delay, intellectual disability, and 
      facial features were analyzed. Original articles on ZTTK syndrome published up to 
      November 20l8 were identified from PubMed, Human Gene Mutation Database, Online 
      Mendelian Inheritance in Man, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and WanFang 
      databases using the keywords "ZTTK syndrome" and "SON". RESULTS: The patient was 
      born small for gestational age, and had poor academic performance, delayed language 
      development, and motor retardation. The patient's height was 113 cm (less than -3 
      SD), and had moles on the back skin and possessed facial features. A novel 
      heterozygous mutation c.394C>T (p.Q132X) of SON was found in this patient, but the 
      parents were normal. CONCLUSION: The patient's clinical phenotype was consistent 
      with ZTTK syndrome. The novel heterozygous mutation c.394C>T (p.Q132X) of SON was 
      its pathogenic mutation, which has not been reported at home and abroad.

TI  - Blood pressure by age in childhood and adolescence: a review of 129 surveys 
      worldwide.
PG  - 824-9
AB  - The pre-adult patterns of change in blood pressure with age have been investigated 
      by review and pooled analysis of the relevant worldwide literature. The results 
      indicate, foremost, the almost universal overall upward progression of blood 
      pressure levels between ages 6 and 18 years, separately for systolic, fourth-phase 
      and fifth-phase diastolic pressures (SBP, DBP4, DBP5). This report summarizes 
      results of an extensive literature search based on 129 qualifying publications, in 
      many languages, of which 79 yielded data adequate for a pooled age-sex-specific 
      analysis for boys and girls aged 6-18 years. More than 200,000 observations were 
      available for SBP and nearly 100,000 each for DBP4 and DBP5, respectively. In this 
      overall pool, SBP increased uniformly for boys from age 6-12 and for girls from 6-9, 
      at 1.4 mm Hg/yr; for boys the slope increased abruptly to 3.2 mm Hg/yr from 12-15 
      and fell to 0 at age 18; for girls the maximum increase was only 2.1 mm Hg/yr, from 
      9-13, and it reversed at age 16, reaching -3.4 mm Hg/yr from 17-18. Thus for SBP the 
      absolute values for boys and girls were identical up to age nine and nearly so to 
      age 14 and then separated, with values for girls increasing only slightly to age 16 
      and actually decreasing to age 18. A similar separation of age-specific values by 
      sex occurred with DBP4, but not until age 16, after which DBP4 decreased for 
      girls.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - A single molecule view on Dbp5 and mRNA at the nuclear pore.
PG  - 8-13

AB  - Numerous molecular details of intracellular mRNA processing have been revealed in 
      recent years. However, the export process of single native mRNA molecules, the 
      actual translocation through the nuclear pore complex (NPC), could not yet be 
      examined in vivo. The problem is observing mRNA molecules without interfering with 
      their native behavior. We used a protein-based labeling approach to visualize single 
      native mRNPs in live salivary gland cells of Chironomus tentans, an iconic system 
      used for decades to study the mRNA life cycle. Recombinant hrp36, the C. tentans 
      homolog of mammalian hnRNP A1, was fluorescence labeled and microinjected into 
      living cells, where it was integrated into nascent mRNPs. Intranuclear trajectories 
      of single mRNPs, including their NPC passage, were observed with high space and time 
      resolution employing a custom-built light sheet fluorescence microscope. We analyzed 
      the kinetics and dynamics of mRNP export and started to study its mechanism and 
      regulation by measuring the turnover-kinetics of single Dbp5 at the NPC.

TI  - Hepatitis B Virus X Protein Stimulates Virus Replication Via DNA Methylation of the 
      C-1619 in Covalently Closed Circular DNA.
PG  - 67-78
LID - 10.14348/molcells.2018.0255 [doi]
AB  - Methylation of HBV cccDNA has been detected in vivo and in vitro; however, the 
      mechanism and its effects on HBV replication remain unclear. HBx derived from a 
      1.2-mer HBV replicon upregulated protein levels and enzyme activities of DNA 
      methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), 3a, and 3b, resulting in methylation of the negative 
      regulatory region (NRE) in cccDNA, while none of these effects were observed with an 
      HBx-null mutant. The HBx-positive HBV cccDNA expressed higher levels of HBc and 
      produced about 4-fold higher levels of HBV particles than those from the HBx-null 
      counterpart. For these effects, HBx interrupted the action of NRE binding protein 
      via methylation of the C-1619 within NRE, resulting in activation of the core 
      promoter. Treatment with 5-Aza-2'dC or DNMT1 knock-down drastically impaired the 
      ability of HBx to activate the core promoter and stimulate HBV replication in 
      1.2-mer HBV replicon and in vitro infection systems, indicating the positive role of 
      HBx-mediated cccDNA methylation in HBV replication.

TI  - ZTTK syndrome: Clinical and molecular findings of 15 cases and a review of the 
      literature.
PG  - 3740-3753
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.a.62445 [doi]
AB  - Zhu-Tokita-Takenouchi-Kim (ZTTK) syndrome is caused by de novo loss-of-function 
      variants in the SON gene (MIM #617140). This multisystemic disorder is characterized 
      by intellectual disability, seizures, abnormal brain imaging, variable dysmorphic 
      features, and various congenital anomalies. The wide application and increasing 
      accessibility of whole exome sequencing (WES) has helped to identify new cases of 
      ZTTK syndrome over the last few years. To date, there have been approximately 45 
      cases reported in the literature. Here, we describe 15 additional individuals with 
      variants in the SON gene, including those with missense variants bringing the total 
      number of known cases to 60. We have reviewed the clinical and molecular data of 
      these new cases and all previously reported cases to further delineate the most 
      common as well as emerging clinical findings related to this syndrome. Furthermore, 
      we aim to delineate any genotype-phenotype correlations specifically for a recurring 
      pathogenic four base pair deletion (c.5753_5756del) along with discussing the impact 
      of missense variants seen in the SON gene.

AB  - Single molecule microscopy techniques allow to visualize the translocation of single 
      transport receptors and cargo molecules or particles through nuclear pore complexes. 
      These data indicate that cargo molecule import into the nucleus takes less than 10ms 
      and nuclear export of messenger RNA (mRNA) particles takes 50-350ms, up to several 
      seconds for extremely bulky particles. This review summarizes and discusses 
      experimental results on transport of nuclear transport factor 2 (NTF2), importin β 
      and mRNA particles. Putative regulatory functions of importin β for the NPC 
      transport mechanism and the RNA helicase Dbp5 for mRNA export kinetics are 
      discussed.

      Gle1 structure-function analysis.

AB  - A critical step during gene expression is the directional export of nuclear 
      messenger (m)RNA through nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) to the cytoplasm. During 
      export, Gle1 in conjunction with inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) spatially regulates 
      the activity of the DEAD-box protein Dbp5 at the NPC cytoplasmic face. GLE1 
      mutations are causally linked to the human diseases lethal congenital contracture 
      syndrome 1 (LCCS-1) and lethal arthrogryposis with anterior horn cell disease 
      (LAAHD). Here, structure prediction and functional analysis provide strong evidence 
      to suggest that the LCCS-1 and LAAHD disease mutations disrupt the function of Gle1 
      in mRNA export. Strikingly, direct fluorescence microscopy in living cells reveals a 
      dramatic loss of steady-state NPC localization for GFP-gle1 proteins expressed from 
      human gle1 genes harboring LAAHD and LCCS-1 mutations. The potential significance of 
      these residues is further clarified by analyses of sequence and predicted structural 
      conservation. This work offers insights into the perturbed mechanisms underlying 
      human LCCS-1 and LAAHD disease states and emphasizes the potential impact of altered 
      mRNA transport and gene expression in human disease.

TI  - Tap and Dbp5, but not Gag, are involved in DR-mediated nuclear export of unspliced 
      Rous sarcoma virus RNA.
PG  - 376-86
AB  - All retroviruses must circumvent cellular restrictions on the export of unspliced 
      RNAs from the nucleus. While the unspliced RNA export pathways for HIV and 
      Mason-Pfizer monkey virus are well characterized, that of Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) 
      is not. We have previously reported that the RSV direct repeat (DR) elements are 
      involved in the cytoplasmic accumulation of unspliced viral RNA. Here, using 
      fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), we demonstrate that unspliced viral RNAs 
      bearing a single point mutation (G8863C) in the DR exhibit a restricted cellular 
      localization in and around the nucleus. In contrast, wild type unspliced viral RNA 
      had a diffuse localization throughout the nucleus and cytoplasm. Since the RSV Gag 
      protein has a transient localization in the nucleus, we examined the effect of Gag 
      over-expression on a DR-mediated reporter construct. While Gag did not enhance 
      DR-mediated nuclear export, the dominant-negative expression of two cellular export 
      factors, Tap and Dbp5, inhibited expression of the same reporter construct. 
      Furthermore, FISH studies using the dominant-negative Dbp5 demonstrated that 
      unspliced wild type RSV RNA was retained within the nucleus. Taken together, these 
      results further implicate the DR in nuclear RNA export through interactions with Tap 
      and Dbp5.

TI  - Gle1 is a multifunctional DEAD-box protein regulator that modulates Ded1 in 
      translation initiation.
PG  - 39750-9
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M111.299321 [doi]
AB  - DEAD-box protein (Dbp) family members are essential for gene expression; however, 
      their precise roles and regulation are not fully defined. During messenger (m)RNA 
      export, Gle1 bound to inositol hexakisphosphate (IP(6)) acts via Dbp5 to facilitate 
      remodeling of mRNA-protein complexes. In contrast, here we define a novel Gle1 role 
      in translation initiation through regulation of a different DEAD-box protein, the 
      initiation factor Ded1. We find that Gle1 physically and genetically interacts with 
      Ded1. Surprisingly, whereas Gle1 stimulates Dbp5, it inhibits Ded1 ATPase activity 
      in vitro, and IP(6) does not affect this inhibition. Functionally, a gle1-4 mutant 
      specifically suppresses initiation defects in a ded1-120 mutant, and ded1 and gle1 
      mutants have complementary perturbations in AUG start site recognition. Consistent 
      with this role in initiation, Gle1 inhibits translation in vitro in competent 
      extracts. These results indicate that Gle1 has a direct role in initiation and 
      negatively regulates Ded1. Together, the differential regulation of two distinct 
      DEAD-box proteins by a common factor (Gle1) establishes a new paradigm for 
      controlling gene expression and coupling translation with mRNA export.

LID - 10.1016/j.bbagrm.2012.02.017 [doi]
AB  - Most of the individual components of the nuclear elements of the gene expression 
      pathway have been identified and high-resolution structural information is becoming 
      available for many of them. Information is also starting to become available on the 
      larger complexes they form and is beginning to give clues about how the dynamics of 
      their interactions generate function. Although the translocation of export-competent 
      messenger ribonucleoprotein particles (mRNPs) through the nuclear pore transport 
      channel that is mediated by interactions with nuclear pore proteins (nucleoporins) 
      is relatively well understood, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying the 
      assembly of export-competent mRNPs in the nucleus and their Dbp5-mediated 
      disassembly in the cytoplasm is less well defined. Considerable information has been 
      obtained on the structure of Dbp5 in its different nucleotide-bound states and in 
      complex with Gle1 or Nup159/NUP214. Although the precise manner by which the Dbp5 
      ATPase cycle is coupled to mRNP remodelling remains to be established, current 
      models capture many key details of this process. The formation of export-competent 
      mRNPs in the nucleus remains an elusive component of this pathway and the precise 
      nature of the remodelling that generates these mRNPs as well as detailed 
      understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which this step is integrated with the 
      transcriptional, splicing and polyadenylation machinery by the TREX and TREX-2 
      complexes remain obscure. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Nuclear 
      Transport and RNA Processing.

TI  - The mRNA export factor Dbp5 is associated with Balbiani ring mRNP from gene to 
      cytoplasm.
PG  - 1177-87
AB  - The DEAD box RNA helicase Dbp5 is essential for nucleocytoplasmic transport of 
      mRNA-protein (mRNP) complexes. Dbp5 is present mainly in the cytoplasm and is 
      enriched at the cytoplasmic side of nuclear pore complexes (NPCs), suggesting that 
      it acts in the late part of mRNP export. Here, we visualize the assembly and 
      transport of a specific mRNP particle, the Balbiani ring mRNP in the dipteran 
      Chironomus tentans, and show that a Dbp5 homologue in C.tentans, Ct-Dbp5, binds to 
      pre-mRNP co-transcriptionally and accompanies the mRNP to and through the nuclear 
      pores and into the cytoplasm. We also demonstrate that Ct-Dbp5 accumulates in the 
      nucleus and partly disappears from the NPC when nuclear export of mRNA is inhibited. 
      The fact that Ct-Dbp5 is present along the exiting mRNP fibril extending from the 
      nuclear pore into the cytoplasm supports the view that Ct-Dbp5 is involved in 
      restructuring the mRNP prior to translation. Finally, the addition of the export 
      factor Dbp5 to the growing transcript highlights the importance of the 
      co-transcriptional loading process in determining the fate of mRNA.

TI  - SON and Its Alternatively Spliced Isoforms Control MLL Complex-Mediated H3K4me3 and 
      Transcription of Leukemia-Associated Genes.

AB  - Dysregulation of MLL complex-mediated histone methylation plays a pivotal role in 
      gene expression associated with diseases, but little is known about cellular factors 
      modulating MLL complex activity. Here, we report that SON, previously known as an 
      RNA splicing factor, controls MLL complex-mediated transcriptional initiation. SON 
      binds to DNA near transcription start sites, interacts with menin, and inhibits MLL 
      complex assembly, resulting in decreased H3K4me3 and transcriptional repression. 
      Importantly, alternatively spliced short isoforms of SON are markedly upregulated in 
      acute myeloid leukemia. The short isoforms compete with full-length SON for 
      chromatin occupancy but lack the menin-binding ability, thereby antagonizing 
      full-length SON function in transcriptional repression while not impairing 
      full-length SON-mediated RNA splicing. Furthermore, overexpression of a short 
      isoform of SON enhances replating potential of hematopoietic progenitors. Our 
      findings define SON as a fine-tuner of the MLL-menin interaction and reveal short 
      SON overexpression as a marker indicating aberrant transcriptional initiation in 
      leukemia.

TI  - Mechanistic insights into mRNA export through structures of Dbp5.
PG  - 23-7
AB  - Nuclear export of mRNA is a critical event in mRNA biogenesis. Passage of mature 
      messenger ribonucleoproteins (mRNPs) through nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) is 
      facilitated by the Mex67/Mtr2 heterodimer. At the NPC cytoplasmic face, the DEAD-box 
      RNA helicase Dbp5 remodels mRNPs by removing Mex67/Mtr2. This remodeling process 
      prevents mRNPs from returning to the nucleus, thereby imposing unidirectionality on 
      mRNA export. Biochemical studies show that Gle1 and inositol hexaphosphate (IP6) 
      activate Dbp5's ATPase activity at the cytoplasmic face of NPC, therefore providing 
      critical spatial regulation of mRNP remodeling during directional transport. Recent 
      structural studies on Dbp5 in free form and in complex with its ligands (ADP, 
      AMPPNP/RNA) as well as with cytoplasmic nucleoporin Nup214 reveal that the binding 
      of ADP or AMPPNP/RNA induces large conformational changes of Dbp5, and RNA and 
      NUP214 bind to Dbp5 in a mutually exclusive manner. These structural data combined 
      with complementary functional analysis significantly advance our understanding on 
      the mechanism governing mRNA export albeit some key issues remain elusive.

TI  - From PREDs and open reading frames to cDNA isolation: revisiting the human 
      chromosome 21 transcription map.
PG  - 46-54
AB  - A supernumerary copy of human chromosome 21 (HC21) causes Down syndrome. To 
      understand the molecular pathogenesis of Down syndrome, it is necessary to identify 
      all HC21 genes. The first annotation of the sequence of 21q confirmed 127 genes, and 
      predicted an additional 98 previously unknown "anonymous" genes (predictions (PREDs) 
      and open reading frames (C21orfs)), which were foreseen by exon prediction programs 
      and/or spliced expressed sequence tags. These putative gene models still need to be 
      confirmed as bona fide transcripts. Here we report the characterization and 
      expression pattern of the putative transcripts C21orf7, C21orf11, C21orf15, 
      C21orf18, C21orf19, C21orf22, C21orf42, C21orf50, C21orf51, C21orf57, and C21orf58, 
      the GC-rich sequence DNA-binding factor candidate GCFC (also known as C21orf66), 
      PRED12, PRED31, PRED34, PRED44, PRED54, and PRED56. Our analysis showed that most of 
      the C21orfs originally defined by matching spliced expressed sequence tags were 
      correctly predicted, whereas many of the PREDs, defined solely by computer 
      prediction, do not correspond to genuine genes. Four of the six PREDs were 
      incorrectly predicted: PRED44 and C21orf11 are portions of the same transcript, 
      PRED31 is a pseudogene, and PRED54 and PRED56 were wrongly predicted. In contrast, 
      PRED12 (now called C21orf68) and PRED34 (C21orf63) are now confirmed transcripts. We 
      identified three new genes, C21orf67, C21orf69, and C21orf70, not previously 
      predicted by any programs. This revision of the HC21 transcriptome has consequences 
      for the entire genome regarding the quality of previous annotations and the total 
      number of transcripts. It also provides new candidates for genes involved in Down 
      syndrome and other genetic disorders that map to HC21.

TI  - The DEAD-box RNA helicase Dbp5 functions in translation termination.
PG  - 646-9
AB  - In eukaryotes, termination of messenger RNA (mRNA) translation is mediated by the 
      release factors eRF1 and eRF3. Using Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model organism, 
      we have identified a member of the DEAD-box protein (DBP) family, the DEAD-box RNA 
      helicase and mRNA export factor Dbp5, as a player in translation termination. Dbp5 
      interacts genetically with both release factors and the polyadenlyate-binding 
      protein Pab1. A physical interaction was specifically detected with eRF1. Moreover, 
      we show that the helicase activity of Dbp5 is required for efficient stop-codon 
      recognition, and intact Dbp5 is essential for recruitment of eRF3 into termination 
      complexes. Therefore, Dbp5 controls the eRF3-eRF1 interaction and thus eRF3-mediated 
      downstream events.

TI  - Systolic and fourth- and fifth-phase diastolic blood pressure from ages 8 to 18 
      years: Project HeartBeat!
PG  - S86-96
LID - 10.1016/j.amepre.2009.04.014 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Systolic and fourth-phase and fifth-phase diastolic blood pressure (SBP, 
      DBP4, DBP5) have appeared to differ in their patterns of age-related change, and SBP 
      and DBP5 differ in their respective associations with anthropometric variables. 
      Project HeartBeat! investigated trajectories of change in SBP, DBP4, and SBP5 with 
      age and their relationships with indices of adiposity, controlling for energy 
      intake, physical activity, and sexual maturation. METHODS: Project HeartBeat! was a 
      mixed longitudinal study in 678 black and white girls and boys aged 8, 11, or 14 
      years at first examination, followed at 4-month intervals for up to 4 years 
      (1991-1995). A statistical model was estimated for the trajectory of change in each 
      blood pressure measure from ages 8 to 18 years. RESULTS: For SBP, DBP4, and DBP5, 
      the trajectories were sigmoid, parabolic, and linear in form, respectively. SBP and 
      DBP4 differed significantly by gender; DBP4 and DBP5 were significantly related to 
      race. Adjusted for age, gender, and race, all relationships of adiposity-related 
      variables (percent body fat, abdominal circumference, skinfold thickness, and BMI 
      and its fat and fat-free components) with SBP were positive and significant. 
      Corresponding relationships for DBP4 were notably weaker but significant, and for 
      DBP5, weak or not significant. After adjusting for diet, physical inactivity, and 
      maturation, no DBP5 relationship with adiposity indices remained significant. 
      CONCLUSIONS: SBP, DBP4, and DBP5 are distinct in patterns of change with age, 
      relationships to gender and race, and patterns of association with multiple 
      anthropometric indices related to adiposity.

TI  - An in vivo control map for the eukaryotic mRNA translation machinery.
PG  - 635
LID - 10.1038/msb.2012.73 [doi]
AB  - Rate control analysis defines the in vivo control map governing yeast protein 
      synthesis and generates an extensively parameterized digital model of the 
      translation pathway. Among other non-intuitive outcomes, translation demonstrates a 
      high degree of functional modularity and comprises a non-stoichiometric combination 
      of proteins manifesting functional convergence on a shared maximal translation rate. 
      In exponentially growing cells, polypeptide elongation (eEF1A, eEF2, and eEF3) 
      exerts the strongest control. The two other strong control points are recruitment of 
      mRNA and tRNA(i) to the 40S ribosomal subunit (eIF4F and eIF2) and termination 
      (eRF1; Dbp5). In contrast, factors that are found to promote mRNA scanning 
      efficiency on a longer than-average 5'untranslated region (eIF1, eIF1A, Ded1, eIF2B, 
      eIF3, and eIF5) exceed the levels required for maximal control. This is expected to 
      allow the cell to minimize scanning transition times, particularly for longer 
      5'UTRs. The analysis reveals these and other collective adaptations of control 
      shared across the factors, as well as features that reflect functional modularity 
      and system robustness. Remarkably, gene duplication is implicated in the fine 
      control of cellular protein synthesis.

TI  - Son is essential for nuclear speckle organization and cell cycle progression.
PG  - 650-63
AB  - Subnuclear organization and spatiotemporal regulation of pre-mRNA processing factors 
      is essential for the production of mature protein-coding mRNAs. We have discovered 
      that a large protein called Son has a novel role in maintaining proper nuclear 
      organization of pre-mRNA processing factors in nuclear speckles. The primary 
      sequence of Son contains a concentrated region of multiple unique tandem repeat 
      motifs that may support a role for Son as a scaffolding protein for RNA processing 
      factors in nuclear speckles. We used RNA interference (RNAi) approaches and 
      high-resolution microscopy techniques to study the functions of Son in the context 
      of intact cells. Although Son precisely colocalizes with pre-mRNA splicing factors 
      in nuclear speckles, its depletion by RNAi leads to cell cycle arrest in metaphase 
      and causes dramatic disorganization of small nuclear ribonuclear protein and 
      serine-arginine rich protein splicing factors during interphase. Here, we propose 
      that Son is essential for appropriate subnuclear organization of pre-mRNA splicing 
      factors and for promoting normal cell cycle progression.

      mRNA nuclear export.
PG  - 20704-15
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M110.107276 [doi]
AB  - Following transcription, mRNA is processed, packaged into messenger 
      ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) particles, and transported through nuclear pores (NPCs) to 
      the cytoplasm. At the NPC cytoplasmic face, Dbp5 mediates mRNP remodeling and mRNA 
      export factor dissociation, releasing transcripts for translation. In Saccharomyces 
      cerevisiae, the conserved poly(A) RNA-binding protein, Nab2, facilitates NPC 
      targeting of transcripts and also modulates poly(A) tail length. Dbp5 removes Nab2 
      from mRNPs at the cytoplasmic face of the pore and, importantly, a Nab2 RNA-binding 
      mutant suppresses the thermosensitive rat8-2 (dbp5) mutant. GFD1 is a multicopy 
      suppressor of rat8-2 (dbp5), and Gfd1 interacts physically with both Dbp5 and the 
      Nab2 N-terminal domain (Nab2-N). Here, we present a structural and functional 
      analysis of the Gfd1/Nab2-N interaction. Crystallography, supported by solution NMR, 
      shows that Gfd1 residues 126-150 form an alpha-helix when bound to Nab2-N. 
      Engineered Nab2-N and Gfd1 mutants that inhibit this interaction in vitro were used 
      to probe its function in vivo using the genetic interaction between GFD1 and NAB2. 
      Although GFD1 is not essential for viability, its deletion severely impairs growth 
      of rat8-2 (dbp5) cells. Moreover, although Gfd1 overexpression suppresses rat8-2 
      (dbp5), Gfd1 mutants that do not bind Nab2 only partially suppress rat8-2 (dbp5). 
      Furthermore, rat8-2 (dbp5) cells that express nab2-Y34A, in which binding to Gfd1 is 
      impaired, show a synthetic growth phenotype and nuclear accumulation of poly(A) RNA. 
      These data support the importance of the Gfd1/Nab2 interaction for Dbp5 activity and 
      provide further molecular details of the interactions that facilitate Dbp5-mediated 
      mRNP remodeling in the terminal step of mRNA export.

      identification of a new protein with unusual structure and homology with DNA-binding 
      proteins].
PG  - 794-801
AB  - From the human embryonic cDNA library a son3 transcript was cloned and sequenced 
      (1454 base pairs). Determination of its sequence revealed only one open reading 
      frame, whereas five other frames contained a number of termination codons. 
      Translation of the son3 sequence in the unique open reading frame into the amino 
      acid sequence by computer and comparison with the NBRF protein data bank showed that 
      the son3 fragment codes for a new previously unknown polypeptide with the following 
      properties: a) it contains a cluster of short tandemly arranged repeats 7-12 amino 
      acid in length located in the middle part of son3; b) it comprises a region 
      homologous to DNA binding structural proteins (for example, gallin, 55%) and to 
      regulatory proteins coded by the family of proto-oncogene myc; c) it comprises a 
      region homologous to the oncoprotein coded by proto-oncogene mos (human, murine).

AB  - Zhu-Tokita-Takenouchi-Kim (ZTTK) syndrome, a rare congenital anomaly syndrome 
      characterized by intellectual disability, brain malformation, facial dysmorphism, 
      musculoskeletal abnormalities, and some visceral malformations is caused by de novo 
      heterozygous mutations of the SON gene. The nuclear protein SON is involved in gene 
      transcription and RNA splicing; however, the roles of SON in neural development 
      remain undetermined. We investigated the effects of Son knockdown on neural 
      development in mice and found that Son knockdown in neural progenitors resulted in 
      defective migration during corticogenesis and reduced spine density on mature 
      cortical neurons. The induction of human wild-type SON expression rescued these 
      neural abnormalities, confirming that the abnormalities were caused by SON 
      insufficiency. We also applied truncated SON proteins encoded by disease-associated 
      mutant SON genes for rescue experiments and found that a truncated SON protein 
      encoded by the most prevalent SON mutant found in ZTTK syndrome rescued the neural 
      abnormalities while another much shorter mutant SON protein did not. These data 
      indicate that SON insufficiency causes neuronal migration defects and dendritic 
      spine abnormalities, which seem neuropathological bases of the neural symptoms of 
      ZTTK syndrome. In addition, the results support that the neural abnormalities in 
      ZTTK syndrome are caused by SON haploinsufficiency independent of the types of 
      mutation that results in functional or dysfunctional proteins.

TI  - Dbp5, a DEAD-box protein required for mRNA export, is recruited to the cytoplasmic 
      fibrils of nuclear pore complex via a conserved interaction with CAN/Nup159p.
PG  - 4332-47
AB  - Dbp5 is a DEAD-box protein essential for mRNA export from the nucleus in yeast. Here 
      we report the isolation of a cDNA encoding human Dbp5 (hDbp5) which is 46% identical 
      to yDbp5p. Like its yeast homologue, hDbp5 is localized within the cytoplasm and at 
      the nuclear rim. By immunoelectron microscopy, the nuclear envelope-bound fraction 
      of Dbp5 has been localized to the cytoplasmic fibrils of the nuclear pore complex 
      (NPC). Consistent with this localization, we show that both the human and yeast 
      proteins directly interact with an N-terminal region of the nucleoporins 
      CAN/Nup159p. In a conditional yeast strain in which Nup159p is degraded when shifted 
      to the nonpermissive temperature, yDbp5p dissociates from the NPC and localizes to 
      the cytoplasm. Thus, Dbp5 is recruited to the NPC via a conserved interaction with 
      CAN/Nup159p. To investigate its function, we generated defective hDbp5 mutants and 
      analysed their effects in RNA export by microinjection in Xenopus oocytes. A mutant 
      protein containing a Glu-->Gln change in the conserved DEAD-box inhibited the 
      nuclear exit of mRNAs. Together, our data indicate that Dbp5 is a conserved 
      RNA-dependent ATPase which is recruited to the cytoplasmic fibrils of the NPC where 
      it participates in the export of mRNAs out of the nucleus.

TI  - New discoveries of old SON: a link between RNA splicing and cancer.
PG  - 224-31
LID - 10.1002/jcb.24672 [doi]
AB  - The SON protein is a ubiquitously expressed DNA- and RNA-binding protein primarily 
      localized to nuclear speckles. Although several early studies implicated SON in 
      DNA-binding, tumorigenesis and apoptosis, functional significance of this protein 
      had not been recognized until recent studies discovered SON as a novel RNA splicing 
      co-factor. During constitutive RNA splicing, SON ensures efficient intron removal 
      from the transcripts containing suboptimal splice sites. Importantly, SON-mediated 
      splicing is required for proper processing of selective transcripts related to cell 
      cycle, microtubules, centrosome maintenance, and genome stability. Moreover, SON 
      regulates alternative splicing of RNAs from the genes involved in apoptosis and 
      epigenetic modification. In addition to the role in RNA splicing, SON has an ability 
      to suppress transcriptional activation at certain promoter/enhancer DNA sequences. 
      Considering the multiple SON target genes which are directly involved in cell 
      proliferation, genome stability and chromatin modifications, SON is an emerging 
      player in gene regulation during cancer development and progression. Here, we 
      summarize available information from several early studies on SON, and highlight 
      recent discoveries describing molecular mechanisms of SON-mediated gene regulation. 
      We propose that our future effort on better understanding of diverse SON functions 
      would reveal novel targets for cancer therapy.

TI  - Regulation of the Dbp5 ATPase cycle in mRNP remodeling at the nuclear pore: a lively 
      new paradigm for DEAD-box proteins.
PG  - 1109-14
AB  - It is commonly assumed that all DEAD-box ATPases function via a shared mechanism, 
      since this is the case for the few proteins characterized thus far. Hodge and 
      colleagues (pp. 1052-1064) and Noble and colleagues (pp. 1065-1077) now describe a 
      novel model for Dbp5's ATPase cycle in mRNA (messenger RNA)/protein complex (mRNP) 
      remodeling during nuclear export. Notably, unlike other DEAD-box proteins, Dbp5 uses 
      a conformational change distinct from ATP hydrolysis for its activity and requires 
      an ADP release factor to reset its ATPase cycle.

TI  - Quantitative analysis of multilayer organization of proteins and RNA in nuclear 
      speckles at super resolution.
PG  - 4180-4192
LID - 10.1242/jcs.206854 [doi]
AB  - Nuclear speckles are self-assembled organelles composed of RNAs and proteins. They 
      are proposed to act as structural domains that control distinct steps in gene 
      expression, including transcription, splicing and mRNA export. Earlier studies 
      identified differential localization of a few components within the speckles. It was 
      speculated that the spatial organization of speckle components might contribute 
      directly to the order of operations that coordinate distinct processes. Here, by 
      performing multi-color structured illumination microscopy, we characterized the 
      multilayer organization of speckles at a higher resolution. We found that SON and 
      SC35 (also known as SRSF2) localize to the central region of the speckle, whereas 
      MALAT1 and small nuclear (sn)RNAs are enriched at the speckle periphery. 
      Coarse-grained simulations indicate that the non-random organization arises due to 
      the interplay between favorable sequence-encoded intermolecular interactions of 
      speckle-resident proteins and RNAs. Finally, we observe positive correlation between 
      the total amount of RNA present within a speckle and the speckle size. These results 
      imply that speckle size may be regulated to accommodate RNA accumulation and 
      processing. Accumulation of RNA from various actively transcribed speckle-associated 
      genes could contribute to the observed speckle size variations within a single cell.

TI  - The N-terminal domain of Nup159 forms a beta-propeller that functions in mRNA export 
      by tethering the helicase Dbp5 to the nuclear pore.
PG  - 749-60
AB  - Nuclear export of mRNA in eukaryotic cells is mediated by soluble transport factors 
      and components of the nuclear pore complex (NPC). The cytoplasmically oriented 
      nuclear pore protein Nup159 plays a critical role in mRNA export through its 
      conserved N-terminal domain (NTD). Here, we report the crystal structure of the 
      Nup159 NTD, refined to 2.5 A. The structure reveals an unusually asymmetric 
      seven-bladed beta-propeller that is structurally conserved throughout eukarya. Using 
      structure-based conservation analysis, we have targeted specific surface residues 
      for mutagenesis. Residue substitutions in a conserved loop of the NTD abolish in 
      vitro binding to Dbp5, a DEAD box helicase required for mRNA export. In vivo, these 
      mutations cause Dbp5 mislocalization and block mRNA export. These findings suggest 
      that the Nup159 NTD functions in mRNA export as a binding platform, tethering 
      shuttling Dbp5 molecules at the nuclear periphery and locally concentrating this 
      mRNA remodeling factor at the cytoplasmic face of the NPC.

TI  - Nucleoporin FG domains facilitate mRNP remodeling at the cytoplasmic face of the 
      nuclear pore complex.
PG  - 1213-24
LID - 10.1534/genetics.114.164012 [doi]
AB  - Directional export of messenger RNA (mRNA) protein particles (mRNPs) through nuclear 
      pore complexes (NPCs) requires multiple factors. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the 
      NPC proteins Nup159 and Nup42 are asymmetrically localized to the cytoplasmic face 
      and have distinct functional domains: a phenylalanine-glycine (FG) repeat domain 
      that docks mRNP transport receptors and domains that bind the DEAD-box ATPase Dbp5 
      and its activating cofactor Gle1, respectively. We speculated that the Nup42 and 
      Nup159 FG domains play a role in positioning mRNPs for the terminal mRNP-remodeling 
      steps carried out by Dbp5. Here we find that deletion (Δ) of both the Nup42 and 
      Nup159 FG domains results in a cold-sensitive poly(A)+ mRNA export defect. The 
      nup42ΔFG nup159ΔFG mutant also has synthetic lethal genetic interactions with dbp5 
      and gle1 mutants. RNA cross-linking experiments further indicate that the nup42ΔFG 
      nup159ΔFG mutant has a reduced capacity for mRNP remodeling during export. To 
      further analyze the role of these FG domains, we replaced the Nup159 or Nup42 FG 
      domains with FG domains from other Nups. These FG "swaps" demonstrate that only 
      certain FG domains are functional at the NPC cytoplasmic face. Strikingly, fusing 
      the Nup42 FG domain to the carboxy-terminus of Gle1 bypasses the need for the 
      endogenous Nup42 FG domain, highlighting the importance of proximal positioning for 
      these factors. We conclude that the Nup42 and Nup159 FG domains target the mRNP to 
      Gle1 and Dbp5 for mRNP remodeling at the NPC. Moreover, these results provide key 
      evidence that character and context play a direct role in FG domain function and 
      mRNA export.

TI  - A novel dual Dbp5/DDX19 homologue from Plasmodium falciparum requires Q motif for 
      activity.
PG  - 58-63

AB  - Helicases are ubiquitous essential enzymes which have significant role in the 
      nucleic acid metabolism. Using in silico approaches in the recent past we have 
      identified a number of helicases in the Plasmodium falciparum genome. In the present 
      study we report purification and detailed characterization of a novel helicase from 
      P. falciparum. Our results indicate that this helicase is a homologue of Dbp5 and 
      DDX19 from yeast and human, respectively. The biochemical characterization shows 
      that it contains DNA and RNA unwinding, nucleic acid dependent ATPase and RNA 
      binding activities. It is interesting to note that this enzyme can unwind DNA 
      duplexes in both 5' to 3' and 3' to 5' directions. Using truncated derivatives we 
      further show that Q motif is essentially required for all of its activities. These 
      studies should make an important contribution in understanding the enzymes involved 
      in nucleic acid metabolism in the parasite.

AB  - Gene expression dynamics can be measured in single living cells. Using a detectable 
      transcriptionally active gene in living cells, we previously found that an mRNA 
      undergoing several splicing events was retained at this gene after transcription 
      until completion of mRNA processing. To determine the reason for this delay in 
      release and whether mRNA retention on the gene might depend on splicing factor 
      availability, we modulated the levels of splicing factors in the nucleus. Increasing 
      the abundance of the diffusing fraction of splicing factors by their overexpression 
      or by Clk1 kinase overexpression to disassemble nuclear speckles, led to a reduction 
      in splicing factor residence times on the active gene, and the retained mRNA was 
      rapidly released from the gene. Other treatments such as overexpression of a mutant 
      inactive Clk1, the downregulation of MALAT1 lncRNA or of the Son protein, or the 
      overexpression of the splicing factor import factor TNPO3, did not affect the 
      dynamics of mRNA release from the gene. We found that the faster release of the mRNA 
      from the gene mediated by increased availability of splicing factors, was dependent 
      on the RS domain of the splicing factors and its phosphorylation state. We propose 
      that the relative abundancies of splicing factors in the nucleoplasm can affect 
      their availability for the splicing events taking place, and regulate the kinetics 
      of mRNA release from the gene after processing.

AB  - We have recently reported the isolation and characterization of Plasmodium 
      falciparum Dbp5/DDX19 homolog PfD66 and the results indicate that it contains 
      ATP-dependent bipolar DNA and RNA unwinding activity, intrinsic nucleic 
      acid-dependent ATPase and RNA-binding activities. In the present study we report the 
      effect of a number of compounds such as actinomycin D, aphidicolin, camptothecin, 
      cyclophosphamide, 4',6'-di-amidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), daunorubicin, distamycin, 
      ethidium bromide, ellipticine, genistein, mitoxantrone, nalidixic acid, netropsin, 
      nogalamycin, novobiocin and VP-16 on the DNA unwinding and ATPase activities of 
      PfD66. The results indicate that DAPI, ethidium bromide, netropsin and nogalamycin 
      efficiently inhibited the helicase and ATPase activities of PfD66. These studies 
      will make an important contribution in understanding the mechanism of DNA unwinding 
      by Plasmodium falciparum helicase PfD66.

TI  - Control of mRNA export and translation termination by inositol hexakisphosphate 
      requires specific interaction with Gle1.
PG  - 16683-92

AB  - The unidirectional translocation of messenger RNA (mRNA) through the aqueous channel 
      of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) is mediated by interactions between soluble mRNA 
      export factors and distinct binding sites on the NPC. At the cytoplasmic side of the 
      NPC, the conserved mRNA export factors Gle1 and inositol hexakisphosphate (IP(6)) 
      play an essential role in mRNA export by activating the ATPase activity of the 
      DEAD-box protein Dbp5, promoting localized messenger ribonucleoprotein complex 
      remodeling, and ensuring the directionality of the export process. In addition, 
      Dbp5, Gle1, and IP(6) are also required for proper translation termination. However, 
      the specificity of the IP(6)-Gle1 interaction in vivo is unknown. Here, we 
      characterize the biochemical interaction between Gle1 and IP(6) and the relationship 
      to Dbp5 binding and stimulation. We identify Gle1 residues required for IP(6) 
      binding and show that these residues are needed for IP(6)-dependent Dbp5 stimulation 
      in vitro. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Gle1 is the primary target of IP(6) for 
      both mRNA export and translation termination in vivo. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae 
      cells, the IP(6)-binding mutants recapitulate all of the mRNA export and translation 
      termination defects found in mutants depleted of IP(6). We conclude that Gle1 
      specifically binds IP(6) and that this interaction is required for the full 
      potentiation of Dbp5 ATPase activity during both mRNA export and translation 
      termination.

TI  - RNA helicase DDX19 stabilizes ribosomal elongation and termination complexes.
PG  - 1307-1318
LID - 10.1093/nar/gkw1239 [doi]
AB  - The human DEAD-box RNA-helicase DDX19 functions in mRNA export through the nuclear 
      pore complex. The yeast homolog of this protein, Dbp5, has been reported to 
      participate in translation termination. Using a reconstituted mammalian in vitro 
      translation system, we show that the human protein DDX19 is also important for 
      translation termination. It is associated with the fraction of translating 
      ribosomes. We show that DDX19 interacts with pre-termination complexes (preTCs) in a 
      nucleotide-dependent manner. Furthermore, DDX19 increases the efficiency of 
      termination complex (TC) formation and the peptide release in the presence of 
      eukaryotic release factors. Using the eRF1(AGQ) mutant protein or a non-hydrolysable 
      analog of GTP to inhibit subsequent peptidyl-tRNA hydrolysis, we reveal that the 
      activation of translation termination by DDX19 occurs during the stop codon 
      recognition. This activation is a result of DDX19 binding to preTC and a concomitant 
      stabilization of terminating ribosomes. Moreover, we show that DDX19 stabilizes 
      ribosome complexes with translation elongation factors eEF1 and eEF2. Taken 
      together, our findings reveal that the human RNA helicase DDX19 actively 
      participates in protein biosynthesis.

TI  - SON protein regulates GATA-2 through transcriptional control of the microRNA 
      23a~27a~24-2 cluster.
PG  - 5381-8
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M112.447227 [doi]
AB  - SON is a DNA- and RNA-binding protein localized in nuclear speckles. Although its 
      function in RNA splicing for effective cell cycle progression and genome stability 
      was recently unveiled, other mechanisms of SON functions remain unexplored. Here, we 
      report that SON regulates GATA-2, a key transcription factor involved in 
      hematopoietic stem cell maintenance and differentiation. SON is highly expressed in 
      undifferentiated hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells and leukemic blasts. SON 
      knockdown leads to significant depletion of GATA-2 protein with marginal 
      down-regulation of GATA-2 mRNA. We show that miR-27a is up-regulated upon SON 
      knockdown and targets the 3'-UTR of GATA-2 mRNA in hematopoietic cells. 
      Up-regulation of miR-27a was due to activation of the promoter of the 
      miR-23a∼27a∼24-2 cluster, suggesting that SON suppresses this promoter to lower the 
      microRNAs from this cluster. Our data revealed a previously unidentified role of SON 
      in microRNA production via regulating the transcription process, thereby modulating 
      GATA-2 at the protein level during hematopoietic differentiation.

TI  - The DEAD-box protein Dbp5p is required to dissociate Mex67p from exported mRNPs at 
      the nuclear rim.
PG  - 645-51
AB  - Eukaryotic mRNAs are exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm as complex 
      mRNA-protein particles (mRNPs), and translocation through the nuclear pore complex 
      (NPC) is accompanied by extensive structural changes of the mRNP. We have tested the 
      hypothesis that the DEAD-box ATPase Dbp5p is required for such an mRNP 
      rearrangement. In dbp5 mutant cells, the mRNA export receptor Mex67p accumulates on 
      mRNA. This aberrant accumulation of Mex67p with RNA and the cold-sensitive growth 
      phenotype of a dbp5 allele are suppressed by a mex67 mutation. Moreover, Mex67 bound 
      mRNA accumulates at the nuclear rim in a temperature-sensitive dbp5 mutant when the 
      nuclear exosome is impaired. Importantly, although accumulation of Mex67p-containing 
      mRNPs is also observed when a nuclear basket component is mutated, these mRNPs still 
      contain the nuclear export factor Yra1p. In contrast, the dbp5-trapped mRNPs lack 
      Yra1p. We propose that Dbp5p's function is specifically required to displace Mex67p 
      from exported mRNPs, thus terminating export.

TI  - Structural basis for polyadenosine-RNA binding by Nab2 Zn fingers and its function 
      in mRNA nuclear export.
PG  - 1007-18
LID - 10.1016/j.str.2012.03.011 [doi]
AB  - Polyadenylation regulation and efficient nuclear export of mature mRNPs both require 
      the polyadenosine-RNA-binding protein, Nab2, which contains seven CCCH Zn fingers. 
      We describe here the solution structure of fingers 5-7, which are necessary and 
      sufficient for high-affinity polyadenosine-RNA binding, and identify key residues 
      involved. These Zn fingers form a single structural unit. Structural coherence is 
      lost in the RNA-binding compromised Nab2-C437S mutant, which also suppresses the 
      rat8-2 allele of RNA helicase Dbp5. Structure-guided Nab2 variants indicate that 
      dbp5(rat8-2) suppression is more closely linked to hyperadenylation and suppression 
      of mutant alleles of the nuclear RNA export adaptor, Yra1, than to affinity for 
      polyadenosine-RNA. These results indicate that, in addition to modulating polyA tail 
      length, Nab2 has an unanticipated function associated with generating 
      export-competent mRNPs, and that changes within fingers 5-7 lead to suboptimal 
      assembly of mRNP export complexes that are more easily disassembled by Dbp5 upon 
      reaching the cytoplasm.

AB  - DEAD-box ATPases/helicases are a large family of enzymes (>35 in humans) involved in 
      almost all aspects of RNA metabolism including ribosome biogenesis, RNA splicing, 
      export, translation, and decay. Many members of this family are ATP-dependent 
      RNA-binding proteins that interact with the RNA phosphodiester backbone and promote 
      structural remodeling of target complexes through ATP binding and hydrolysis. Here, 
      we describe the methods used in our laboratory to characterize the DEAD-box ATPase 
      Dbp5 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Dbp5 is essential for the process of mRNA export 
      in budding yeast and highly conserved orthologs can be found in all eukaryotes. 
      Specifically, we describe enzyme assays to measure the catalytic activity of Dbp5 in 
      association with RNA and known binding partners, as well as assays developed to 
      measure the binding affinities and release kinetics of RNA and adenosine nucleotides 
      from Dbp5. These assays have provided important information that has shaped our 
      current models of Dbp5 function in mRNA export and should be useful for the 
      characterization of other DEAD-box family members.

TI  - The RNA export factor Mex67 functions as a mobile nucleoporin.
PG  - 3967-3976
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201909028 [doi]
AB  - The RNA export factor Mex67 is essential for the transport of mRNA through the 
      nuclear pore complex (NPC) in yeast, but the molecular mechanism of this export 
      process remains poorly understood. Here, we use quantitative fluorescence microscopy 
      techniques in live budding yeast cells to investigate how Mex67 facilitates mRNA 
      export. We show that Mex67 exhibits little interaction with mRNA in the nucleus and 
      localizes to the NPC independently of mRNA, occupying a set of binding sites offered 
      by FG repeats in the NPC. The ATPase Dbp5, which is thought to remove Mex67 from 
      transcripts, does not affect the interaction of Mex67 with the NPC. Strikingly, we 
      find that the essential function of Mex67 is spatially restricted to the NPC since a 
      fusion of Mex67 to the nucleoporin Nup116 rescues a deletion of MEX67 Thus, Mex67 
      functions as a mobile NPC component, which receives mRNA export substrates in the 
      central channel of the NPC to facilitate their translocation to the cytoplasm.

TI  - Observing phthalate leaching from plasticized polymer films at the molecular level.
PG  - 4933-44
LID - 10.1021/la500476u [doi]
AB  - Phthalates, the most widely used plasticizers in poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC), have 
      been extensively studied. In this paper, a highly sensitive, easy, and effective 
      method was developed to examine short-term phthalate leaching from PVC/phthalate 
      films at the molecular level using sum frequency generation vibrational spectroscopy 
      (SFG). Combining SFG and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), surface and 
      bulk molecular structures of PVC/phthalate films were also comprehensively evaluated 
      during the phthalate leaching process under various environments. The leaching 
      processes of two phthalates, diethyl phthalate (DEP) and dibutyl phthalate (DBP), 
      from the PVC/phthalate films with various weight ratios were studied. Oxygen plasma 
      was applied to treat the PVC/phthalate film surfaces to verify its efficacy on 
      preventing/reducing phthalate leaching from PVC. Our results show that DBP is more 
      stable than DEP in PVC/phthalate films. Even so, DBP molecules were still found to 
      very slowly leach to the environment from PVC at 30 °C, at a rate much slower than 
      DEP. Also, the bulk DBP content substantially influences the DBP leaching. Higher 
      DBP bulk concentration yields less stable DBP molecules in the PVC matrix, allowing 
      molecules to leach from the polymer film more easily. Additionally, DBP leaching is 
      very sensitive to temperature changes; higher temperature can strongly enhance the 
      leaching process. For most cases, the oxygen plasma treatment can effectively 
      prevent phthalate leaching from PVC films (e.g., for samples with low bulk 
      concentrations of DBP-5 and 30 wt %). It is also capable of reducing phthalate 
      leaching from high DBP bulk concentration PVC samples (e.g., 70 wt % DBP in PVC/DBP 
      mixture). This research develops a highly sensitive method to detect chemicals at 
      the molecular level as well as provides surface and bulk molecular structural 
      changes. The method developed here is general and can be applied to detect small 
      amounts of chemical/biological environmental contaminants.

TI  - Son maintains accurate splicing for a subset of human pre-mRNAs.
PG  - 4286-98
LID - 10.1242/jcs.092239 [doi]
AB  - Serine-arginine-rich (SR) proteins play a key role in alternative pre-mRNA splicing 
      in eukaryotes. We recently showed that a large SR protein called Son has unique 
      repeat motifs that are essential for maintaining the subnuclear organization of 
      pre-mRNA processing factors in nuclear speckles. Motif analysis of Son highlights 
      putative RNA interaction domains that suggest a direct role for Son in pre-mRNA 
      splicing. Here, we used in situ approaches to show that Son localizes to a reporter 
      minigene transcription site, and that RNAi-mediated Son depletion causes exon 
      skipping on reporter transcripts at this transcription site. A genome-wide exon 
      microarray analysis was performed to identify human transcription and splicing 
      targets of Son. Our data show that Son-regulated splicing encompasses all known 
      types of alternative splicing, the most common being alternative splicing of 
      cassette exons. We confirmed that knockdown of Son leads to exon skipping in 
      pre-mRNAs for chromatin-modifying enzymes, including ADA, HDAC6 and SetD8. This 
      study reports a comprehensive view of human transcription and splicing targets for 
      Son in fundamental cellular pathways such as integrin-mediated cell adhesion, cell 
      cycle regulation, cholesterol biosynthesis, apoptosis and epigenetic regulation of 
      gene expression.

TI  - Synthetic genetic array analysis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae provides evidence for 
      an interaction between RAT8/DBP5 and genes encoding P-body components.
PG  - 1945-55
LID - 10.1534/genetics.108.091256 [doi]
AB  - Coordination of the multiple steps of mRNA biogenesis helps to ensure proper 
      regulation of gene expression. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae DEAD-box protein 
      Rat8p/Dbp5p is an essential mRNA export factor that functions at the nuclear pore 
      complex (NPC) where it is thought to remodel mRNA/protein complexes during mRNA 
      export. Rat8p also functions in translation termination and has been implicated in 
      functioning during early transcription. We conducted a synthetic genetic array 
      analysis (SGA) using a strain harboring the temperature-sensitive rat8-2 allele. 
      Although RAT8 had been shown to interact genetically with >15 other genes, we 
      identified >40 additional genes whose disruption in a rat8-2 background causes 
      synthetic lethality or dramatically reduced growth. Included were five that encode 
      components of P-bodies, sites of cytoplasmic mRNA turnover and storage. Wild-type 
      Rat8p localizes to NPCs and diffusely throughout the cell but rat8-2p localized to 
      cytoplasmic granules at nonpermissive temperature that are distinct from P-bodies. 
      In some genetic backgrounds, these granules also contain poly(A)-binding protein, 
      Pab1p, and additional mRNA export factors. Although these foci are distinct from 
      P-bodies, the two merge under heat-stress conditions. We suggest that these granules 
      reflect defective mRNP remodeling during mRNA export and during cytoplasmic mRNA 
      metabolism.

TI  - A novel de novo frameshift variation in the SON gene causing severe global 
      developmental delay and seizures in a Chinese female.
LID - 10.1002/jdn.10170 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: With the rapid development of genetic detection technology, especially 
      next-generation sequencing, identification of the aetiology of unexplained 
      intellectual disabilities accompanied by seizures and other dysmorphic features has 
      become possible. The purpose of our paper is to make a definitive diagnosis of a 
      girl with neonatal hypotonia, severe global developmental delay, seizures and mild 
      facial dysmorphism. METHODS: The clinical data of the patient were retrospectively 
      studied. Whole-exome sequencing was performed on a blood sample from the patient. 
      Subsequently, Sanger sequencing was utilized for validation of variants and parental 
      validation. RESULTS: The patient had hypotonia since the neonatal period. She showed 
      a significant delay in physical and psychomotor development. She did not have any 
      speech until the age of 2 years and 6 months. She had seizures that were easy to 
      control with levetiracetam. The craniocerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) then 
      showed mild delayed myelination, enlarged bilateral ventricles and widened 
      frontotemporal extracerebral space. Interictal video electroencephalogram (VEEG) was 
      normal. She had esotropia and mild facial abnormalities with a flat nasal bridge and 
      a short nose. She showed no abnormalities in the heart, genitourinary or skeletal 
      systems. Whole-exome sequencing revealed a novel de novo variant c.5334_5335delAG 
      (p. Arg1778Serfs*11) in the SON gene. CONCLUSION: Our paper reports a novel variant 
      in the SON gene and provides a definitive diagnosis of a female with neonatal 
      hypotonia, severe global developmental delay, seizures and mild facial 
      abnormalities, which are symptoms consistent with Zhu-Tokita-Takenouchi-Kim syndrome 
      (ZTTK syndrome).

AB  - 3-(4-(Benzo[d]thiazol-2-yl)-1-phenyl-1H-pyrazol-3-yl) phenyl acetate (DPB-5) is a 
      synthetic benzothiazole derivative. In the present study, we revealed that DPB-5 had 
      strong cytotoxicity to induce cell apoptosis, which was mediated by ROS. And DPB-5 
      was more cytotoxic toward hepatoma cells than toward normal hepatic cells, which was 
      resulted from the greater susceptibility of the malignant cells to ROS. DBP-5 caused 
      massive ROS accumulation and GSH decrease, which lead to MMP disruption, caspase 
      activation and finally induced cell apoptosis. Additionally, rotenone, an inhibitor 
      of mitochondria electron transport system, effectively blocked the ROS elevated 
      effect of DPB-5, which suggested that DPB-5-induced ROS generated from the 
      mitochondria. Further studies showed that DPB-5-induced cell apoptosis through 
      caspases-cascade, but failed to activate caspase-9. Hence, we concluded that 
      DPB-5-induced Hep G2 cells apoptosis via a ROS-mediated pathway which was 
      caspase-dependent but did not rely on caspase-9.

PG  - 5978

AB  - Controlled transport of macromolecules between the cytoplasm and nucleus is 
      essential for homeostatic regulation of cellular functions. For instance, gene 
      expression entails coordinated nuclear import of transcriptional regulators to 
      activate transcription and nuclear export of the resulting messenger RNAs for 
      cytoplasmic translation. Here we link these two processes by reporting a novel role 
      for the mRNA export factor Ddx19/Dbp5 in nuclear import of MKL1, the 
      signal-responsive transcriptional activator of SRF. We show that Ddx19 is not a 
      general nuclear import factor, and that its specific effect on MKL1 nuclear import 
      is separate from its role in mRNA export. Both helicase and nuclear pore-binding 
      activities of Ddx19 are dispensable for MKL1 nuclear import, but RNA binding is 
      required. Mechanistically, Ddx19 operates by modulating the conformation of MKL1, 
      which affects its interaction with Importin-β for efficient nuclear import. Thus, 
      Ddx19 participates in mRNA export, translation and nuclear import of a key 
      transcriptional regulator.

TI  - Translation termination: new factors and insights.
PG  - 548-50
AB  - In eukaryotes, translation termination requires two eukaryotic release factors, eRF1 
      and eRF3. eRF1 is required for recognition of the stop codon and eRF3 supports the 
      polypeptide chain release in a GTP dependent manner. Recently, several new players 
      in translation termination have been identified. The DEAD-box RNA helicase Dbp5 has 
      been shown to support eRF1 in stop codon recognition, possibly by proper placement 
      of the release factor on the termination codon. Upon its dissociation from eRF1, 
      Dbp5 allows the entry of the second termination factor eRF3 into the complex. 
      Further, the Dbp5 interacting protein Gle1 and its co-factor inositol 
      hexakisphosphate (IP 6) have been shown to participate in the termination process. 
      Dbp5 and Gle1 are well known for their function in mRNA export from the nucleus to 
      the cytoplasm. Most interestingly, also the ATP binding cassette (ABC) protein Rli1, 
      which requires the mitochondrial and cytosolic Fe/S protein biogenesis machineries 
      for its assembly, has recently been shown to function in translation termination and 
      recycling of the ribosomes. Rli1 physically and genetically interacts with both, 
      eRF1 and eRF3. Together, all of these novel termination factors modulate in 
      association with the release factors more accurate stop codon recognition and these 
      findings broaden our knowledge about the final steps in translation.

AB  - Nuclear export of mRNA is a key transport process in eukaryotic cells. To 
      investigate it, we labeled native mRNP particles in living Chironomus tentans 
      salivary gland cells with fluorescent hrp36, the hnRNP A1 homolog, and the nuclear 
      envelope by fluorescent NTF2. Using light sheet microscopy, we traced single native 
      mRNA particles across the nuclear envelope. The particles were observed to often 
      probe nuclear pore complexes (NPC) at their nuclear face, and in only 25% of the 
      cases yielded actual export. The complete export process took between 65 ms up to 
      several seconds. A rate-limiting step was observed, which could be assigned to the 
      nuclear basket of the pore and might correspond to a repositioning and unfolding of 
      mRNPs before the actual translocation. Analysis of single fluorescent Dbp5 
      molecules, the RNA helicase essential for mRNA export, revealed that Dbp5 most often 
      approached the cytoplasmic face of the NPC, and exhibited a binding duration of 
      approximately 55 ms. Our results have allowed a refinement of the current models for 
      mRNA export.

AB  - The interphase nucleus is a highly ordered and compartmentalized organelle. Little 
      is known regarding what elaborate mechanisms might exist to explain these properties 
      of the nucleus. Also unresolved is whether some architectural components might 
      facilitate the formation of functional intranuclear compartments or higher order 
      chromatin structure. As the first step to address these questions, we performed an 
      in-depth proteome analysis of nuclear insoluble fractions of human HeLa-S3 cells 
      prepared by two different approaches: a high-salt/detergent/nuclease-resistant 
      fraction and a lithium 3,5-diiodosalicylate/nuclease-resistant fraction. Proteins of 
      the fractions were analyzed by liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem 
      mass spectrometry, identifying 333 and 330 proteins from each fraction respectively. 
      Among the insoluble nuclear proteins, we identified 37 hitherto unknown or 
      functionally uncharacterized proteins. The RNA recognition motif, WD40 repeats, HEAT 
      repeats and the SAP domain were often found in these identified proteins. The 
      subcellular distribution of selected proteins, including DEK protein and SON 
      protein, demonstrated their novel associations with nuclear insoluble materials, 
      corroborating our MS-based analysis. This study establishes a comprehensive catalog 
      of the nuclear insoluble proteins in human cells. Further functional analysis of the 
      proteins identified in our study will significantly improve our understanding of the 
      dynamic organization of the interphase nucleus.

TI  - SON controls cell-cycle progression by coordinated regulation of RNA splicing.
PG  - 185-98
LID - 10.1016/j.molcel.2011.03.014 [doi]
AB  - It has been suspected that cell-cycle progression might be functionally coupled with 
      RNA processing. However, little is known about the role of the precise splicing 
      control in cell-cycle progression. Here, we report that SON, a large Ser/Arg 
      (SR)-related protein, is a splicing cofactor contributing to efficient splicing of 
      cell-cycle regulators. Downregulation of SON leads to severe impairment of spindle 
      pole separation, microtubule dynamics, and genome integrity. These molecular defects 
      result from inadequate RNA splicing of a specific set of cell-cycle-related genes 
      that possess weak splice sites. Furthermore, we show that SON facilitates the 
      interaction of SR proteins with RNA polymerase II and other key spliceosome 
      components, suggesting its function in efficient cotranscriptional RNA processing. 
      These results reveal a mechanism for controlling cell-cycle progression through 
      SON-dependent constitutive splicing at suboptimal splice sites, with strong 
      implications for its role in cancer and other human diseases.

TI  - The DExH/D box protein HEL/UAP56 is essential for mRNA nuclear export in Drosophila.
PG  - 1716-21
AB  - Dbp5 is the only member of the DExH/D box family of RNA helicases that is directly 
      implicated in the export of messenger RNAs from the nucleus of yeast and vertebrate 
      cells. Dbp5 localizes in the cytoplasm and at the cytoplasmic face of the nuclear 
      pore complex (NPC). In an attempt to identify proteins present in a highly enriched 
      NPC fraction, two other helicases were detected: RNA helicase A (RHA) and UAP56. 
      This suggested a role for these proteins in nuclear transport. Contrary to 
      expectation, we show that the Drosophila homolog of Dbp5 is not essential for mRNA 
      export in cultured Schneider cells. In contrast, depletion of HEL, the Drosophila 
      homolog of UAP56, inhibits growth and results in a robust accumulation of 
      polyadenylated RNAs within the nucleus. Consequently, incorporation of 
      [35S]methionine into newly synthesized proteins is inhibited. This inhibition 
      affects the expression of both heat-shock and non-heat-shock mRNAs, as well as 
      intron-containing and intronless mRNAs. In HeLa nuclear extracts, UAP56 
      preferentially, but not exclusively, associates with spliced mRNAs carrying the exon 
      junction complex (EJC). We conclude that HEL is essential for the export of bulk 
      mRNA in Drosophila. The association of human UAP56 with spliced mRNAs suggests that 
      this protein might provide a functional link between splicing and export.

TI  - Organization and conservation of the GART/SON/DONSON locus in mouse and human 
      genomes.
PG  - 57-62
AB  - The SON gene, which maps to human chromosome 21q22.1-q22.2, encodes a novel 
      regulatory protein. Here we describe the organization of the Son locus in the mouse 
      genome. The mouse Son gene spans a region of approximately 35 kb. The coding region 
      is more than 8 kb in length and has been completely sequenced. The gene is organized 
      into 11 coding exons and 1 noncoding 3'UTR exon, with over 70% of the coding region 
      residing in one 5.7-kb exon. The gene contains at least one alternative exon, N/C 
      exon 1, which can be used, by splicing, to generate a truncated form of the SON 
      protein. Further investigation of the mouse Son locus has identified the genes 
      directly flanking Son. The glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase gene, Gart, 
      is encoded 5' of Son in a head-to-head arrangement, with the start of both genes 
      lying within 899 bp. Sequence comparison with the expressed sequence tagged database 
      identified a novel gene within 65 bp of the 3' end of Son, which we have named 
      Donson. In this unusually compact gene cluster, we have found overlap in the pattern 
      of expression between Gart, Son, and Donson. However, at least two of these genes 
      have very different functions. While GART is involved in purine biosynthesis, we 
      find that SON shows the characteristics of "SR- type" proteins, which are involved 
      in mRNA processing and gene expression.

TI  - Physical and genetic interactions link the yeast protein Zds1p with mRNA nuclear 
      export.
PG  - 9691-7
AB  - Eukaryotic gene expression requires the export of mRNA from the nucleus to the 
      cytoplasm. The DEAD box protein Dbp5p is an essential export factor conserved from 
      yeast to man. A fraction of Dbp5p forms a complex with nucleoporins of the 
      cytoplasmic filaments of the nuclear pore complex. Gfd1p was identified originally 
      as a multicopy suppressor of the rat8-2 ts allele of DBP5. Here we reported that 
      Dbp5p and Gfd1p interact with Zds1p, a protein previously identified as a multicopy 
      suppressor in several yeast genetic screens. By using the two-hybrid system, we 
      showed that Zds1p interacts in vivo with both Gfd1p and Dbp5p. In vitro binding 
      experiments revealed that Gfd1p and Dbp5p bind directly to the C-terminal part of 
      Zds1p. In addition, ZDS1 interacted genetically with mutant alleles of genes 
      encoding key factors in mRNA export, including DBP5 and MEX67. Furthermore, deletion 
      of ZDS1 or of both ZDS1 and the closely related ZDS2 exacerbated the poly(A)+ export 
      defects shown by dbp5-2 and mex67-5 mutants. We proposed that Zds1p associates with 
      the complex formed by Dbp5p, Gfd1p, and nucleoporins at the cytosolic fibrils of the 
      nuclear pore complex and is required for optimal mRNA export.

TI  - Vitamin-D binding protein does not enhance healing in rat bone defects: a pilot 
      study.
PG  - 3156-64
LID - 10.1007/s11999-009-0864-0 [doi]
AB  - Vitamin D-binding protein (DBP) has an anabolic effect on the skeleton and 
      reportedly enhances bone ingrowth. We used an in vivo critical bone defect model to 
      determine whether local administration of DBP promotes bone defect healing. We 
      created a 5-mm segmental bone defect in the radial shaft in a rat model. Forty-eight 
      rats were assigned to eight groups: local application of 1 microg, 5 microg, 10 
      microg, or 50 microg DBP (DBP-1, DBP-5, DBP-10, DBP-50), autogenous bone marrow 
      mononuclear cells with or without 10 microg DBP (BM-DBP-10, BM), 80 microg BMP-2 
      delivered in gelatin sponge (BMP-2), and the sham operated group. Radiographic 
      evaluation, histological stains, and epifluorescence microscopy were performed. 
      Grossly, all bone gaps of the BMP-2 group were solidly bridged by callus, while all 
      those in the sham operated group remained unhealed by 9 weeks. Only one specimen of 
      the BM-DBP-10 and DBP-50 groups and three specimens of the BM group were solidly 
      healed; pseudarthroses occurred in all of the other specimens. Histological study 
      and radiographs of the specimens showed similar results. We did not observe the 
      enhanced bone healing reported in a previous study.

TI  - SON connects the splicing-regulatory network with pluripotency in human embryonic 
      stem cells.
PG  - 1141-1152

AB  - Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) harbour the ability to undergo lineage-specific 
      differentiation into clinically relevant cell types. Transcription factors and 
      epigenetic modifiers are known to play important roles in the maintenance of 
      pluripotency of hESCs. However, little is known about regulation of pluripotency 
      through splicing. In this study, we identify the spliceosome-associated factor SON 
      as a factor essential for the maintenance of hESCs. Depletion of SON in hESCs 
      results in the loss of pluripotency and cell death. Using genome-wide RNA profiling, 
      we identified transcripts that are regulated by SON. Importantly, we confirmed that 
      SON regulates the proper splicing of transcripts encoding for pluripotency 
      regulators such as OCT4, PRDM14, E4F1 and MED24. Furthermore, we show that SON is 
      bound to these transcripts in vivo. In summary, we connect a splicing-regulatory 
      network for accurate transcript production to the maintenance of pluripotency and 
      self-renewal of hESCs.

TI  - Nuclear export of the yeast mRNA-binding protein Nab2 is linked to a direct 
      interaction with Gfd1 and to Gle1 function.
PG  - 35384-91
AB  - Nuclear export of mRNA is mediated by interactions between soluble factors and 
      nuclear pore complex (NPC) proteins. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Nab2 is an 
      essential RNA-binding protein that shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm. The 
      mechanism for trafficking of Nab2-bound mRNA through the NPC has not been defined. 
      Gle1 is also required for mRNA export, and Gle1 interactions with NPC proteins, the 
      RNA helicase Dbp5, and Gfd1 have been reported. Here we report that Nab2, Gfd1, and 
      Gle1 associate in a complex. By using immobilized recombinant Gfd1, Nab2 was 
      isolated from total yeast lysate. A similar biochemical assay with immobilized 
      recombinant Nab2 resulted in coisolation of Gfd1 and Gle1. A Nab2-Gfd1 complex was 
      also identified by coimmunoprecipitation from yeast lysates. In vitro binding assays 
      with recombinant proteins revealed a direct association between Nab2 and Gfd1, and 
      two-hybrid assays delineated Gfd1 binding to the N-terminal Nab2 domain. This 
      N-terminal Nab2 domain is distinct from its RNA binding domains suggesting Nab2 
      could bind Gfd1 and RNA simultaneously. As Nab2 export was blocked in a gle1 mutant 
      at the restrictive temperature, we propose a model wherein Gfd1 serves as a bridging 
      factor between Gle1 and Nab2-bound mRNA during export.

TI  - Transcription repression of human hepatitis B virus genes by negative regulatory 
      element-binding protein/SON.
PG  - 24059-67
AB  - A negative regulatory element (NRE) is located immediately upstream of the upstream 
      regulatory sequence of core promoter and second enhancer of human hepatitis B virus 
      (HBV). NRE represses the transcription activation function of the upstream 
      regulatory sequence of core promoter and the second enhancer. In this study, we 
      described the cloning and characterization of an NRE-binding protein (NREBP) through 
      expression cloning. NREBP cDNA is 8266 nucleotides in size and encodes a protein of 
      2386 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 262 kDa. Three previously 
      described cDNAs, DBP-5, SONB, and SONA, are partial sequence and/or alternatively 
      spliced forms of NREBP. The genomic locus of the NREBP/SON gene is composed of 13 
      exons and 12 introns. The endogenous NREBP protein is localized in the nucleus of 
      human hepatoma HuH-7 cells. Antibody against NREBP protein can specifically block 
      the NRE binding activity present in fractionated nuclear extracts in gel shifting 
      assays, indicating that NREBP is the endogenous nuclear protein that binds to NRE 
      sequence. By polymerase chain reaction-assisted binding site selection assay, we 
      determined that the consensus sequence for NREBP binding is GA(G/T)AN(C/G)(A/G)CC. 
      Overexpression of NREBP enhances the repression of the HBV core promoter activity 
      via NRE. Overexpression of NREBP can also repress the transcription of HBV genes and 
      the production of HBV virions in a transient transfection system that mimics the 
      viral infection in vivo.

TI  - Accurate splicing of HDAC6 pre-mRNA requires SON.
PG  - 5886-99
LID - 10.3390/ijms16035886 [doi]
AB  - Pre-mRNA splicing requires proper splice site selection mediated by many factors 
      including snRNPs and serine-arginine rich (SR) splicing factors. Our lab previously 
      reported that the SR-like protein SON maintains organization of pre-mRNA splicing 
      factors in nuclear speckles as well as splicing of many human transcripts including 
      mRNAs coding for the chromatin-modifying enzymes HDAC6, ADA and SETD8. However, the 
      mechanism by which SON maintains accurate splicing is unknown. To build tools for 
      understanding SON-dependent pre-mRNA splicing, we constructed a minigene reporter 
      plasmid driving expression of the genomic sequence spanning exons 26 through 29 of 
      HDAC6. Following SON depletion, we observed altered splicing of HDAC6 reporter 
      transcripts that showed exclusion of exons 27 and 28, reflecting the splicing 
      patterns of endogenous HDAC6 mRNA. Importantly, loss of HDAC6 biological function 
      was also observed, as indicated by truncated HDAC6 protein and corresponding absence 
      of aggresome assembly activities of HDAC6 binding-of-ubiquitin zinc finger (BUZ) 
      domain. We therefore propose that SON-mediated splicing regulation of HDAC6 is 
      essential for supporting protein degradation pathways that prevent human disease.

TI  - The mRNA export factor Gle1 and inositol hexakisphosphate regulate distinct stages 
      of translation.
PG  - 624-33
LID - 10.1016/j.cell.2008.06.027 [doi]
AB  - Gene expression requires proper messenger RNA (mRNA) export and translation. 
      However, the functional links between these consecutive steps have not been fully 
      defined. Gle1 is an essential, conserved mRNA export factor whose export function is 
      dependent on the small molecule inositol hexakisphosphate (IP(6)). Here, we show 
      that both Gle1 and IP(6) are required for efficient translation termination in 
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae and that Gle1 interacts with termination factors. In 
      addition, Gle1 has a conserved physical association with the initiation factor eIF3, 
      and gle1 mutants display genetic interactions with the eIF3 mutant nip1-1. 
      Strikingly, gle1 mutants have defects in initiation, whereas strains lacking IP(6) 
      do not. We propose that Gle1 functions together with IP(6) and the DEAD-box protein 
      Dbp5 to regulate termination. However, Gle1 also independently mediates initiation. 
      Thus, Gle1 is uniquely positioned to coordinate the mRNA export and translation 
      mechanisms. These results directly impact models for perturbation of Gle1 function 
      in pathophysiology.

TI  - [Regulation of insulin receptor expression and its gene].
PG  - 373-84
AB  - The insulin receptor is a membrane macromolecule whose expression on the cell 
      surface is essential for cell sensitivity to insulin. Current knowledge on the 
      regulation of expression of the insulin receptor and its gene in human and animal 
      cells is presented. Although ubiquitously distributed, the insulin receptor and its 
      messenger RNA (mRNA) are mainly expressed in metabolically active cells such as 
      hepatocytes and adipocytes. Two receptor isoforms, generated by alternative splicing 
      of exon 11, have been identified. Isoform B (exon 11+) predominates in liver and 
      adipocytes, and isoform A (exon 11-) in brain, spleen and leukocytes. In vivo and in 
      several cell models, the expression of the insulin receptor and/or its mRNA is under 
      positive regulation by glucocorticoid hormones and negative regulation by insulin. 
      Glucocorticoid hormones stimulate receptor gene transcription and receptor protein 
      synthesis. Insulin stimulates receptor protein degradation and, in certain cell 
      types, decreases receptor mRNA level. Vanadate (an insulinomimetic agent) corrects, 
      in vivo, the hyperexpression of the liver receptor observed in experimental 
      insulinopenic diabetes, but its effects on receptor expression in vitro are complex 
      and vary with the cell type. In vivo the insulin receptor and/or its mRNA are 
      expressed early in fetal development with a high level, in liver, of isoform A. 
      Maximal expression is reached at the end of gestation and then decreases after 
      birth. In several cell models, receptor protein and/or mRNA expression is affected 
      by cell growth and/or differentiation. Several cis- and trans-acting factors 
      regulating the expression of the human insulin receptor gene and its response to 
      glucocorticoid hormones have been identified.

TI  - A novel frameshift variant in SON causes Zhu-Tokita-Takenouchi-Kim Syndrome.
PG  - e23326
LID - 10.1002/jcla.23326 [doi]
LID - e23326
AB  - BACKGROUND: Zhu-Tokita-Takenouchi-Kim syndrome is a severe multisystem developmental 
      disorder characterized by intellectual disability, developmental delay, 
      malformations of the cerebral cortex, epilepsy, vision problems, musculoskeletal 
      abnormalities, and congenital malformations. This syndrome is caused by heterozygous 
      pathogenic variants in the SON gene at chromosome 21q22.1. OBJECTIVES: The aim of 
      this study was to investigate the pathogenesis of a 4-year-old Chinese child who 
      displayed severe intellectual disability, delayed psychomotor development, and 
      facial dysmorphism. METHODS: A sequential detection including chromosome 
      karyotyping, chromosome microarray analysis (CMA), and whole-exome sequencing (WES) 
      was performed on this child. The familial verification of WES result was conducted 
      by Sanger sequencing. RESULTS: A de novo frameshift variant SON: c.5230delC 
      (p.Arg1744ValfsTer29) was identified in the proband. The identical variant was not 
      found in his family members. The frequencies of this variant in gnomAD/gnomAD_EAS 
      databases were both none. CONCLUSIONS: This study substantiates that SON: c.5230delC 
      (p.Arg1744ValfsTer29) is a pathogenic variant of Zhu-Tokita-Takenouchi-Kim syndrome 
      and it is the first time to report Zhu-Tokita-Takenouchi-Kim syndrome in China.

TI  - Prediction of the coding sequences of unidentified human genes. XIV. The complete 
      sequences of 100 new cDNA clones from brain which code for large proteins in vitro.
PG  - 197-205
AB  - To extend our cDNA project for accumulating basic information on unidentified human 
      genes, we newly determined the sequences of 100 cDNA clones from a set of 
      size-fractionated human adult and fetal brain cDNA libraries, and predicted the 
      coding sequences of the corresponding genes, named KIAA1019 to KIAA1118. The 
      sequencing of these clones revealed that the average size of the inserts and 
      corresponding open reading frames were 5.0 kb and 2.6 kb (880 amino acid residues), 
      respectively. Database search of the predicted amino acid sequences classified 58 
      predicted gene products into the five functional categories, such as cell 
      signaling/communication, cell structure/motility, nucleic acid management, protein 
      management and cell division. It was also found that, for 34 gene products, 
      homologues were detected in the databases, which were similar in sequence through 
      almost the entire regions. The chromosomal locations of the genes were determined by 
      using human-rodent hybrid panels unless their mapping data were already available in 
      the public databases. The expression profiles of all the genes among 10 human 
      tissues, 8 brain regions (amygdala, corpus callosum, cerebellum, caudate nucleus, 
      hippocampus, substania nigra, subthalamic nucleus, and thalamus), spinal cord, fetal 
      brain and fetal liver were also examined by reverse transcription-coupled polymerase 
      chain reaction, products of which were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
      assay.

AB  - SON is a key component of the spliceosomal complex and a critical mediator of 
      constitutive and alternative splicing. Additionally, SON has been shown to influence 
      cell-cycle progression, genomic integrity, and maintenance of pluripotency in stem 
      cell populations. The clear functional relevance of SON in coordinating essential 
      cellular processes and its presence in diverse human tissues suggests that intact 
      SON might be crucial for normal growth and development. However, the phenotypic 
      effects of deleterious germline variants in SON have not been clearly defined. 
      Herein, we describe seven unrelated individuals with de novo variants in SON and 
      propose that deleterious variants in SON are associated with a severe multisystem 
      disorder characterized by developmental delay, persistent feeding difficulties, and 
      congenital malformations, including brain anomalies.

TI  - Whole-exome SNP array identifies 15 new susceptibility loci for psoriasis.

AB  - Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have reproducibly associated ∼40 
      susceptibility loci with psoriasis. However, the missing heritability is evident and 
      the contributions of coding variants have not yet been systematically evaluated. 
      Here, we present a large-scale whole-exome array analysis for psoriasis consisting 
      of 42,760 individuals. We discover 16 SNPs within 15 new genes/loci associated with 
      psoriasis, including C1orf141, ZNF683, TMC6, AIM2, IL1RL1, CASR, SON, ZFYVE16, 
      MTHFR, CCDC129, ZNF143, AP5B1, SYNE2, IFNGR2 and 3q26.2-q27 (P<5.00 × 10(-08)). In 
      addition, we also replicate four known susceptibility loci TNIP1, NFKBIA, IL12B and 
      LCE3D-LCE3E. These susceptibility variants identified in the current study 
      collectively account for 1.9% of the psoriasis heritability. The variant within AIM2 
      is predicted to impact protein structure. Our findings increase the number of 
      genetic risk factors for psoriasis and highlight new and plausible biological 
      pathways in psoriasis.

TI  - Mechanism of ATP turnover inhibition in the EJC.
PG  - 67-75
LID - 10.1261/rna.1283109 [doi]
AB  - The exon junction complex (EJC) is deposited onto spliced mRNAs and is involved in 
      many aspects of mRNA function. We have recently reconstituted and solved the crystal 
      structure of the EJC core made of MAGOH, Y14, the most conserved portion of MLN51, 
      and the DEAD-box ATPase eIF4AIII bound to RNA in the presence of an ATP analog. The 
      heterodimer MAGOH/Y14 inhibits ATP turnover by eIF4AIII, thereby trapping the EJC 
      core onto RNA, but the exact mechanism behind this remains unclear. Here, we present 
      the crystal structure of the EJC core bound to ADP-AIF(3), the first structure of a 
      DEAD-box helicase in the transition-mimicking state during ATP hydrolysis. It 
      reveals a dissociative transition state geometry and suggests that the locking of 
      the EJC onto the RNA by MAGOH/Y14 is not caused by preventing ATP hydrolysis. We 
      further show that ATP can be hydrolyzed inside the EJC, demonstrating that MAGOH/Y14 
      acts by locking the conformation of the EJC, so that the release of inorganic 
      phosphate, ADP, and RNA is prevented. Unifying features of ATP hydrolysis are 
      revealed by comparison of our structure with the EJC-ADPNP structure and other 
      helicases. The reconstitution of a transition state mimicking complex is not limited 
      to the EJC and eIF4AIII as we were also able to reconstitute the complex 
      Dbp5-RNA-ADP-AlF(3), suggesting that the use of ADP-AlF(3) may be a valuable tool 
      for examining DEAD-box ATPases in general.

TI  - Leukemia/lymphoma-related factor, a POZ domain-containing transcriptional repressor, 
      interacts with histone deacetylase-1 and inhibits cartilage oligomeric matrix 
      protein gene expression and chondrogenesis.
PG  - 47081-91
AB  - Mutations in the human cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) gene have been 
      linked to the development of pseudoachondroplasia and multiple epiphyseal dysplasia. 
      We previously cloned the promoter region of the COMP gene and delineated a minimal 
      negative regulatory element (NRE) that is both necessary and sufficient to repress 
      its promoter (Issack, P. S., Fang, C. H., Leslie, M. P., and Di Cesare, P. E. (2000) 
      J. Orthop. Res. 18, 345-350; Issack, P. S., Liu, C. J., Prazak, L., and Di Cesare, 
      P. E. (2004) J. Orthop. Res. 22, 751-758). In this study, a yeast one-hybrid screen 
      for proteins that associate with the NRE led to the identification of the 
      leukemia/lymphoma-related factor (LRF), a transcriptional repressor that contains a 
      POZ (poxvirus zinc finger) domain, as an NRE-binding protein. LRF bound directly to 
      the NRE both in vitro and in living cells. Nine nucleotides (GAGGGTCCC) in the 30-bp 
      NRE are essential for binding to LRF. LRF showed dose-dependent inhibition of 
      COMP-specific reporter gene activity, and exogenous overexpression of LRF repressed 
      COMP gene expression in both rat chondrosarcoma cells and bone morphogenetic 
      protein-2-treated C3H10T1/2 progenitor cells. In addition, LRF also inhibited bone 
      morphogenetic protein-2-induced chondrogenesis in high density micromass cultures of 
      C3H10T1/2 cells, as evidenced by lack of expression of other chondrocytic markers, 
      such as aggrecan and collagen types II, IX, X, and XI, and by Alcian blue staining. 
      LRF associated with histone deacetylase-1 (HDAC1), and experiments utilizing the 
      HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A revealed that LRF-mediated repression requires 
      deacetylase activity. LRF is the first transcription factor found to bind directly 
      to the COMP gene promoter, to recruit HDAC1, and to regulate both COMP gene 
      expression and chondrogenic differentiation.

TI  - Transcriptional activation of cartilage oligomeric matrix protein by Sox9, Sox5, and 
      Sox6 transcription factors and CBP/p300 coactivators.
PG  - 3899-910
AB  - The gene for cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) encodes a noncollagenous 
      matrix protein that is expressed predominantly in cartilage. COMP gene expression is 
      deficient in the Sox9-null mouse, but the molecular mechanism remains unknown. We 
      have previously delineated a 30-bp negative regulatory element (NRE) and a 51-bp 
      positive regulatory element (PRE) in the regulatory region of the COMP gene. 
      Subsequently we isolated LRF transcription repressor as an NRE-binding protein and 
      established that LRF inhibits COMP gene expression via recruiting histone 
      deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) to the COMP promoter. In this study we demonstrated that Sox9, 
      an essential transcription factor of chondrogenesis, binds to the COMP promoter at 
      the PRE in which 13 nucleotides (TGTTTACCTTGTG) are required for the binding of 
      Sox9. Sox9 activates COMP gene expression and this activation is PRE-dependent. Sox9 
      is required for COMP gene expression during chondrogenesis, since repression of Sox9 
      expression using the small interfering RNA approach inhibited COMP gene expression. 
      In addition, activation of COMP gene expression by Sox9 requires the participation 
      of transcription factors Sox5 and Sox6 as well as the coactivators CBP and p300 
      histone acetylase. It appears that there exists a balance between LRF repressor and 
      Sox9 activator in the control of COMP gene, since transactivation of COMP gene by 
      Sox9 was abolished by the coexpression of LRF, and excess Sox9 overcame the 
      LRF-mediated inhibition. This study provides the first evidence that Sox9 directly 
      associates with COMP gene promoter and that mediation of COMP gene activation by 
      Sox9 involves Sox5, Sox6, CBP, and p300 coactivators.

TI  - Constitutive silencing of IFN-beta promoter is mediated by NRF (NF-kappaB-repressing 
      factor), a nuclear inhibitor of NF-kappaB.
PG  - 6415-25
AB  - Transcriptional regulation of the interferon-beta (IFN-beta) gene is characterized 
      by strict constitutive repression and virus-specific activation. Previous studies 
      have shown that the IFN-beta promoter is constitutively repressed by a negative 
      regulatory element (NRE). Isolated NRE acts as a constitutive and 
      position-independent silencer on the NF-kappaB-binding sites. Here, we describe the 
      identification and functional characterization of the NRE-binding protein, called 
      NRF (NF-kappaB-repressing factor), which abolishes the transcriptional activity of 
      the bordering NF-kappaB- binding sites by a distance-independent mechanism. Deletion 
      studies show that a minimal repression domain of NRF is sufficient to exert its 
      inhibitory effect. In vitro, NF-kappaB proteins bind to purified NRF by a direct 
      protein-protein interaction. We demonstrate that NRF is a ubiquitous and 
      constitutive nuclear protein. In fibroblasts, the expression of the NRF antisense 
      RNA releases the endogenous IFN-beta gene transcription. Our data strongly suggest 
      that the NRF-mediated inhibition of NF-kappaB is a critical component of the 
      IFN-beta gene silencing prior to viral infection.

TI  - Disruption of the NHR4 domain structure in AML1-ETO abrogates SON binding and 
      promotes leukemogenesis.
PG  - 17103-8
LID - 10.1073/pnas.0802696105 [doi]
AB  - AML1-ETO is generated from t(8;21)(q22;q22), which is a common form of chromosomal 
      translocation associated with development of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Although 
      full-length AML1-ETO alone fails to promote leukemia because of its detrimental 
      effects on cell proliferation, an alternatively spliced isoform, AML1-ETO9a, without 
      its C-terminal NHR3/NHR4 domains, strongly induces leukemia. However, full-length 
      AML1-ETO is a major form of fusion product in many t(8;21) AML patients, suggesting 
      additional molecular mechanisms of t(8;21)-related leukemogenesis. Here, we report 
      that disruption of the zinc-chelating structure in the NHR4 domain of AML1-ETO by 
      replacing only one critical amino acid leads to rapid onset of leukemia, 
      demonstrating that the NHR4 domain with the intact structure generates inhibitory 
      effects on leukemogenesis. Furthermore, we identified SON, a DNA/RNA-binding domain 
      containing protein, as a novel NHR4-interacting protein. Knock-down of SON by siRNA 
      resulted in significant growth arrest, and disruption of the interaction between 
      AML1-ETO and endogenous SON rescued cells from AML1-ETO-induced growth arrest, 
      suggesting that SON is an indispensable factor for cell growth, and AML1-ETO binding 
      to SON may trigger signals inhibiting leukemogenesis. In t(8;21) AML patient-derived 
      primary leukemic cells and cell lines, abnormal cytoplasmic localization of SON was 
      detected, which may keep cells proliferating in the presence of full-length 
      AML1-ETO. These results uncovered the crucial role of the NHR4 domain in 
      determination of cellular fate during AML1-ETO-associated leukemogenesis.

TI  - Assortative weight gain in mother-daughter and father-son pairs: an emerging source 
      of childhood obesity. Longitudinal study of trios (EarlyBird 43).
PG  - 727-35
LID - 10.1038/ijo.2009.76 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To look for same-sex (gender assortative) association of body mass index 
      (BMI) in healthy trios (mother, father and child) from a contemporary birth cohort, 
      which might imply shared environment rather than shared genes because selective 
      mother-daughter and father-son gene transmission is not a common Mendelian trait. 
      DESIGN: Prospective (longitudinal) cohort study with four annual time points, from 5 
      to 8 years. SUBJECTS: 226 healthy trios from a 1995 to 1996 birth cohort randomly 
      selected in the city of Plymouth, UK. MEASUREMENTS: Average BMI of the two parents 
      and maternal/paternal BMI separately related to the BMI-SDS (standard deviation 
      score) of all offspring and to the BMI-SDS of the sons and the daughters separately. 
      RESULTS: There were big differences in BMI-SDS among the daughters grouped according 
      to mothers' category of BMI (effect size 1.37 SDS), but not their sons (effect size 
      0.16 SDS, gender interaction P<0.004), and among the sons grouped according to their 
      fathers' BMI (effect size 1.28 SDS), but not their daughters (effect size 0.17, 
      gender interaction P=0.02). Children whose same-sex parents were of normal weight, 
      weighed either close to (girls+0.20 BMI-SDS) or less than (boys,-0.34 BMI-SDS) 
      children of 20 years ago, and did not change from 5 to 8 years. In contrast, the 
      risks of obesity at 8 years were 10-fold greater (girls 41%, P<0.001) or sixfold 
      greater (boys 18%, P<0.05) if the same-sex parent was obese. Longitudinal linear 
      mixed effects (multilevel) modelling showed a marked influence of maternal and 
      paternal BMI on the rate of weight gain, which was unaffected by birth weight of the 
      child. We report perhaps the largest effect sizes so far recorded in childhood 
      obesity. CONCLUSIONS: Childhood obesity today seems to be largely confined to those 
      whose same-sex parents are obese, and the link does not seem to be genetic. Parental 
      obesity, like smoking, might be targeted in the interests of the child.

TI  - Dbp5p/Rat8p is a yeast nuclear pore-associated DEAD-box protein essential for RNA 
      export.
PG  - 2663-76
AB  - To identify Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes important for nucleocytoplasmic export of 
      messenger RNA, we screened mutant strains to identify those in which poly(A)+ RNA 
      accumulated in nuclei under nonpermissive conditions. We describe the identification 
      of DBP5 as the gene defective in the strain carrying the rat8-1 allele (RAT = 
      ribonucleic acid trafficking). Dbp5p/Rat8p, a previously uncharacterized member of 
      the DEAD-box family of proteins, is closely related to eukaryotic initiation factor 
      4A(eIF4A) an RNA helicase essential for protein synthesis initiation. Analysis of 
      protein databases suggests most eukaryotic genomes encode a DEAD-box protein that is 
      probably a homolog of yeast Dbp5p/Rat8p. Temperature-sensitive alleles of DBP5/RAT8 
      were prepared. In rat8 mutant strains, cells displayed rapid, synchronous 
      accumulation of poly(A)+ RNA in nuclei when shifted to the non-permissive 
      temperature. Dbp5p/Rat8p is located within the cytoplasm and concentrated in the 
      perinuclear region. Analysis of the distribution of Dbp5p/Rat8p in yeast strains 
      where nuclear pore complexes are tightly clustered indicated that a fraction of this 
      protein associates with nuclear pore complexes (NPCs). The strong mutant phenotype, 
      association of the protein with NPCs and genetic interaction with factors involved 
      in RNA export provide strong evidence that Dbp5p/Rat8p plays a direct role in RNA 
      export.

TI  - Physical and meiotic mapping of the region of human chromosome 4q11-q13 encompassing 
      the vitamin D binding protein DBP/Gc-globulin and albumin multigene cluster.
PG  - 581-7
AB  - The vitamin D binding protein/Gc-globulin (DBP) gene is a member of a multigene 
      cluster that includes albumin (ALB), alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), and 
      alpha-albumin/afamin (AFM). All four genes have structural and functional 
      similarities and map to the same chromosomal regions in humans (4q11-q13), mice, and 
      rats. An accurate physical map of the region encompassing these genes is a 
      prerequisite for study of their respective transcriptional regulation and 
      identification of potential shared regulatory elements. By refining the physical and 
      meiotic maps of the 4q11-q13 region and creating a local PAC contig, the order and 
      transcriptional orientations of these four genes were determined to be 
      centromere-3'-DBP-5'-5'-ALB-3'-5'-AFP-3'-5'-AFM3'-telomere. The ancestral DBP gene 
      was separated from the ALB gene by >1.5 Mb. This organization and spacing 
      establishes a foundation for ongoing functional studies in this region.

TI  - The helC gene encodes a putative DEAD-box RNA helicase required for development in 
      Dictyostelium discoideum.
PG  - 607-10
AB  - DEAD-box RNA helicases, defined by the sequence Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp (DEAD, in 
      single-letter amino-acid code), regulate RNA unwinding and secondary structure in an 
      ATP-dependent manner in vitro [1] and control mRNA stability and protein 
      translation. Both yeast and mammals have large families of DEAD-box proteins, many 
      of unknown function. We have disrupted a Dictyostelium discoideum gene, helC, which 
      encodes helicase C, a member of the DEAD-box family of RNA helicases that shows 
      strong homology to the product of the essential Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene dbp5 
      [2] and to related helicases in mouse and Schizosaccharomyces pombe. The HelC 
      protein also shows weaker homology to the translation initiation factor elF-4a. 
      Other DEAD-box-containing proteins, which are less closely related to HelC, have 
      been implicated in developmental roles in Drosophila [3] and Xenopus laevis; one 
      example is the Xenopus Vasa-like protein (XVLP) [4-6]. In Drosophila and Xenopus, 
      Vasa and XVLP, respectively, are required for the establishment of tissue polarity 
      during development. In yeast, DEAD-box helicases such as Prp8 [7] are components of 
      the spliceosome and connect pre-mRNA splicing with the cell cycle. Disruption of the 
      helC gene in D. discoideum led to developmental asynchrony, failure to differentiate 
      and aberrant morphogenesis. We postulate that one reason for the existence of large 
      families of homologous DEAD-box proteins in yeast, mammals and Dictyostelium could 
      be that some DEAD-box proteins have developmentally specific roles regulating 
      protein translation or mRNA stability.

AB  - Germline stem cells (GSCs) are attractive biological models because of their strict 
      control on pluripotency gene expression, and their potential for huge epigenetic 
      changes in a short period of time. Few data exists on the cooperative impact of 
      GSC-specific genes on differentiated cells. In this study, we over-expressed 3 
      GSC-specific markers, STELLA, OCT4 and NANOS2, collectively designated as (SON), 
      using the novel polycistronic lentiviral gene construct FUM-FD, in HEK293T cells and 
      evaluated promoter activity of the Stra8 GSC marker gene We could show that HEK293T 
      cells expressed pluripotency and GSC markers following ectopic expression of the SON 
      genes. We also found induction of pluripotency markers after serum starvation in 
      non-transduced HEK293T cells. Expression profiling of SON-expressing and 
      serum-starved cells at mRNA and protein level showed the potential of SON factors 
      and serum starvation in the induction of ESRRB, NANOG, OCT4 and REX1 expression. 
      Additionally, the data indicated that the mouse Stra8 promoter could only be 
      activated in a subpopulation of HEK293T cells, regardless of SON gene expression. We 
      conclude that heterogeneous population of the HEK293T cells might be easily shifted 
      towards expression of the pluripotency markers by ectopic expression of the SON 
      factors or by growth in serum depleted media.

TI  - Targeting of MAPK-associated molecules identifies SON as a prime target to attenuate 
      the proliferation and tumorigenicity of pancreatic cancer cells.
PG  - 88

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer is characterized by constitutive activation of 
      mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Activation of MAPK is associated with the 
      upregulation of genes implicated in the proliferation and survival of pancreatic 
      cancer cells. We hypothesized that knockdown of these MAPK-associated molecules 
      could produce notable anticancer phenotypes. METHODS: A RNA interference-mediated 
      knockdown screening of 78 MAPK-associated molecules previously identified was 
      performed to find molecules specifically associated with proliferation of pancreatic 
      cancer cells in vitro. Expression of an identified molecule in pancreatic cancer 
      tissues was examined by immunohistochemistry. In vivo tumorigenicity of cancer cells 
      with stable knockdown of the molecule was assayed by using xenograft models. Flow 
      cytometry and live cell imaging were employed to assess an association of the 
      molecule with cell cycle. RESULTS: The knockdown screening revealed that knockdown 
      of SON, the gene encoding SON, which is a large serine/arginine-rich protein 
      involved in RNA processing, substantially suppressed pancreatic cancer cell 
      proliferation and survival in vitro and tumorigenicity in vivo. SON expression was 
      higher in ductal adenocarcinomas than in cells of normal ducts and precursor lesions 
      in pancreatic cancer tissues. Knockdown of SON induced G2/M arrest and apoptosis in 
      cultured cancer cells. The suppressive effect of SON knockdown on proliferation was 
      less pronounced in cultured normal duct epithelial cells. SON formed nuclear 
      speckles in the interphase of the cell cycle and dispersed in the cytoplasm during 
      mitosis. Live cell imaging showed that SON diffusely dispersed in the early mitotic 
      phase, accumulated in some foci in the cytoplasm in the late mitotic phase, and 
      gradually reassembled into speckles after mitosis. CONCLUSION: These results 
      indicate that SON plays a critical role in the proliferation, survival, and 
      tumorigenicity of pancreatic cancer cells, suggesting that SON is a novel 
      therapeutic molecular target for pancreatic cancer.

TI  - SON is a spliceosome-associated factor required for mitotic progression.
PG  - 2679-85
LID - 10.4161/cc.9.13.12151 [doi]
AB  - The eukaryotic RNA splicing machinery is dedicated to the daunting task of excising 
      intronic sequences on the many nascent RNA transcripts in a cell, and in doing so 
      facilitates proper translation of its transcriptome. Notably, emerging evidence 
      suggests that RNA splicing may also play direct roles in maintaining genome 
      stability. Here we report the identification of the RNA/DNA-binding protein SON as a 
      component of spliceosome that plays pleiotropic roles during mitotic progression. We 
      found that SON is essential for cell proliferation, and that its inactivation 
      triggers a MAD2-dependent mitotic delay. Moreover, SON deficiency is accompanied by 
      defective chromosome congression, compromised chromosome segregation and 
      cytokinesis, which in turn contributes to cellular aneuploidy and cell death. In 
      summary, our study uncovers a specific link between SON and mitosis, and highlights 
      the potential of RNA processing as additional regulatory mechanisms that govern cell 
      proliferation and division.

TI  - Son of Notch, a winged-helix gene involved in boundary formation in the Drosophila 
      wing.
PG  - 781-90
AB  - A P element enhancer trap screen was conducted to identify genes involved in 
      dorsal-ventral boundary formation in Drosophila. The son of Notch (son) gene was 
      identified by the son(2205) enhancer trap insertion, which is a partial 
      loss-of-function mutation. Based on son(2205) mutant phenotypes and genetic 
      interactions with Notch and wingless mutations, we conclude that son participates in 
      wing development, and functions in the Notch signaling pathway at the dorsal-ventral 
      boundary in the wing. Notch signaling pathway components activate son enhancer trap 
      expression in wing cells. son enhancer trap expression is regulated positively by 
      wingless, and negatively by cut in boundary cells. Ectopic Son protein induces 
      wingless and cut expression in wing discs. We hypothesize that there is positive 
      feedback regulation of son by wingless, and negative regulation by cut at the 
      dorsal-ventral boundary during wing development.

TI  - A negative regulatory element (base pairs -204 to -177) of the EICP0 promoter of 
      equine herpesvirus 1 abolishes the EICP0 protein's trans-activation of its own 
      promoter.
PG  - 11696-706
AB  - The early EICP0 protein is a powerful trans-activator that activates all classes of 
      equine herpesvirus 1 (EHV-1) promoters but, unexpectedly, trans-activates its own 
      promoter very weakly. Transient transfection assays that employed constructs 
      harboring deletions within the EICP0 promoter indicated that EICP0 cis-acting 
      sequences within bp -224 to -158 relative to the first ATG abolished the EICP0 
      protein's trans-activation of its own promoter. When inserted into the promoters of 
      other EHV-1 genes, this sequence also downregulated activation of the 
      immediate-early IE(-169/+73), early thymidine kinase TK(-215/+97), and late 
      glycoprotein K gK(-83/+14) promoters, indicating that the cis-acting sequence (-224 
      to -158) downregulated expression of representative promoters of all classes of 
      EHV-1 genes and contains a negative regulatory element (NRE). To define the 
      cis-acting element(s), three synthetic oligonucleotides (Na [bp -224 to -195], Nb 
      [bp -204 to -177], and Nc [bp -185 to -156]) were synthesized and cloned upstream of 
      the EICP0(-157/-21) promoter. Of the three synthetic sequences, only the Nb 
      oligonucleotide caused the downregulation of the EICP0 promoter. The NRE was 
      identified as a 28-bp element to lie at -204 to -177 that encompassed the sequence 
      of ([-204]AGATACAGATGTTCGATAAATTGGAACC[-177]). Gel shift assays performed with mouse 
      L-M, rabbit RK-13, and human HeLa cell nuclear extracts and gamma-(32)P-labeled 
      wild-type and mutant NREs demonstrated that a ubiquitous nuclear protein(s) 
      (NRE-binding protein, NREBP) binds specifically to a sequence (bp -193 to -183) in 
      the NRE. The NREBP is also present in the nucleus of EHV-1-infected cells; however, 
      the amount of NREBP in EHV-1-infected L-M cells that bound to the Nb oligonucleotide 
      was reduced compared to that in uninfected L-M cells. Transient transfection assays 
      showed that deletions or mutations within the NREBP-binding site abolished the NRE 
      activity of the EICP0 promoter. These results suggested that the NREBP may mediate 
      the NRE activity of the EICP0 promoter and may function in the coordinate expression 
      of EHV-1 genes.

TI  - Cytoplasmic inositol hexakisphosphate production is sufficient for mediating the

PG  - 51022-32
AB  - Production of inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) by Ipk1, the 
      inositol-1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate 2-kinase, is required for Gle1-mediated mRNA 
      export in Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells. To examine the network of interactions 
      that require IP6 production, an analysis of fitness defects was conducted in mutants 
      harboring both an ipk1 null allele and a mutant allele in genes encoding 
      nucleoporins or transport factors. Enhanced lethality was observed with a specific 
      subset of mutants, including nup42, nup116, nup159, dbp5, and gle2, all of which had 
      been previously connected to Gle1 function. Complementation of the 
      nup116Deltaipk1Delta and nup42Deltaipk1Delta double mutants did not require the 
      Phe-Gly repeat domains in the respective nucleoporins, suggesting that IP6 was 
      acting subsequent to heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein targeting to the 
      nuclear pore complex. With Nup42 and Nup159 localized exclusively to the nuclear 
      pore complex cytoplasmic side, we speculated that IP6 may regulate a cytoplasmic 
      step in mRNA export. To test this prediction, the spatial requirements for the 
      production of IP6 were investigated. Restriction of Ipk1 to the cytoplasm did not 
      block IP6 production. Moreover, coincident sequestering of both Ipk1 and Mss4 (an 
      enzyme required for phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate production) to the 
      cytoplasm also did not block IP6 production. Given that the kinase required for 
      inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate production (Ipk2) is localized in the nucleus, 
      these results indicated that soluble inositides were diffusing between the nucleus 
      and the cytoplasm. Additionally, the cytoplasmic production of IP6 by plasma 
      membrane-anchored Ipk1 rescued a gle1-2 ipk1-4 synthetic lethal mutant. Thus, 
      cytoplasmic IP6 production is sufficient for mediating the Gle1-mRNA export pathway.

AB  - Zhu-Tokita-Takenouchi-Kim (ZTTK) syndrome is a rare, severe, and recently described 
      multisystem developmental disorder characterized by delayed psychomotor development 
      and intellectual disability, characteristic facial features, hypotonia, poor overall 
      growth, and visual abnormalities. Mucocutaneous manifestations have not been 
      reported so far among individuals with ZTTK syndrome. Herein, we present a patient 
      with ZTTK syndrome due to a de novo mutation in SON gene, who has dental 
      abnormalities and retronychia of the toenails. We suggest that mucocutaneous 
      features may be a part of the phenotype.

TI  - An early function during transcription for the yeast mRNA export factor Dbp5p/Rat8p 
      suggested by its genetic and physical interactions with transcription factor IIH 
      components.
PG  - 1664-76
AB  - The yeast DEAD-box protein Dbp5p/Rat8p is an essential factor for mRNA export and 
      shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. It is concentrated at the 
      cytoplasmic fibrils of the nuclear pore complex where it interacts with several 
      nucleoporins. On the basis of this localization, it has been suggested that it might 
      participate in a terminal step of RNA export, the release from the mRNA of proteins 
      that accompany the mRNA during translocation through nuclear pores. In this report, 
      we present evidence linking Dbp5p to transcription. Two different screens identified 
      genetic interactions between DBP5 and genes involved in early transcription events, 
      initiation and promoter clearance. Mutations of transcription proteins expected to 
      impair transcription act as suppressors of dbp5 mutants, whereas those that may act 
      to increase transcription are synthetically lethal with dbp5 mutations. We also show 
      that growth and mRNA export in dbp5 mutant strains are dependent on the 
      carboxy-terminal domain of the RNA pol II largest subunit. Finally, we show that 
      Dbp5p associates physically with components of transcription factor IIH. Because 
      these interactions affect not only growth but also mRNA export, they are likely to 
      reflect a functional relationship between Dbp5p and the transcription machinery. 
      Together, our results suggest a nuclear role for Dbp5 during the early steps of 
      transcription.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Zhu-Tokita-Takenouchi-Kim (ZTTK, OMIM# 617140) syndrome is a rare, 
      autosomal dominant genetic disorder caused by heterozygous variants in the SON gene 
      (OMIM#182465, GenBank#NC_000021.9). There are only 33 cases and 26 causative SON 
      variants reported to date since the first report in 2015. Here, we report a new case 
      of ZTTK syndrome and a de novo disease-causing SON variant. METHODS: We conducted 
      whole-exome sequencing (WES) to obtain genetic data of the patient. The clinical and 
      genetic data of the patient were analyzed. RESULTS: The clinical features of our 
      patient were strikingly similar to previously reported cases. Notably, our patient 
      had unique presentations, including a bridged palmar crease in the left hand and 
      growth hormone deficiency. The c.5297del de novo variant in SON causes an amino 
      change (p.Ser1766Leufs*7). CONCLUSION: Our report expands the mutant spectrum of the 
      SON gene and refines the genotype-phenotype map of ZTTK syndrome. Our findings also 
      highlighted the importance of WES for early diagnosis of ZTTK syndrome, which may 
      improve diagnostic procedures for affected individuals.

TI  - [Identification of non-receptor estrogen-binding protein in the ovarian cytosol of 
      sexually immature rats].
PG  - 61-5
AB  - The authors compared the properties of nonreceptor estrogen-binding protein (NREBP) 
      of the ovaries of immature rats, specific estrogen-binding protein (SEBP) of the 
      liver and alpha-fetoprotein (alpha-FP) of the rat blood serum. It was shown that all 
      3 proteins with moderate affinity bound 3H-estradiol (Ka approximately 10(8)M-1) and 
      were characterized by a high rate of interaction with ligand (K+1 approximately 
      10(6)M-1c-1) and dissociation of hormone-protein complexes (K-1 approximately 
      10(-2)c-1). NREBP and alpha-FP manifested a very close hormonal specificity of 
      affinity differing from SEBP specificity: both proteins bound intensively estrone 
      and estradiol, to a lesser degree, estriol, and did not bind androgens and 
      hexestrol. Stokes' radii of the molecules of 3 proteins were 4.4 and 2.5 nm, 
      respectively. Rabbit antiserum to alpha-FP suppressed the hormone-binding activity 
      of blood alpha-FP and ovarian NREBP but not liver SEBP. With growth of animals a 
      study of the time course of the levels of ovarian NREBP and blood alpha-FP has shown 
      that the presence of NREBP in the ovarian cytosol does not probably result from 
      blood proteins mechanical contamination of the sample in homogenization. It has been 
      assumed that intracellular alpha-FP or its close analog may be involved in the 
      regulation of ovarian endocrine function, reversibly binding estrogens.

TI  - Mutated SON putatively causes a cancer syndrome comprising high-risk medulloblastoma 
      combined with café-au-lait spots.
PG  - 353-358

AB  - Medulloblastoma is the most frequent malignant brain tumor in childhood. This highly 
      malignant neoplasm occurs usually before 10 years of age and more frequently in 
      boys. The 5-year event-free survival rate for high-risk medulloblastoma is low at 
      62% despite a multimodal therapy including surgical resection, radiation therapy and 
      chemotherapy. We report the case of a boy, who was born to consanguineous parents. 
      Prominently, he had multiple café-au-lait spots. At the age of 3 years he was 
      diagnosed with a high-risk metastatic medulloblastoma. The patient died only 
      11 months after diagnosis of a fulminant relapse presenting as meningeal and spinal 
      dissemination. Whole-exome sequencing of germline DNA was employed to detect the 
      underlying mutation for this putative cancer syndrome presenting with the 
      combination of medulloblastoma and skin alterations. After screening all possible 
      homozygous gene SNVs, we identified a mutation of SON, an essential protein in cell 
      cycle regulation and cell proliferation, as the most likely genetic cause.

TI  - Imaging within single NPCs reveals NXF1's role in mRNA export on the cytoplasmic 
      side of the pore.
PG  - 2962-2981
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201901127 [doi]
AB  - Translocation of mRNA through the nuclear pore complex (NPC) requires interactions 
      with different NPC regions. To determine the interactions that are crucial for 
      effective mRNA export in living cells, we examined mRNA export within individual 
      pores by applying various types of mRNA export blocks that stalled mRNPs at 
      different stages of transition. Focusing on the major mRNA export factor NXF1, we 
      found that initial mRNP binding to the NPC did not require NXF1 in the NPC, whereas 
      release into the cytoplasm did. NXF1 localization in the NPC did not require RNA or 
      RNA binding. Superresolution microscopy showed that NXF1 consistently occupied 
      positions on the cytoplasmic side of the NPC. Interactions with specific 
      nucleoporins were pinpointed using FLIM-FRET for measuring protein-protein 
      interactions inside single NPCs, showing that Dbp5 helicase activity of mRNA release 
      is conserved in yeast and humans. Altogether, we find that specific interactions on 
      the cytoplasmic side of the NPC are fundamental for the directional flow of mRNA 
      export.

TI  - The SON gene encodes a conserved DNA binding protein mapping to human chromosome 21.
PG  - 25-34
AB  - We report the identification and characterization of a clone for the DNA binding 
      protein SON, which we have isolated from a human keratinocyte cDNA library. Using 
      this clone we have found that the SON gene is expressed in different cell types and 
      that homologous sequences can be detected in vertebrate and insect genomic DNA. 
      Using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify SON sequences from a panel of 
      somatic cell hybrids we have assigned the gene encoding human SON to chromosome 21. 
      By use of hybrids containing regions of chromosome 21 the localization has been 
      refined to 21q 22.1-q22.2.

TI  - A genomic glance at the components of the mRNA export machinery in Plasmodium 
      falciparum.
PG  - 318-26
AB  - Nuclear export of mRNAs is one of the steps critically important for gene expression 
      and different steps of mRNA processing are linked to the export of the mRNA out of 
      the nucleus. This coupling probably provides a quality control mechanism as well as 
      a higher efficiency for the synthesis of mRNAs. The mRNA is synthesized in the 
      nucleus and then exported to the cytoplasm through the nuclear pore complexes 
      (NPCs), which are embedded in the nuclear envelope. The Mex67-Mtr2 complex in yeast 
      and its counterpart Tap-p15 in higher eukaryotes function as an mRNA exporter 
      through the NPC. Some of the DEAD box proteins such as UAP56 and Dbp5 have been 
      implicated in mRNA export also. In this report using the bioinformatics approach we 
      have analyzed the components of the mRNA export machinery in Plasmodium falciparum 
      and also highlighted the salient features of some of the components. Further 
      detailed studies on various components of nuclear mRNA export in Plasmodium 
      falciparum will be essential to understand this important pathway.

TI  - Crystal structure of the human eIF4AIII-CWC22 complex shows how a DEAD-box protein 
      is inhibited by a MIF4G domain.
PG  - E4611-8
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1314684110 [doi]
AB  - DEAD-box proteins are involved in all aspects of RNA processing. They bind RNA in an 
      ATP-dependent manner and couple ATP hydrolysis to structural and compositional 
      rearrangements of ribonucleoprotein particles. Conformational control is a major 
      point of regulation for DEAD-box proteins to act on appropriate substrates and in a 
      timely manner in vivo. Binding partners containing a middle domain of translation 
      initiation factor 4G (MIF4G) are emerging as important regulators. Well-known 
      examples are eIF4G and Gle1, which bind and activate the DEAD-box proteins eIF4A and 
      Dbp5. Here, we report the mechanism of an inhibiting MIF4G domain. We determined the 
      2.0-Å resolution structure of the complex of human eIF4AIII and the MIF4G domain of 
      the splicing factor Complexed With Cef1 (CWC22), an essential prerequisite for exon 
      junction complex assembly by the splicing machinery. The CWC22 MIF4G domain binds 
      both RecA domains of eIF4AIII. The mode of RecA2 recognition is similar to that 
      observed in the activating complexes, yet is specific for eIF4AIII. The way the 
      CWC22 MIF4G domain latches on the eIF4AIII RecA1 domain is markedly different from 
      activating complexes. In the CWC22-eIF4AIII complex, the RNA-binding and ATP-binding 
      motifs of the two RecA domains do not face each other, as would be required in the 
      active state, but are in diametrically opposite positions. The binding mode of CWC22 
      to eIF4AIII reveals a facet of how MIF4G domains use their versatile structural 
      frameworks to activate or inhibit DEAD-box proteins.

TI  - [The human son gene: the large and small transcripts contains various 5'-terminal 
      sequences].
PG  - 807-12
AB  - Human son gene was previously identified by cloning and hybridization to GC-rich rat 
      genomic fragment. After several cycles of human placenta library walking we were 
      able to identify and clone two alternative transcripts of this gene. Recently we 
      have determined nucleotide sequence of small son gene transcript, coding region of 
      which contains four areas of complete tandem repeats. Here we report the structure 
      of the part (2.9 kb) of large transcript of son gene from close to its 5'-end to the 
      end of sequence, unique for this transcript. Comparison of nucleotide sequences of 
      two transcripts indicates that they have common 3'-ends and, probably, arise from 
      alternative splicing. 5' proximal part of large transcript contains two areas of 
      complete tandem repeats not present in small transcript. Results of analysis of this 
      area support our model for forming son gene tandem repeats structure by duplication, 
      mutation and natural selection at the protein level.

TI  - The GLFG regions of Nup116p and Nup100p serve as binding sites for both Kap95p and 
      Mex67p at the nuclear pore complex.
PG  - 6445-52
AB  - Our previous studies have focused on a family of Saccharomyces cerevisiae nuclear 
      pore complex (NPC) proteins that contain domains composed of repetitive tetrapeptide 
      glycine-leucine-phenylalanine-glycine (GLFG) motifs. We have previously shown that 
      the GLFG regions of Nup116p and Nup100p directly bind the karyopherin transport 
      factor Kap95p during nuclear protein import. In this report, we have further 
      investigated potential roles for the GLFG region in mRNA export. The subcellular 
      localizations of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged mRNA transport factors were 
      individually examined in yeast cells overexpressing the Nup116-GLFG region. The 
      essential mRNA export factors Mex67-GFP, Mtr2-GFP, and Dbp5-GFP accumulated in the 
      nucleus. In contrast, the localizations of Gle1-GFP and Gle2-GFP remained 
      predominantly associated with the NPC, as in wild type cells. The localization of 
      Kap95p was also not perturbed with GLFG overexpression. Coimmunoprecipitation 
      experiments from yeast cell lysates resulted in the isolation of a Mex67p-Nup116p 
      complex. Soluble binding assays with bacterially expressed recombinant proteins 
      confirmed a direct interaction between Mex67p and the Nup116-GLFG or Nup100-GLFG 
      regions. Mtr2p was not required for in vitro binding of Mex67p to the GLFG region. 
      To map the Nup116-GLFG subregion(s) required for Kap95p and/or Mex67p association, 
      yeast two-hybrid analysis was used. Of the 33 Nup116-GLFG repeats that compose the 
      domain, a central subregion of nine GLFG repeats was sufficient for binding either 
      Kap95p or Mex67p. Interestingly, the first 12 repeats from the full-length region 
      only had a positive interaction with Mex67p, whereas the last 12 were only positive 
      with Kap95p. Thus, the GLFG domain may have the capacity to bind both karyopherins 
      and an mRNA export factor simultaneously. Taken together, our in vivo and in vitro 
      results define an essential role for a direct Mex67p-GLFG interaction during mRNA 
      export.

TI  - Phenotypic expansion in Zhu-Tokita-Takenouchi-Kim syndrome caused by de novo 
      variants in the SON gene.
PG  - e1432
LID - 10.1002/mgg3.1432 [doi]
LID - e1432
AB  - BACKGROUND: The genetic etiology of intellectual and psychomotor disability without 
      a defined spectrum of dysmorphic features is usually monogenic. As no diagnostic 
      criteria for such diseases are established, the clinical diagnosis becomes to be a 
      challenge. The object of our paper is to present two patients with non-specific 
      clinical symptoms for whom whole-exome-sequencing identified the new SON mutations 
      and thus allowed for establishing the diagnosis of Zhu-Tokita-Takenouchi-Kim (ZTTK) 
      syndrome. In both patients, the same symptoms including hypotonia, developmental and 
      speech delay, feeding difficulties as well as frequent infections of the respiratory 
      tract and internal ear were observed. However, both cases presented also with 
      exceptional symptoms such as in case 1 ventriculomegaly and asymmetry of ventricles, 
      hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS), intellectual disability, intestinal 
      malrotation, gastroparesis, and duodenal atresia and in the case 2 febrile seizures 
      and reduced IgA levels. We will be presenting the patients and comparing them to 30 
      previously described cases. METHODS: Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed on 
      the probands' DNA and paired-end sequenced (2x100 bp) on HiSeq 1500. Variants 
      considered as disease-causing were validated in the proband and studied in all 
      available family members by amplicon deep sequencing performed using Nextera XT Kit 
      and sequenced on HiSeq 1500. RESULTS: We have identified two new variants in SON 
      gene. In case 1 it has been a heterozygous frameshift variant p.(Ala1340GlnfsTer26), 
      while in case 2 it has been a heterozygous frameshift variant, p.(Asp1640GlyfsTer7). 
      Both variants are described for the first time and up to now, are not mentioned in 
      any database. CONCLUSION: As there are no precise criteria established for the 
      clinical diagnosis of ZTTK, an identification of SON gene mutation by 
      whole-exome-sequencing is the best method that allows for a diagnosis of this 
      syndrome.

TI  - Analysis of the antibody repertoire of astrocytoma patients against antigens 
      expressed by gliomas.
PG  - 73-7
AB  - The molecular characterization of antigens preferentially or exclusively expressed 
      by astrocytomas and recognized by the autologous immune system are a prerequisite 
      for the development of specific vaccines. To identify such antigens, we screened 5 
      cDNA expression libraries derived from astrocytomas and other gliomas for reactivity 
      with high-titered IgG antibodies in the sera of astrocytoma patients using SEREX, 
      the serologic identification of antigens by recombinant cDNA expression cloning. 
      Autologous and allogeneic SEREX analysis of >5 x 10(6) clones with the sera of 18 
      astrocytoma patients revealed 10 antigens: the differentiation antigen glial 
      fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), Bax-inhibitor 1 (which was overexpressed in all 
      glioma samples tested), 3 other molecules involved in the regulation of gene 
      expression and proliferation (the nm23-H2-encoded nucleoside diphosphate kinase B, 
      the Ran binding protein-2 and a DNA binding protein encoded by the son gene), 
      SP40,40 (a complement inhibitory molecule), the chaperonin TCP-1, calnexin and 2 new 
      gene products. No immune responses were detected against the "shared tumor" or 
      "cancer testis antigens" that are regularly expressed in gliomas. Antibody responses 
      in astrocytoma patients against antigens expressed by gliomas were rare and, with 
      the exception of Bax-inhibitor 1 and the product of the son gene, were also found in 
      apparently healthy controls. We conclude that although astrocytomas express a broad 
      spectrum of antigens, they elicit antibody responses only rarely, most likely 
      because of their intrinsic immunosuppressive effects.

TI  - A redundant nuclear protein binding site contributes to negative regulation of the 
      mouse mammary tumor virus long terminal repeat.
PG  - 7868-76
AB  - The tissue specificity of mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) expression is controlled 
      by regulatory elements in the MMTV long terminal repeat (LTR). These regulatory 
      elements include the hormone response element, located approximately between -200 
      and -75, as well as binding sites for NF-1, Oct-1 (OTF-1), and mammary gland 
      enhancer factors. Naturally occurring MMTV deletion variants isolated from T-cell 
      and kidney tumors, transgenic-mouse experiments with MMTV LTR deletions, and 
      transient transfection assays with LTR constructs indicate that there are additional 
      transcription regulatory elements, including a negative regulatory element (NRE), 
      located upstream of the hormone response element. To further define this regulatory 
      region, we have constructed a series of BAL 31 deletion mutants in the MMTV LTR for 
      use in transient transfection assays. These assays indicated that deletion of two 
      regions (referred to as promoter-distal and -proximal NREs) between -637 and -201 
      elevated basal MMTV promoter activity in the absence of glucocorticoids. The region 
      between -637 and -264 was surveyed for the presence of nuclear protein binding sites 
      by gel retardation assays. Only one type of protein complex (referred to as 
      NRE-binding protein or NBP) bound exclusively to sites that mapped to the 
      promoter-distal and -proximal NREs identified by BAL 31 mutations. The 
      promoter-proximal binding site was mapped further by linker substitution mutations 
      and transfection assays. Mutations that mapped to a region containing an inverted 
      repeat beginning at -287 relative to the start of transcription elevated basal 
      expression of a reporter gene driven by the MMTV LTR. A 59-bp DNA fragment from the 
      distal NRE also bound the NBP complex. Gel retardation assays showed that mutations 
      within both inverted repeats of the proximal NRE eliminated NBP binding and 
      mutations within single repeats altered NBP binding. Intriguingly, the NBP complex 
      was detected in extracts from T cells and lung cells but was absent from mammary 
      gland cells. These results suggest that a factor contributing to high-level 
      expression of MMTV in the mammary gland is the lack of negative regulation by NBP.

AB  - The role of RNA splicing in the regulation of stem cell properties has remained 
      largely unexplored. The splicing-associated protein SON is now shown to be necessary 
      for embryonic stem cell maintenance, by influencing the splicing of pluripotency 
      regulators.

TI  - Establishing SON in 21q22.11 as a cause a new syndromic form of intellectual 
      disability: Possible contribution to Braddock-Carey syndrome phenotype.
PG  - 2587-90
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.a.37761 [doi]
AB  - A recent study of exome analyses in 109 patients with undiagnosed diseases included 
      a 5-year-old girl with intellectual disability and multiple congenital anomalies, 
      who had an apparently de novo frameshift mutation in SON. However, the combination 
      of the truncating mutation in SON and the phenotype has not been reproduced until 
      date, and it remains unclear if this combination represents a distinctive disease 
      entity. Here we report an additional male with intellectual disability, congenital 
      heart disease, distinctive facial features with curly hair and protruding ears, and 
      long slender extremities, and hyperextensible joints. Exome analysis showed that he 
      had the same de novo frameshift mutation in SON in a heterozygous state. Along with 
      the first and original description of the apparently de novo truncating mutation in 
      SON mentioned above, we have established that haploinsufficiency of SON causes a new 
      recognizable syndrome of intellectual disability. SON is located within 21q22.11, a 
      critical region for Braddock-Carey syndrome, which is characterized by congenital 
      thrombocytopenia, intellectual disability, micrognathia, and a distinctive facies. 
      Therefore, we suggest that the intellectual disability observed in Braddock-Carey 
      syndrome could be accounted for by haploinsufficiency of SON. © 2016 Wiley

TI  - [The evidence for higher blood pressures in children and adolescents of the rural 
      interior of Galicia than in other locations in Spain].
PG  - 823-31
AB  - AIM: To analyze differences in blood pressure levels in children and adolescents in 
      Galicia with those of peers living in other parts of Spain. DESIGN: Cross-sectional 
      study done in a rural area in Galicia. PARTICIPANTS: 870 boys and girls 6 to 16 
      years old. They are compared with published data from the RICARDIN study, that 
      includes 10,042 participants selected at the schools in nine centers of Spain (one 
      was the center in Galicia). MEASUREMENTS: Standardized methodology and certification 
      procedures were used in Galicia and Spain to measure weight, height, Quételet index, 
      systolic (SBP) and fifth-phase diastolic blood pressure (DBP5) and sexual 
      maturation. Data are presented by sex and age group (1 year) both in Galicia and 
      Spain. RESULTS: From 11 years and above, girls in Galicia present higher SBP than in 
      Spain. In boys, the difference appears later. Galicia shows higher DBP5 levels than 
      Spain in every age-sex group. In relation to obesity, the differences are of a small 
      magnitude in the Quételet index, again, higher values in Galicia. CONCLUSIONS: This 
      is the first population-based study available that rules out the possibility that 
      the observed differences, previously already suggested, could be attributed to 
      methodological problems. The differences in blood pressure and obesity between 
      Galicia and other areas of Spain, already previously suggested in adults, can be the 
      reflection of differences present from childhood.

TI  - A cDNA clone for a novel nuclear protein with DNA binding activity.
PG  - 618-24
AB  - In an effort to identify trans-acting factors regulating specific genes, we cloned a 
      novel human gene, DBP-5. The cDNA clone contains a predicted open reading frame 
      coding for a potential 1,179 amino acid protein. The mRNA corresponding to DBP-5 is 
      ubiquitously distributed, and the gene is phylogenetically conserved. 
      Immunofluorescence analyses with several cell lines indicate that the protein is 
      localized to the nucleus. Sequence analysis revealed unusual features of the 
      predicted protein structure, including four completely conserved repeats. The 
      phylogenetic conservation of DBP-5, the ubiquity of its expression, its nuclear 
      localization, and its ability to bind DNA sequences, raise the possibility that 
      DBP-5 may play a role in the organization of interphase chromatin and/or in 
      transcriptional regulation.

TI  - In vivo recruitment of exon junction complex proteins to transcription sites in 
      mammalian cell nuclei.
PG  - 622-33
AB  - Studies over the past years indicate that there is extensive coupling between 
      nuclear export of mRNA and pre-mRNA processing. Here, we visualized the distribution 
      of exon junction complex (EJC) proteins and RNA export factors relative to sites of 
      abundant pre-mRNA synthesis in the nucleus. We analyzed both HeLa cells infected 
      with adenovirus and murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells stably transfected with the 
      human beta-globin gene. Using in situ hybridization and confocal microscopy, we 
      observe accumulation of EJC proteins (REF/Aly, Y14, SRm160, UAP56, RNPS1, and Magoh) 
      and core spliceosome components (U snRNPs) at sites of transcription. This suggests 
      that EJC proteins bind stably to pre-mRNA cotranscriptionally. No concentration of 
      the export factors NXF1/TAP, p15, and Dbp5 was detected on nascent transcripts, 
      arguing that in mammalian cells these proteins bind the mRNA shortly before or after 
      release from the sites of transcription. These results also suggest that binding of 
      EJC proteins to the mRNA is not sufficient to recruit TAP-p15, consistent with 
      recent findings showing that the EJC does not play a crucial role in mRNA export. 
      Contrasting to the results obtained in MEL cells expressing normal human beta-globin 
      transcripts, mutant pre-mRNAs defective in splicing and 3'end processing do not 
      colocalize with SRm160, REF, UAP56, or Sm proteins. This shows that the accumulation 
      of EJC proteins at transcription sites requires efficient processing of the nascent 
      pre-mRNAs, arguing that transcription per se is not sufficient for the stable 
      assembly of the EJC.

TI  - A negative regulatory element-dependent inhibitory role of ITF2B on IL-2 receptor 
      alpha gene.
PG  - 142-9
AB  - Despite the fact that the negative regulatory element (NRE) within the upstream 
      regulatory region of human IL-2 receptor alpha (IL-2Ralpha) gene has been identified 
      two decades ago, mechanisms of the NRE function on the gene are hitherto unknown. In 
      this paper, we report for the first time that the immunoglobulin transcription 
      factor 2B (ITF2B) encoded by transcription factor 4 (TCF4) gene is a NRE binding 
      protein. The full-length TCF4 cDNA clone was obtained from a HTLV-1 transformed 
      human peripheral T cell MACHERMAKER cDNA library with NRE as the bait in yeast 
      one-hybrid system. The NRE binding ability of ITF2B was further confirmed in 
      chromatin-immunoprecipitation assay. Competitive RT-PCR-based promoter activity 
      assay showed that over-expression of ITF2B protein inhibited the expression of 
      IL-2Ralpha gene in Jurkat cells in an NRE-dependent manner. The function of ITF2B on 
      the inhibition of both the IL-2Ralpha and the 5'LTR activity of HIV-1 shed light on 
      the essence of NRE binding protein as a potential target for immune therapy and 
      treatment in AIDS patients.

TI  - InsP6-sensitive variants of the Gle1 mRNA export factor rescue growth and fertility 
      defects of the ipk1 low-phytic-acid mutation in Arabidopsis.
PG  - 417-31
LID - 10.1105/tpc.114.132134 [doi]
AB  - Myo-inositol-1,2,3,4,5,6-hexakisphosphate (InsP(6)), also known as phytic acid, 
      accumulates in large quantities in plant seeds, serving as a phosphorus reservoir, 
      but is an animal antinutrient and an important source of water pollution. Here, we 
      report that Gle1 (GLFG lethal 1) in conjunction with InsP(6) functions as an 
      activator of the ATPase/RNA helicase LOS4 (low expression of osmotically responsive 
      genes 4), which is involved in mRNA export in plants, supporting the 
      Gle1-InsP(6)-Dbp5 (LOS4 homolog) paradigm proposed in yeast. Interestingly, plant 
      Gle1 proteins have modifications in several key residues of the InsP(6) binding 
      pocket, which reduce the basicity of the surface charge. Arabidopsis thaliana Gle1 
      variants containing mutations that increase the basic charge of the InsP(6) binding 
      surface show increased sensitivity to InsP(6) concentrations for the stimulation of 
      LOS4 ATPase activity in vitro. Expression of the Gle1 variants with enhanced InsP(6) 
      sensitivity rescues the mRNA export defect of the ipk1 (inositol 
      1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate 2-kinase) InsP(6)-deficient mutant and, furthermore, 
      significantly improves vegetative growth, seed yield, and seed performance of the 
      mutant. These results suggest that Gle1 is an important factor responsible for 
      mediating InsP(6) functions in plant growth and reproduction and that Gle1 variants 
      with increased InsP(6) sensitivity may be useful for engineering high-yielding 
      low-phytate crops.

TI  - Dbp5p, a cytosolic RNA helicase, is required for poly(A)+ RNA export.
PG  - 2651-62
AB  - The DBP5 gene encodes a putative RNA helicase of unknown function in the yeast 
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae. It is shown here that Dbp5p is an ATP-dependent RNA 
      helicase required for polyadenylated [poly(A)+] RNA export. Surprisingly, Dbp5p is 
      present predominantly, if not exclusively, in the cytoplasm, and is highly enriched 
      around the nuclear envelope. This observation raises the possibility that Dbp5p may 
      play a role in unloading or remodeling messenger RNA particles (mRNPs) upon arrival 
      in the cytoplasm and in coupling mRNP export and translation. The functions of Dbp5p 
      are likely to be conserved, since its potential homologues can be found in a variety 
      of eukaryotic cells.

TI  - Cuff bladder width and blood pressure measurement in children and adolescents.
PG  - 1235-41
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To estimate the independent contribution of the blood pressure cuff 
      bladder width: mid-upper arm circumference (CW:AC) ratio to the variability in 
      systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure phase 4 (DBP4) and diastolic 
      blood pressure phase 5 (DBP5) in children and adolescents, and its impact upon the 
      estimate of prevalence of high blood pressure derived at screening. DESIGN: Use of 
      cuffs with a CW:AC ratio below 40% causes overestimation of the true blood pressure 
      level. With higher CW:AC ratios the level is underestimated. National 
      recommendations for adults state that the CW:AC ratio is optimal at approximately 
      40%, but no consistent recommendations exist for children. METHODS: We measured SBP 
      and diastolic blood pressure phases 4 and 5 in 811 boys and 771 girls aged 10-17 
      years (93% participation rate). In each subject the blood pressure was measured with 
      a cuff conforming to the 40% rule (recommended cuff), with one smaller (mean 
      decrease in the CW:AC ratio:7.4%), and with one larger (mean increase in the CW:AC 
      ratio:10.2%). Cuffs were used in random order. RESULTS: Smaller cuffs gave 
      significantly higher blood pressure readings. With the larger cuff there were 
      significant mean decreases. The differences were independent of the blood pressure 
      level obtained with the recommended cuff. The impact upon the estimate of the 
      prevalence of high blood pressure was substantial. CONCLUSIONS: Selection of the 
      proper cuff size is important for children and adolescents, in order to avoid both 
      over- and underdiagnosis of hypertension.

TI  - National standards of blood pressure for children and adolescents in Spain: 
      international comparisons. The Spanish Group for the Study of Cardiovascular Risk 
      Factors in Childhood and Youth.
PG  - 478-87
AB  - This study determined age-specific patterns of blood pressure (BP) in Spanish 
      children aged 1-18 years for the purpose of developing BP guidelines for this 
      population. Age- and sex-specific BP levels were constructed by pooling data from 15 
      studies conducted in Spain. Pooled mean BP levels were then compared with those 
      reported by the US Second Task Force on Blood Pressure Control in Children and those 
      recently reported from a separate pooled analysis of the relevant published surveys 
      collected worldwide. In the Spanish data, the average 1-year age increment in 
      Systolic BP (SBP) was uniform for boys and girls until 13 years at 2 mmHg; for boys 
      aged 13-18 the increase was 1.3 mmHg/year; in contrast, girls reached their maximum 
      values at age 13 and the means remained basically unchanged for female adolescents. 
      Fifth-phase diastolic BP (DBP5) values showed a uniform increase for both boys and 
      girls from ages 6 to 18 years at 0.9 mmHg/year. In most age-sex subgroups, mean SBP 
      values were higher (7-8 mmHg on average) in Spain than in the US. However, Spanish 
      values for SBP were in general only slightly higher or approximately equal to those 
      for the international data, from ages 6 to 18 years. The patterns of change in SBP 
      with age differed somewhat in the three data sets. Comparisons for DBP were limited 
      to the age groups for which readings of DBP5 were available. For DBP5, only slight 
      differences between the Spanish and International pools were observed (ages 6-18 
      compared), but these values were notably higher than those from the US (ages 13-18 
      compared). These findings suggest that the use of any particular age-based standard 
      to evaluate readings in children in diverse populations cannot be recommended, at 
      least until there is a better understanding of the true differences in BP between 
      populations.

TI  - Conserved gene sequences for species identification: PCR analysis of the 3' UTR of 
      the SON gene distinguishes human and other mammalian DNAs.
PG  - 171-81
AB  - In this paper we show that the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can be used on 
      regions of highly conserved genes, such as the 3' untranslated region (3' UTR) of 
      the SON gene, to identify the mammalian origin of a sample. Using this test, we have 
      been able to distinguish human, monkey, cat, dog, mouse and hamster DNAs. We have 
      also determined the DNA sequence of these different PCR products, which can be used 
      to reinforce species identification. The advantages of this test are that: (i) no 
      prior information is required on the possible species origin of a sample, (ii) the 
      reaction produces a single PCR product which varies in size according to the species 
      of origin, making the test simple to interpret, and (iii) the target region of DNA 
      amplified in these experiments is small and can easily be sequenced and sized using 
      automated techniques. This small size has enabled us to successfully amplify this 
      product from DNA extracted from compromised material (human bone samples) and so 
      demonstrate that the test is valuable for the characterisation of remains in which 
      DNA is degraded.

TI  - Transcription factor decoy to study the molecular mechanism of negative regulation 
      of renin gene expression in the liver in vivo.
PG  - 1059-66
AB  - Renin is synthesized in high quantities in the juxtaglomerular cells of the kidney, 
      but little or none is synthesized in the liver. Our previous in vitro and 
      biochemical studies have demonstrated that tissue-specific expression of the mouse 
      renin gene is regulated by the specific interaction between negative regulatory 
      element (NRE) in the 5'-flanking region of the renin gene and NRE binding protein 
      (NREB). In this study, we examined the hypothesis that this interaction between the 
      NRE in the promoter region of the rat renin gene and the NREB in the liver 
      contributes to the suppressed renin gene expression in this tissue in vivo. We used 
      in vivo transfection of NRE transcription factor decoy (TFD) double-stranded 
      oligonucleotide into the rat liver via portal vein infusion. A gel mobility shift 
      assay showed that transfected NRE TFD blocked endogenous NREB binding with the rat 
      renin gene. This resulted in enhanced hepatic renin mRNA expression, 
      immunohistochemical detection of renin in the liver, and consequently, increased 
      plasma renin concentration. Taken together, these results document the importance of 
      NREB in the inhibition of renin gene expression in rat liver in vivo and suggest the 
      possibility of in vivo renin gene modulation by the TFD approach.

AB  - Telomerases protect the ends of linear chromosomes from shortening. They are 
      composed of an RNA (TLC1 in S. cerevisiae) and several proteins. TLC1 undergoes 
      several maturation steps before it is exported into the cytoplasm to recruit the Est 
      proteins for complete assembly. The mature telomerase is subsequently reimported 
      into the nucleus, where it fulfills its function on telomeres. Here, we show that 
      TLC1 export into the cytoplasm requires not only the Ran GTPase-dependent 
      karyopherin Crm1/Xpo1 but also the mRNA export machinery. mRNA export factor mutants 
      accumulate mature and export-competent TLC1 RNAs in their nuclei. Moreover, TLC1 
      physically interacts with the mRNA transport factors Mex67 and Dbp5/Rat8. Most 
      importantly, we show that the nuclear export of TLC1 is an essential step for the 
      formation of the functional RNA containing enzyme, because blocking TLC1 export in 
      the mex67-5 xpo1-1 double mutant prevents its cytoplasmic maturation and leads to 
      telomere shortening.

AB  - The DEAD-box protein Dbp5 was thought to remodel ribonucleoproteins and displace 
      proteins from these complexes in an ATP-dependent fashion to allow for mRNA export 
      from the nucleus. A recent study on Dbp5 shows, however, that its ADP-bound form may 
      also perform an important function in displacing export factors from mRNA.

TI  - Complex chromosomal rearrangements of human chromosome 21 in a patient manifesting 
      clinical features partially overlapped with that of Down syndrome.
PG  - 1555-1563
LID - 10.1007/s00439-020-02196-6 [doi]
AB  - The chromosomal region critical in Down syndrome has long been analyzed through 
      genotype-phenotype correlation studies using data from many patients with partial 
      trisomy 21. Owing to that, a relatively small region of human chromosome 21 
      (35.9 ~ 38.0 Mb) has been considered as Down syndrome critical region (DSCR). In 
      this study, microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization analysis identified 
      complex rearrangements of chromosome 21 in a patient manifesting clinical features 
      partially overlapped with that of Down syndrome. Although the patient did not show 
      up-slanting palpebral fissures and single transverse palmar creases, other symptoms 
      were consistent with Down syndrome. Rearrangements were analyzed by whole-genome 
      sequencing using Nanopore long-read sequencing. The analysis revealed that 
      chromosome 21 was fragmented into seven segments and reassembled by six connected 
      points. Among 12 breakpoints, 5 are located within the short region and overlapped 
      with repeated segments. The rearrangement resulted in a maximum gain of five copies, 
      but no region showed loss of genomic copy numbers. Breakpoint-junctions showed no 
      homologous region. Based on these findings, chromoanasynthesis was considered as the 
      mechanism. Although the distal 21q22.13 region was not included in the aberrant 
      regions, some of the genes located on the duplicated regions, SOD1, SON, ITSN1, 
      RCAN1, and RUNX1, were considered as possible candidate genes for clinical features 
      of the patient. We discussed the critical region for Down syndrome, with the 
      literature review.

TI  - An HMG1-like protein facilitates Wnt signaling in Caenorhabditis elegans.
PG  - 877-89
AB  - We show that during Caenorhabditis elegans male spicule development, the 
      specification of a glial versus neuronal cell fate in a canonical neurogenic 
      sublineage is dependent on Wnt signaling. Inactivation of a Wnt signaling pathway 
      mediated by the Wnt receptor LIN-17 transforms the SPD sheath cell into its sister, 
      the SPD neuron. We discovered a new mutant, son-1, that displays this same cell fate 
      transformation. The son-1 mutation enhances the phenotypes of reduction-of-function 
      lin-17 mutants in several developmental processes, including vulva development, 
      somatic gonad development, and male tail patterning. son-1 encodes an HMG1/2-like 
      DNA-binding protein and is localized in all cell nuclei through development as 
      revealed by a GFP reporter construct. Disruption of son-1 function by RNA-mediated 
      interference results in the same spicule defect as caused by overexpression of 
      POP-1, a TCF/LEF class HMG protein known to act downstream of the Wnt signaling 
      pathway. Our results provide in vivo evidence for the functional involvement of an 
      HMG1/2-like protein, SON-1, in Wnt signaling. The sequence nonspecific HMG protein 
      SON-1 and the sequence specific HMG protein POP-1 might both act in the Wnt 
      responding cells to regulate gene transcription in opposite directions.

TI  - mRNA 5' region sequence incompleteness: a potential source of systematic errors in 
      translation initiation codon assignment in human mRNAs.
PG  - 185-93
AB  - The amino acid sequence of gene products is routinely deduced from the nucleotide 
      sequence of the relative cloned cDNA, according to the rules for recognition of 
      start codon (first-AUG rule, optimal sequence context) and the genetic code. From 
      this prediction stem most subsequent types of product analysis, although all 
      standard methods for cDNA cloning are affected by a potential inability to 
      effectively clone the 5' region of mRNA. Revision by bioinformatics and cloning 
      methods of 109 known genes located on human chromosome 21 (HC 21) shows that 60 
      mRNAs lack any in-frame stop upstream of the first-AUG, and that in five cases 
      (DSCR1, KIAA0184, KIAA0539, SON, and TFF3) the coding region at the 5' end was 
      incompletely characterized in the original descriptions. We describe the respective 
      consequences for genomic annotation, domain and ortholog identification, and 
      functional experiments design. We have also analyzed the sequences of 13,124 human 
      mRNAs (RefSeq databank), discovering that in 6448 cases (49%), an in-frame stop 
      codon is present upstream of the initiation codon, while in the other 6676 mRNAs 
      (51%), identification of additional bases at the mRNA 5' region could well reveal 
      some new upstream in-frame AUG codons in the optimal context. Proportionally to the 
      HC 21 data, about 550 known human genes might thus be affected by this 5' end mRNA 
      artifact.

PG  - 731-9
AB  - We have investigated the functional activity of human son gene, that possesses the 
      homology to mos and myc genes. Specific antibodies (antiserum) were raised to 
      synthetic peptide, that corresponds to son-protein 943-963 amino acid residues. With 
      this antiserum the presence of son-protein was showed in lysates of cultured human 
      cells transformed by adenovirus type 5, RAT 2 cells and primary human embryonic 
      fibroblasts. son-Protein molecular weight (92 kDa) was determined by the method of 
      electrophoresis in SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Thus, it was shown the presence of son 
      gene protein in animal and human cells. To determine a possible son gene role in 
      mammalian cells we have cloned the 3' part (2667 b.p.) of son cDNA in retroviral 
      vector pPS-3-neo. Transformed cells of different lines were selected. A large 
      portion of this cells changed their morphology. New protein product (120 k), that 
      reacted with antiserum to son specific peptide, was found together with p92son in 
      these clones.

TI  - Insights into mRNP biogenesis provided by new genetic interactions among export and 
      transcription factors.
PG  - 80
LID - 10.1186/1471-2156-13-80 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The various steps of mRNP biogenesis (transcription, processing and 
      export) are interconnected. It has been shown that the transcription machinery plays 
      a pivotal role in mRNP assembly, since several mRNA export factors are recruited 
      during transcription and physically interact with components of the transcription 
      machinery. Although the shuttling DEAD-box protein Dbp5p is concentrated on the 
      cytoplasmic fibrils of the NPC, previous studies demonstrated that it interacts 
      physically and genetically with factors involved in transcription initiation. 
      RESULTS: We investigated the effect of mutations affecting various components of the 
      transcription initiation apparatus on the phenotypes of mRNA export mutant strains. 
      Our results show that growth and mRNA export defects of dbp5 and mex67 mutant 
      strains can be suppressed by mutation of specific transcription initiation 
      components, but suppression was not observed for mutants acting in the very first 
      steps of the pre-initiation complex (PIC) formation. CONCLUSIONS: Our results 
      indicate that mere reduction in the amount of mRNP produced is not sufficient to 
      suppress the defects caused by a defective mRNA export factor. Suppression occurs 
      only with mutants affecting events within a narrow window of the mRNP biogenesis 
      process. We propose that reducing the speed with which transcription converts from 
      initiation and promoter clearance to elongation may have a positive effect on mRNP 
      formation by permitting more effective recruitment of partially-functional mRNP 
      proteins to the nascent mRNP.

TI  - Functional conservation of Dhh1p, a cytoplasmic DExD/H-box protein present in large 
      complexes.
PG  - 4995-5002
AB  - The DHH1 gene in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes a putative RNA helicase 
      of remarkable sequence similarity to several other DExD/H-box proteins, including 
      Xp54 in Xenopus laevis and Ste13p in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. We show here that 
      over-expression of Xp54, an integral component of the stored messenger 
      ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) particles, can rescue the loss of Dhh1p in yeast. 
      Localization and sedimentation studies showed that Dhh1p exists predominantly in the 
      cytoplasm and is present in large complexes whose sizes appear to vary according to 
      the growth stage of the cell culture. In addition, deletion of dhh1, when placed in 
      conjunction with the mutant dbp5 and ded1 alleles, resulted in a synergistically 
      lethal effect, suggesting that Dhh1p may have a role in mRNA export and translation. 
      Finally, similar to Ste13p, Dhh1p is required for sporulation in the budding yeast. 
      Taken together, our data provide evidence that the functions of Dhh1p are conserved 
      through evolution.

TI  - Rat8p/Dbp5p is a shuttling transport factor that interacts with Rat7p/Nup159p and 
      Gle1p and suppresses the mRNA export defect of xpo1-1 cells.
PG  - 5778-88
AB  - In a screen for temperature-sensitive mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae defective 
      for mRNA export, we previously identified the essential DEAD-box protein Dbp5p/Rat8p 
      and the nucleoporin Rat7p/Nup159p. Both are essential for mRNA export. Here we 
      report that Dbp5p and Rat7p interact through their Nterminal domains. Deletion of 
      this portion of Rat7p (Rat7pDeltaN) results in strong defects in mRNA export and 
      eliminates association of Dbp5p with nuclear pores. Overexpression of Dbp5p 
      completely suppressed the growth and mRNA export defects of rat7DeltaN cells and 
      resulted in weaker suppression in cells carrying rat7-1 or the rss1-37 allele of 
      GLE1. Dbp5p interacts with Gle1p independently of the N-terminus of Dbp5p. Dbp5p 
      shuttles between nucleus and cytoplasm in an Xpo1p-dependent manner. It accumulates 
      in nuclei of xpo1-1 cells and in cells with mutations affecting Mex67p (mex67-5), 
      Gsp1p (Ran) or Ran effectors. Overexpression of Dbp5p prevents nuclear accumulation 
      of mRNA in xpo1-1 cells, but does not restore growth, suggesting that the RNA export 
      defect of xpo1-1 cells may be indirect. In a screen for high-copy suppressors of the 
      rat8-2 allele of DBP5, we identified YMR255w, now called GFD1. Gfd1p is not 
      essential, interacts with Gle1p and Rip1p/Nup42p, and is found in the cytoplasm and 
      at the nuclear rim.

TI  - [son Pseudogenes do not contain five repeating elements of the region of complete 
      tandem repeats present in the homologous sequence of the son gene].
PG  - 109-19
AB  - Recently we have published a sequence of the coding region of the son gene, 
      containing at least six areas of the tandem repeats [V.V. Bliskovsky, F.B. 
      Berdichevsky, A.V. Tkachenko, M.E. Belova, I.M. Chumakov--Molecularnaya biologiya, 
      1992, V. 26. P. 793-806; V.V. Bliskovsky, A.V. Kirillov, V.M. Zacharyev, I.M. 
      Chumakov--Molecularnaya biologiya, 1992, V. 26. P. 807-812]. The presence of several 
      areas of tandem repeats with different nucleotide sequences of the repeated elements 
      within one and the same gene supports the proposition that genomic localization of 
      the sequence influences its duplication. Here we present a nucleotide sequence of 
      the son pseudogene isolated as the result of hybridization screening of a human 
      genomic library using the sequence of the son gene as a probe. The comparison of the 
      gene and the pseudogene nucleotide sequences shows that the sequence of pseudogene 
      does not contain five repeated units of an area of the tandem repeats, which are 
      presented in the homology sequence of the son gene. Because the pseudogene was 
      probably generated by the reverse son-gene transcript insertion to the genome, and 
      so the nucleotide sequences of the coding region of the gene and the sequence of the 
      pseudogene were identical at this moment, the differences between the gene and the 
      pseudogene are the results of their evolution after the generation of the 
      pseudogene. Possible factors, influenced the son gene and the son pseudogene 
      evolution are discussed.

TI  - A functional role for interleukin (IL)-4-driven cyclic amp accumulation in human b 
      lymphocytes.
PG  - 731-6
AB  - Interleukin-4 (IL-4) regulates the expression of the 55-kDa alpha-subunit (CD25) of 
      the IL-2 receptor complex in human B lymphocytes. This report suggests that the 
      cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) component of the IL-4 receptor signalling programme in 
      human tonsillar B cells has a functionally important role in regulating expression 
      of the CD25 gene by attenuating activity of a protein binding to a potent negative 
      regulatory element (NRE) in the CD25 promoter; this effect can be mimicked by agents 
      that elevate cAMP and blocked by inhibitors of PKA but not protein kinase C (PKC). 
      In a B-cell line that fails to elevate cAMP, attenuate NRE-binding protein (NRE-BP) 
      activity or express CD25 following IL-4 treatment, stimulation of cAMP accumulation 
      by forskolin facilitates IL-4-mediated induction of both the endogenous gene and an 
      exogenous reporter gene under the control of a minimal promoter/enhancer fragment of 
      the CD25 gene.

TI  - Dose dependent expression of HDAC4 causes variable expressivity in a novel inherited 
      case of brachydactyly mental retardation syndrome.
PG  - 2015-20
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.a.35463 [doi]
AB  - Histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) serves important roles in multiple human systems, 
      including neurological, cardiac, and skeletal functions. Mutation or deletion of 
      HDAC4 causes brachydactyly mental retardation syndrome (BDMR), a disorder that 
      includes intellectual disability, behavioral abnormalities, autism spectrum 
      disorder, and craniofacial and skeletal anomalies, including brachydactyly type E. 
      We present a case of familial BDMR, including a parent with mild symptoms of the 
      disorder and a child exhibiting a more severe phenotype. Cytogenetic testing showed 
      a cryptic balanced translocation in the mother that resulted in a 2q37.1 monosomy 
      and a 10q26.1 trisomy in the son. Gene expression analyses demonstrated 67% HDAC4 
      expression in the mother and 23% HDAC4 expression in the son relative to normal 
      controls, lending evidence to the hypothesis that HDAC4 modulates severity of this 
      disorder in a dosage-dependent manner.

TI  - Obesity, sodium intake, and blood pressure in adolescents.
PG  - 78-82
AB  - It has been postulated that increased dietary sodium associated with greater food 
      intake by obese people is a mechanism for the relationship between obesity and blood 
      pressure (BP). We have evaluated this hypothesis by exploring the interrelationships 
      of measures of obesity, sodium intake, and BP in 248 "normal" adolescents, 16 to 17 
      years of age. As an index of sodium intake, the sodium excretion in three overnight 
      urine collections was used. As a more specific index of saltiness of diet, we used a 
      ratio of sodium excretion to calorie intake, with calories estimated from 3-day diet 
      records and dietary interview. Body weight and other measures of obesity showed a 
      positive relationship with systolic blood pressure (SBP), but not with diastolic 
      (K5) blood pressure (DBP5). Measures of overnight sodium excretion were positively 
      correlated with body weight and calculated body fat percentage, suggesting that 
      heavier people indeed ingest more sodium. This may result not from increased intake 
      of food per se, but from increased saltiness of diet, since calorie intake did not 
      increase with body weight. No significant relationships were found between BP and 
      concurrent measures of sodium excretion or diet saltiness.

TI  - Identification of a protein that recognizes a distal negative regulatory element 
      within the mouse mammary tumor virus long terminal repeat.
PG  - 211-9
AB  - The mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) long terminal repeat contains a distal negative 
      regulatory element (dNRE) that selectively represses activity of the proviral 
      promoter in the absence of steroid hormone receptor-mediated activation. A protein, 
      termed MMTV NRE-binding protein 1 (MNBP-1), that recognizes long terminal repeat 
      sequences between -433 and -418 was identified by gel electrophoresis mobility shift 
      assays and methylation interference footprinting in nuclear extracts of HeLa and 
      Ltk(-) cells. Mutations within the defined binding site affect dNRE-mediated 
      promoter repression in vivo. MNBP-1 has an apparent molecular mass of approximately 
      100 kDa as determined by gel filtration chromatography.

TI  - [Coding part of the son gene small transcript contains four areas of complete tandem 
      repeats].
PG  - 793-806
AB  - Overlapping cDNA clones for the smaller son gene transcript were isolated by several 
      steps of human placenta cDNA library walking. Here we report the structure of 
      repeats that exist at the long open reading, present in the structure of this 
      smaller (5.6 kb) transcript of human gene son. We were able to identify in this 
      transcript four areas of complete tandem repeats, formed by several steps of 
      duplication. For three of them the extent of homology between amino acid sequences 
      of repeated elements is higher than between their nucleic acid sequences. It means 
      that amino acid sequences of repeated elements are conserved, that could reflect the 
      structural significance for the function of hypothetical protein product of human 
      gene son. On the basis of the results of analysis we proposed the model for the 
      formation of repeats by processes of duplication, mutation and natural selection 
      pressure at the expressed protein level.
