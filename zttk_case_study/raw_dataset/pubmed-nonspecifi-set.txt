TI  - Genes responsible for nonspecific mental retardation.
PG  - 104-8
AB  - Mental retardation (MR) is a group of heterogeneous clinical conditions. There are 
      more than 900 genetic disorders associated with MR and it affects around 3% of the 
      general population. MR can be subdivided into syndromic, if it is characterized by 
      consistent and distinctive clinical findings, and nonspecific, if mental retardation 
      is the only primary symptom among affected individuals. Many MR conditions described 
      are syndromic, fragile X syndrome being the most common clinical entity among them. 
      In the past years, knowledge of the molecular basis of mental retardation has 
      increased remarkably. Eight genes involved in nonspecific X-linked MR have been 
      identified so far, including FMR2, OPHN1, GDI1, PAK3, IL1RAPL, TM4SF2, VCX-A, and 
      ARHGEF6. Two other genes also located on the X chromosome have been involved both in 
      syndromic and in MRX forms (RSK2 and XNP/ATR-X). New insights into the pathogenesis 
      of mental retardation are being provided by the discovery of these genes involved in 
      different cellular signaling pathways in the central nervous system although many 
      others remain to be identified.

AB  - Clinical manifestations and other aspects of nonspecific X-linked mental retardation 
      are reviewed using data from the literature and information on affected males in 24 
      new families ascertained in British Columbia. A great degree of variability was 
      apparent in the mental abilities of affected males. Speech defects, other CNS 
      disorders and minor physical changes such as "big" ears or a highly arched palate 
      were not present in many cases. Evidence for the existence of a clinical entity of 
      mental retardation associated with the fragile site at Xq27 or 28 and 
      macro-orchidism is discussed. Genetic phenomena of reduced penetrance in males and 
      of partial expression in females with respect of X-linked recessive genes are 
      examined. Consideration is given to the question of whether this type of mental 
      retardation is due to X-linked recessive or autosomal dominant sex-limited genes. 
      Most ascertained cases of X-linked mental retardation are from families of northern 
      European extraction. Recommendations are made regarding the diagnosis and counseling 
      of X-linked mental retardation cases.

AB  - Mental retardation (MR) is a symptom in a large group of clinical conditions and 
      affects around 3% of the population. MR is divided into syndromic, if it is 
      characterized by distinctive clinical features and nonspecific when mental 
      retardation is the only defining manifestation. Although genetic causes of X-linked 
      mental retardation (XLMR) are heterogenous and complex, recent findings have led to 
      the identification of an increasing number of genes involved in these conditions. 
      Eight genes involved in nonspecific X-linked mental retardation have been identified 
      so far, including FMR2, GDI1, OPHN1, PAK3, ARHGEF6, IL1RAPL, TM4SF2, and FACL4. Four 
      other MECP2, RSK2, ARX, ATR-X are involved in syndromic and nonspecific forms of MR. 
      Recent research has shown that these genes encode for proteins involved in signaling 
      pathways which regulate cytoskeleton organization, synaptic vesicle transport and 
      establishment of connections between neuronal cells. These findings provide insight 
      into the molecular mechanisms of crucial processes for the development of 
      intellectual and cognitive functions.

AB  - Aim of this review is to present the latest advances in the identification of the 
      genetic determinants of intellectual deficiency. Mental retardation (MR) is often 
      associated with other neurologic symptoms, metabolic disorders, or malformation 
      syndromes. The purpose of the review is to subdivide the large field of MR into 
      categories that may help professionals in making a diagnosis. Nonspecific MR can 
      also segregate in families and the mapping and cloning of corresponding mutant genes 
      will eventually advance our understanding of normal and abnormal brain functioning. 
      Several genes responsible for nonspecific X-linked mental retardation have been 
      identified in the last 12 to 24 months and are being intensively investigated. This 
      will hopefully lead to new possibilities of either genetic or pharmacological 
      therapy.

PG  - 95-109
AB  - Mental retardation, in particular the "X-linked" type, has interested geneticists 
      for many years. An increasing number of affected families have been to genetic 
      counselling centres, and an effort is being made to find clinical and cytogenetic 
      methods so a reliable diagnosis can be made. This would enable the detection of 
      carriers and the opportunity to offer prenatal diagnosis. Many questions remain 
      regarding X-linked mental retardation, its causes, diagnosis, and prevention. In 
      this article we try to give an overview about the status of our present knowledge 
      and the questions to be answered in the future.

PG  - S77-83
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Non-specific mental retardation is defined by the absence of somatic, 
      neurological, biochemical or behavioural features that characterise a particular 
      clinical variant and accounts for a large percentage of cases of X-linked mental 
      retardation (XLMR). Genetic linkage studies showed it to have a high rate of genetic 
      heterogeneity. DEVELOPMENT: To date, genetic linkage studies or the characterisation 
      of chromosomal rearrangement in patients have allowed 22 different genes to be 
      identified. Some of the most notable of these are the genes responsible for 
      syndromic forms, such as RPS6KA3, ARX, JARID1C, XNP or MeCP2, in which the mildest 
      mutations, with a certain amount of functional activity, cause non-specific 
      retardation. The proteins these genes code for are directly or indirectly involved 
      in regulating the expression of other genes. Moreover, genes such as OPHN1, PAK3, 
      ARHGEF6, FGD1 or TM4SF2 code for proteins that interact with rho GTPases, and play a 
      role in the transmission of signals that regulate the development of axons and 
      dendrites. Other types of functions of the known genes include establishing and 
      modulating synapses (DLG3, IL1RAPL, NLGN4X, GDI1), regulating transcription (ZNF41, 
      ZNF81, PQBP1) translation (FTSJ1), and fatty acid metabolism (FACL4), etc. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Each gene that has been identified only accounts for a minor fraction 
      of the total amount of XLMR, and even if taken together they still do not explain 
      half the cases of non-specific XLMR. The number of XLMR genes is expected to rise in 
      coming years with the development of new techniques that will facilitate diagnosis 
      and genetic counselling in the relatively near future.

AB  - X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) affects 1.8 per thousand male births and is 
      usually categorized as "syndromic" (MRXS) or "non-specific" (MRX) forms according to 
      the presence or absence of specific signs in addition to the MR. Up to 60 genes have 
      been implicated in XLMR and certain mutations can alternatively lead to MRXS or MRX. 
      Indeed the extreme phenotypic and allelic heterogeneity of XLMR makes the 
      classification of most genes difficult. Therefore, following identification of new 
      genes, accurate retrospective clinical evaluation of patients and their families is 
      necessary to aid the molecular diagnosis and the classification of this 
      heterogeneous group of disorders. Analyses of the protein products corresponding to 
      XLMR genes show a great diversity of cellular pathways involved in MR. Common 
      mechanisms are beginning to emerge : a first group of proteins belongs to the Rho 
      and Rab GTPase signaling pathways involved in neuronal differentiation and synaptic 
      plasticity and a second group is related to the regulation of gene expression. In 
      this review, we illustrate the complexity of XLMR conditions and present recent data 
      about the FMR1, ARX and Oligophrenin 1 genes.

AB  - It has long been known that among patients with mental retardation males outnumber 
      females. This is the result of mutations in X-chromosomal genes: X-linked mental 
      retardation. Its prevalence has been estimated as 1.8/1000 males with a carrier 
      frequency of 2.4/1000 females. X-linked mental retardation is divided into syndromic 
      and non-specific types. At present there are about 135 syndromic forms known of 26 
      of which the responsible genes and mutations have been found. 8 genes are known in 
      which mutations have been found in non-specific X-linked mental retardation. It is 
      estimated that about 100 genes are involved in the latter. These genes are in 
      particular involved in the function of the central nervous system. The development 
      of a complete genetic map of the X-chromosome and the introduction of microarray 
      techniques will in the short term enormously enhance the elucidation of X-linked 
      mental retardation.

TI  - Mental retardation and Xq12-Xq23: candidate loci for nonspecific mental retardation 
      in the male population of the QinBa region.
PG  - 27-31
LID - 10.1097/YPG.0b013e3283121d05 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The higher prevalence of nonspecific mental retardation (NSMR) presents 
      an important socioeconomic and medical issue for families and the whole QinBa region 
      in China. The obvious family aggregation and high heritability indicated that 
      genetic causes play a role in the NSMR population in QinBa. This study discusses the 
      relationship between Xq12-Xq23 region and NSMR in the QinBa area. METHOD: We chose 
      six short tandem repeats--DXS7132, DXS6979, DXS1191, DXS1230, DXS1072, and DXS6804, 
      located in Xq12-Xq23--and analyzed the distribution difference of their alleles 
      between the NSMR and control boys. RESULTS: A significant allele distribution 
      difference was found between NSMR and control boys (all P<0.05) for DXS7132, 
      DXS1191, DXS1230, DXS1072, and DXS6804 but not for DXS6979. CONCLUSION: Our results 
      suggest that Xq12-Xq23 may be the candidate region where there are one or more loci, 
      linked to NSMR in the QinBa region. Further study needs to be carried out for 
      locating the gene responsible for NSMR in this region and a larger sample size and 
      more genetic markers are needed.

TI  - Research in mental retardation: toward an etiologic approach.
PG  - 49-71
AB  - Over the past two decades, mental retardation research converges on three general 
      themes: co-occurring mental retardation and psychopathology; families of offspring 
      with mental retardation; and the developmental approach regarding behavioral 
      sequences and profiles. Intertwined with each theme is a mounting body of research 
      on genetic mental retardation syndromes. We first review recent progress in each of 
      the three domains--psychopathology, families, and development--based on studies of 
      groups with heterogenous or nonspecific mental retardation. We then show how new 
      findings from specific genetic syndromes take this knowledge even further, as well 
      as aid in the search for genetic, physiological, and environmental mechanisms 
      associated with certain behaviors. We end the review by briefly summarizing our 
      reasons for promoting an etiological approach to future mental retardation research, 
      as well as by discussing methodological and other challenges.

PG  - 280-5
AB  - Non-specific mental retardation is a very common and genetically heterogeneous 
      disorder but, to date, only six genes related to this condition have been 
      identified. Five of these six have been found in the past two years, through 
      positional-cloning efforts of mapped X-linked families. The characteristics of the 
      newly identified genes are providing insights into the molecular mechanisms of 
      mental impairment and the development of cognitive functions.

TI  - Nonspecific X-linked mental retardation II: the frequency in British Columbia.
PG  - 461-9
AB  - Data on nonspecific mental retardation in two or more sibs ascertained from the 
      British Columbia Health Surveillance Registry are utilized to calculate the 
      frequency of X-linked mental retardation in the population of British Columbia 
      (B.C.). In the 1950-1969 birth cohort there are 107 sibships with only males 
      affected and 35 sibships with only females affected giving an excess of 72 
      male-affected sibships. Family histories of the sibships with two more more mentally 
      retarded males provide evidence that the mothers of the excess of male-affected 
      sibships are carriers of X-linked mental retardation. Thus, a frequency of 1.83 per 
      1,000 males for X-linked mental retardation and carrier frequency of 2.44 per 1,000 
      females are calculated. This frequency can account for all the excess of males in 
      the population who are affected with nonspecific mental retardation. We estimate 
      that seven to 19 X-linked genes exist to cause nonspecific mental retardation, and 
      that the frequency of the marker-X chromosome, associated with X-linked mental 
      retardation in some families, may be 0.92 per 1,000 male births.

TI  - FACL4, encoding fatty acid-CoA ligase 4, is mutated in nonspecific X-linked mental 
      retardation.
PG  - 436-40
AB  - X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) is an inherited condition that causes failure to 
      develop cognitive abilities, owing to mutations in a gene on the X chromosome. The 
      latest XLMR update lists up to 136 conditions leading to 'syndromic', or 'specific', 
      mental retardation (MRXS) and 66 entries leading to 'nonspecific' mental retardation 
      (MRX). For 9 of the 66 MRX entries, the causative gene has been identified. Our 
      recent discovery of the contiguous gene deletion syndrome ATS-MR (previously known 
      as Alport syndrome, mental retardation, midface hypoplasia, elliptocytosis, OMIM 
      #300194), characterized by Alport syndrome (ATS) and mental retardation (MR), 
      indicated Xq22.3 as a region containing one mental retardation gene. Comparing the 
      extent of deletion between individuals with ATS-MR and individuals with ATS alone 
      allowed us to define a critical region for mental retardation of approximately 380 
      kb, containing four genes. Here we report the identification of two point mutations, 
      one missense and one splice-site change, in the gene FACL4 in two families with 
      nonspecific mental retardation. Analysis of enzymatic activity in lymphoblastoid 
      cell lines from affected individuals of both families revealed low levels compared 
      with normal cells, indicating that both mutations are null mutations. All carrier 
      females with either point mutations or genomic deletions in FACL4 showed a 
      completely skewed X-inactivation, suggesting that the gene influences survival 
      advantage. FACL4 is the first gene shown to be involved in nonspecific mental 
      retardation and fatty-acid metabolism.

PG  - 338-44
AB  - Mental retardation is a serious social problem. It affects 2-3% of the population. 
      It is estimated that mutations in the ARX gene can be found in 1 in 12,000 live male 
      births. This is the second most common cause of X-linked mental retardation after 
      fragile X syndrome. The ARX gene belongs to transcription factors involved in 
      differentiation of specific neuronal cells in the central nervous system. The most 
      common mutation in the ARX gene is c. 428_451dup24, duplication of 24 bp in exon 2 
      of the gene, causing elongation of the second alanine tract (polyA12_II). Described 
      disorders caused by mutations in the ARX gene include: hydrocephaly with abnormal 
      genitalia (HYD-AG), lissencephaly with abnormal genitalia (XLAG), agenesis of corpus 
      callosum with abnormal genitalia (ACC-AG), Partington syndrome (PRTS), X-linked 
      infantile spasms (ISSX), myoclonic epilepsy with spasticity and mental retardation 
      (XMESID), and nonspecific mental retardation (NS-XLMR).

PG  - 378-82
AB  - Non-specific X linked mental retardation (MRX) is mental retardation in persons of 
      normal physical appearance who have no recognisable features apart from a 
      characteristic pedigree. Review of published reports shows that there is clinical 
      variability in the degree of mental retardation within families and genetic 
      heterogeneity, based on gene localisation, between families. We propose a 
      classification based on genetic localisation and a set of minimal clinical features 
      that should be recorded in the hope of identifying possible specific phenotypes.

TI  - Monogenic causes of X-linked mental retardation.
PG  - 669-80
AB  - Mutations in X-linked genes are likely to account for the observation that more 
      males than females are affected by mental retardation. Causative mutations have 
      recently been identified in both syndromic X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) and in 
      the genetically heterogeneous 'nonspecific' forms of XLMR, for which cognitive 
      impairment is the only defining clinical feature. Proteins that function in 
      chromatin remodelling are affected in three important syndromic forms of XLMR. In 
      nonspecific forms of the disorder, defects have been found in signal-transduction 
      pathways that are believed to function during neuronal maturation. These findings 
      provide important insights into the molecular and cellular defects that underlie 
      mental retardation.

TI  - Rett syndrome.
PG  - 723-43
AB  - Rett syndrome (RS) is an X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder and the second most 
      common cause of genetic mental retardation in females. Different mutations in MECP2 
      are found in up to 95% of typical cases of RS. This mainly neuronal expressed gene 
      functions as a major transcription repressor. Extensive studies on girls who have RS 
      and mouse models are aimed at finding main gene targets for MeCP2 protein and 
      defining neuropathologic changes caused by its defects. Studies comparing autistic 
      features in RS with idiopathic autism and mentally retarded patients are presented. 
      Decreased dendritic arborization is common to RS and autism, leading to further 
      research on similarities in pathogenesis, including MeCP2 protein levels in autistic 
      brains and MeCP2 effects on genes connected to autism, like DLX5 and genes on 
      15q11-13 region. This area also is involved in Angelman syndrome, which has many 
      similarities to RS. Despite these connections, MECP2 mutations in nonspecific 
      autistic and mentally retarded populations are rare.

TI  - Rho proteins, mental retardation and the neurobiological basis of intelligence.
PG  - 295-317
AB  - For several decades it has been known that mental retardation is associated with 
      abnormalities in dendrites and dendritic spines. The recent cloning of eight genes 
      which cause nonspecific mental retardation when mutated, provides an important 
      insight into the cellular mechanisms that result in the dendritic abnormalities 
      underlying mental retardation. Three of the encoded proteins, oligophrenin1, PAK3 
      and alphaPix, interact directly with Rho GTPases. Rho GTPases are key signaling 
      proteins which integrate extracellular and intracellular signals to orchestrate 
      coordinated changes in the actin cytoskeleton, essential for directed neurite 
      outgrowth and the generation/rearrangement of synaptic connectivity. Although many 
      details of the cell biology of Rho signaling in the CNS are as yet unclear, a 
      picture is unfolding showing how mutations that cause abnormal Rho signaling result 
      in abnormal neuronal connectivity which gives rise to deficient cognitive 
      functioning in humans.

TI  - [X-linked mental retardation--treatment scheme].
PG  - 146-53
AB  - Mental retardation is a serious medical and social problem. The prevalence of mental 
      retardation is estimated at 2-3%. Establishing the cause of mental retardation is 
      extremely important for prognosis, management, and genetic counseling. It is 
      postulated that 25-35% of mental retardation cases may be of genetic background. 
      Among the genetic causes 25-30% are probably result of mutations located in the X 
      chromosome (X-linked mental retardation--XLMR). X-linked mental retardation is a 
      heterogeneous set of conditions responsible for a large proportion of inherited 
      mental retardation. More than 200 XLMR conditions and 45 cloned genes are listed in 
      catalogue available on the Internet. Traditionally, based on clinical presentation, 
      XLMR conditions were divided into specific and nonspecific forms or syndromic and 
      nonsyndromic. The distinction between specific and non-specific forms of XLMR is 
      gradually becoming less clear and spectrum of phenotypic variability is very large 
      as both syndromic and nonsyndromic forms have been described for several of the XLMR 
      genes. Mutations in patients suffering from X-linked mental retardation genes have 
      been found only in a relatively limited number of cases. Up to 50% of the patients 
      from XLMR families might have mutations in one of the known genes implicated in XLMR 
      so far. However, current methods are generally too expensive or too unreliable to 
      justify mutation screening of all known XLMR genes in diagnostic testing. Thus it is 
      necessary to use empirical data of recurrence risk in genetic counseling of the 
      family with mental retardation.

TI  - Heterozygous ANKRD17 loss-of-function variants cause a syndrome with intellectual 
      disability, speech delay, and dysmorphism.

AB  - ANKRD17 is an ankyrin repeat-containing protein thought to play a role in cell cycle 
      progression, whose ortholog in Drosophila functions in the Hippo pathway as a 
      co-factor of Yorkie. Here, we delineate a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by de 
      novo heterozygous ANKRD17 variants. The mutational spectrum of this cohort of 34 
      individuals from 32 families is highly suggestive of haploinsufficiency as the 
      underlying mechanism of disease, with 21 truncating or essential splice site 
      variants, 9 missense variants, 1 in-frame insertion-deletion, and 1 microdeletion 
      (1.16 Mb). Consequently, our data indicate that loss of ANKRD17 is likely the main 
      cause of phenotypes previously associated with large multi-gene chromosomal 
      aberrations of the 4q13.3 region. Protein modeling suggests that most of the 
      missense variants disrupt the stability of the ankyrin repeats through alteration of 
      core structural residues. The major phenotypic characteristic of our cohort is a 
      variable degree of developmental delay/intellectual disability, particularly 
      affecting speech, while additional features include growth failure, feeding 
      difficulties, non-specific MRI abnormalities, epilepsy and/or abnormal EEG, 
      predisposition to recurrent infections (mostly bacterial), ophthalmological 
      abnormalities, gait/balance disturbance, and joint hypermobility. Moreover, many 
      individuals shared similar dysmorphic facial features. Analysis of single-cell 
      RNA-seq data from the developing human telencephalon indicated ANKRD17 expression at 
      multiple stages of neurogenesis, adding further evidence to the assertion that 
      damaging ANKRD17 variants cause a neurodevelopmental disorder.

TI  - [Monogenic causes of X-linked mental retardation].
PG  - S45-9
AB  - INTRODUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT: The term X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) refers to 
      a heterogeneous group of conditions that, on the basis of their presenting symptoms, 
      have traditionally been classified as being syndromic (SMR) and non-syndromic or 
      non-specific (XMR). The prevalence of XLMR in males is estimated to be 10%, 
      excluding fragile X syndrome, which is the most common monogenic cause. There are 
      over 100 genes involved in XLMR. In this work we review some of the phenotypes and 
      genes involved in SMR. A small stature and coarse features indicate a suspected case 
      of Coffin-Lowry syndrome, which is secondary to mutations of the RPS6KA3 or RSK2 
      genes. Cerebellar hypoplasia points towards alterations of the OPHN1 gene. In males 
      with coarse features and genital abnormalities screening for alpha thalassemia must 
      be carried out; this association results from mutations in the ATRX gene. Of the 
      genes involved in mental retardation and epilepsy, the most notable are SLC6A8 
      (which triggers a deficit in creatine transport when altered and which is easily 
      detected with respect to its biochemistry) and ARX (also associated to lissencephaly 
      and dystonia of the hands). Mutations in the PQBP1 and JARID1C genes have been 
      identified in patients with mental retardation associated to microcephaly and short 
      stature. A high level of T3 hormone points towards defects in the SLC16A2 gene. Some 
      of these genes have also been implicated in XMR, which makes this distinction less 
      clear molecularly speaking. CONCLUSIONS: Systematic screening of all the genes 
      involved in XLMR is not possible in clinical praxis today. It is important to search 
      for differential phenotypic features in males with mental retardation that guide the 
      study towards specific genes. Identification of the molecular defect will allow for 
      correct genetic counselling. DNA microarrays for the study of different mutations in 
      a large number of genes involved in mental retardation are the great hope for the 
      future.

      registry.
PG  - 506-13
AB  - Nonspecific mental retardation (i.e., mental retardation with no known etiology) at 
      all levels of functioning was investigated in the population of British Columbia, 
      with ascertainment through the British Columbia Health Surveillance Registry. The 
      age-specific prevalence of nonspecific retardation for the 15- to 29-year age group, 
      where ascertainment was best, was 4.4 per 1,000 population at year-end 1978. A 
      minimum incidence of 5.2 per 1,000 male live births and 4.0 per 1,000 female live 
      births was calculated for the 1952-1965 birth cohort. Data on the number of cases 
      associated with either microcephalus, hydrocephalus, epilepsy, or cerebral palsy 
      were presented. Seventy-three percent of the cases with mild mental retardation had 
      no associated disability, whereas only 26.9 percent of profoundly retarded cases 
      were without any of these conditions. Survival rates varied with respect to the 
      level of mental retardation.

PG  - 422-34
LID - 10.1038/sj.ejhg.5201994 [doi]
AB  - X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) is a common cause of inherited intellectual 
      disability with an estimated prevalence of approximately 1/1000 males. Most XLMR 
      conditions are inherited as X-linked recessive traits, although female carriers may 
      manifest usually milder symptoms. We have listed 215 XLMR conditions, subdivided 
      according to their clinical presentation: 149 with specific clinical findings, 
      including 98 syndromes and 51 neuromuscular conditions, and 66 nonspecific (MRX) 
      forms. We also present a map of the 82 XLMR genes cloned to date (November 2007) and 
      a map of the 97 conditions that have been positioned by linkage analysis or 
      cytogenetic breakpoints. We briefly consider the molecular function of known XLMR 
      proteins and discuss the possible strategies to identify the remaining XLMR genes. 
      Final remarks are made on the natural history of XLMR conditions and on diagnostic 
      issues.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The genetic cause of intellectual disability in most patients is unclear 
      because of the absence of morphological clues, information about the position of 
      such genes, and suitable screening methods. Our aim was to identify de-novo variants 
      in individuals with sporadic non-syndromic intellectual disability. METHODS: In this 
      study, we enrolled children with intellectual disability and their parents from ten 
      centres in Germany and Switzerland. We compared exome sequences between patients and 
      their parents to identify de-novo variants. 20 children and their parents from the 
      KORA Augsburg Diabetes Family Study were investigated as controls. FINDINGS: We 
      enrolled 51 participants from the German Mental Retardation Network. 45 (88%) 
      participants in the case group and 14 (70%) in the control group had de-novo 
      variants. We identified 87 de-novo variants in the case group, with an exomic 
      mutation rate of 1·71 per individual per generation. In the control group we 
      identified 24 de-novo variants, which is 1·2 events per individual per generation. 
      More participants in the case group had loss-of-function variants than in the 
      control group (20/51 vs 2/20; p=0·022), suggesting their contribution to disease 
      development. 16 patients carried de-novo variants in known intellectual disability 
      genes with three recurrently mutated genes (STXBP1, SYNGAP1, and SCN2A). We deemed 
      at least six loss-of-function mutations in six novel genes to be disease causing. We 
      also identified several missense alterations with potential pathogenicity. 
      INTERPRETATION: After exclusion of copy-number variants, de-novo point mutations and 
      small indels are associated with severe, sporadic non-syndromic intellectual 
      disability, accounting for 45-55% of patients with high locus heterogeneity. 
      Autosomal recessive inheritance seems to contribute little in the outbred population 
      investigated. The large number of de-novo variants in known intellectual disability 
      genes is only partially attributable to known non-specific phenotypes. Several 
      patients did not meet the expected syndromic manifestation, suggesting a strong bias 
      in present clinical syndrome descriptions. FUNDING: German Ministry of Education and 
      Research, European Commission 7th Framework Program, and Swiss National Science

TI  - Metabolic disorders and mental retardation.
PG  - 31-41
AB  - The metabolic and anatomical substrate of most forms of mental retardation is not 
      known. Because the basis of normal brain function is not sufficiently understood, 
      the basis of abnormal function is understood poorly. Even in disorders where the 
      fundamental biochemical defect is known, such as phenylketonuria (PKU) and other 
      enzyme defects, the exact basis for brain dysfunction is uncertain. The outcome for 
      treated PKU, galactosemia, homocystinuria, and lysosomal disorders is not yet 
      optimal. The various forms of nonketotic hyperglycinemia often respond poorly to 
      current therapy. Less familiar disorders, with or without seizures, such as 
      deficient synthesis of serine or creatine and impaired glucose transport into the 
      brain, and disorders with variable malformations, such as Smith-Lemli-Opitz (SLO) 
      syndrome and the congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDGs), may initially be 
      thought to be a nonspecific form of developmental delay. Less familiar disorders, 
      with or without seizures and disorders with variable malformations may initially be 
      thought to be a nonspecific form of developmental delay. Simple tests of urine, 
      blood, and cerebrospinal fluid may lead to a diagnosis, accurate genetic counseling, 
      and better treatment. Metabolic brain imaging (magnetic resonance spectroscopy 
      (MRS)) has also helped to reveal biochemical abnormalities within the brain.

TI  - No association between polymorphisms in the FACL4 (fatty acid-CoA ligase 4) gene and 
      nonspecific mental retardation in Qin-Ba mountain region of China.
PG  - 197-200
LID - 10.1016/j.neulet.2008.05.072 [doi]
AB  - Mental retardation (MR) is a common form of cognitive impairment among children. The 
      underlying causes of mental retardation are extremely heterogeneous and include 
      significant genetic factors. Long chain fatty acid-CoA ligase 4 is the first gene 
      shown to be involved in mental retardation and fatty-acid metabolism. FACL4 gene 
      mutations in three Italian MR pedigrees have been reported as causing non-specific 
      mental retardation. To investigate the possible genetic contribution of the FACL4 
      gene to non-specific mental retardation children of the Qin-Ba mountain region in 
      China we performed an association study of 556 subjects (118 NSMR, 116 borderline 
      NSMR, and 322 controls) from the Han children of northwestern China using five 
      common SNPs (rs5943427, rs12856122, rs5943418, rs7886473, and rs10126612) in the 
      gene. No significant differences of genotypes and alleles frequencies from each 
      single SNP between NSMR and controls were observed. Pairwise linkage disequilibrium 
      analysis showed that four SNPs rs5943427, rs12856122, rs5943418, and rs7886473 were 
      in strong linkage disequilibrium; therefore, a haplotype analysis was performed. 
      However, there were no any significant differences in haplotype distributions 
      between cases and controls. In conclusion, we have found no evidence for the FACL4 
      gene conferring susceptibility on non-specific mental retardation children of the 
      Qin-Ba mountain region in China.

TI  - X-linked mental retardation (XLMR): from clinical conditions to cloned genes.
PG  - 117-58
AB  - X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) is a heterogenous set of conditions responsible 
      for a large proportion of inherited mental retardation. Approximately 200 XLMR 
      conditions and 45 cloned genes are now listed in our catalogue on the Internet at 
      http://xlmr.interfree.it/home.htm. Traditionally, XLMR conditions were subdivided 
      into specific (MRXS) and nonspecific (MRX) forms, depending on their clinical 
      presentation. Now that a growing number of candidate genes have become available for 
      screening XLMR families and patients, this distinction is becoming less useful and 
      similar conditions that had been previously listed as separate can now be grouped 
      together because different mutations in the same gene have been identified. 
      Furthermore, different mutations in the same XLMR gene may account for diseases of 
      increasing severity, but can also cause different phenotypes. As the functions of 
      proteins corresponding to these genes are characterized, biological networks 
      involved in causing mental retardation and conversely in supporting normal 
      intellectual functioning will be discovered. Molecular biologists and 
      neurobiologists will need to cooperate in order to verify the effects of XLMR gene 
      mutations in the context of neuronal circuitry. Eventually, DNA and protein 
      microarray technologies will assist researchers and physicians in reaching a 
      diagnosis even in small families or in individual patients with XLMR.

AB  - We provide a comprehensive list of all known forms of X-linked mental retardation. 
      It comprises 127 entries, subdivided into 5 categories (syndromes, dominant 
      disorders, metabolic disorders, neuromuscular disorders, and nonspecific mental 
      retardation). Map location of 69 putative loci demonstrates several overlaps, which 
      will only be resolved by more refined mapping or cloning of the respective genes. 
      The ultimate goal of identifying all the genes on the X chromosome whose mutations 
      cause mental retardation will require a concerted effort between clinical and 
      molecular investigators.

TI  - Novel mental retardation-epilepsy syndrome linked to Xp21.1-p11.4.
PG  - 45-50
AB  - We evaluated a kindred with X-linked mental retardation and epilepsy. Seven affected 
      males with mild to moderate mental retardation developed seizures (primarily 
      generalized, tonic-clonic, and atonic) that began on average at 6.8 months of age 
      (range, 4 to 14 months). These patients did not have a history of infantile spasms. 
      There were no dysmorphic features. Other than mental retardation, the neurological 
      examination was unremarkable, with exception of 2 affected subjects who had mild 
      generalized rigidity and ataxia. We identified tight linkage to a group of markers 
      on Xp21.1-p11.4. A maximum two-point LOD score of +3.83 at straight theta = 0 was 
      obtained for markers DXS8090, DXS1069, DXS8102, and DXS8085. This locus spans 7.7cM 
      between DXS1049 and DXS8054 and does not overlap the locus for X-linked West 
      syndrome. The tetraspanin gene, implicated in nonspecific mental retardation, is 
      mapped to this region. We sequenced the tetraspanin coding sequence in subjects with 
      X-linked mental retardation and epilepsy and did not identify disease-specific 
      mutations. The syndrome we describe, designated X-linked mental retardation and 
      epilepsy, is clinically and genetically distinct from X-linked West syndrome and 
      other X-linked mental retardation-epilepsy syndromes.

TI  - XLMR genes: update 1998.
PG  - 237-47
AB  - Since the Seventh Fragile X and XLMR Mental Retardation (XLMR) Workshop in 1995, the 
      genes for Coffin-Lowry, Mohr-Tranebjaerg, and Opitz G/BBB syndromes have been 
      cloned. Jensen syndrome has been found to be allelic to Mohr-Tranebjaerg. Twenty new 
      XLMR syndromes and metabolic or neuromuscular disorders have been reported. 
      Twenty-four new localizations have been established, including five in previously 
      reported conditions (FG, Carpenter, Arts, OPA2, and OFD1). The number of families 
      with nonspecific XLMR that have been reported has continued to increase; 58 families 
      or loci are now known. Eighteen new families with nonspecific mental retardation 
      (MRX) have been reported. Two of them, however, were subsequently found to have 
      mutations in the RABGDIA gene, which codes for a GDP-dissociation inhibitor for RAB 
      proteins. In total, 41 more entries have been added to the X chromosome map of XLMR. 
      The total number of known syndromes and MRX families has increased to 178. Of the 
      120 known XLMR disorders, 53 have been mapped, and 22 have been cloned. Assuming 
      that at least 10 loci are necessary to account for the 58 families with MRX, the 
      total number of XLMR loci counted so far would be 130. Although it is likely that 
      many of the disorders will eventually prove to be allelic, it is not possible at 
      present to determine the precise number of loci for nonspecific XLMR.

TI  - FRAXE and mental retardation.
PG  - 162-9
AB  - Mental impairment and instability of the CCG repeat at FRAXE is described in six 
      kindreds. Cosegregation of FRAXA and FRAXE was found within one of these kindreds. 
      Cytogenetic expression of FRAXE was shown to skip a generation when associated with 
      a reduction in size of the CCG expansion when transmitted through a male; however, 
      in general, transmission occurred through females and a copy number increased from 
      one generation to the next. In these respects the behaviour of FRAXE paralleled that 
      of FRAXA. A relationship between FRAXE and non-specific mental impairment is 
      strongly suggested by the occurrence in these families of more mentally impaired 
      male and female carriers, after removal of index cases, than could reasonably be 
      expected by chance.

TI  - FRAXA and FRAXE prevalence in patients with nonspecific mental retardation in the 
      Hellenic population.
PG  - 103-9
AB  - Mutations at FRAXA and FRAXE loci are due to expansions of a CGG trinucleotide 
      repeat and are characterized by mental retardation. Here we report a pilot screening 
      survey by means of cytogenetic and molecular methods of 433 unrelated retarded 
      individuals and their parents of Hellenic origin coming from various parts of Greece 
      and Cyprus. The purpose of the study was to estimate the frequency of FRAXA mutation 
      in individuals with nonspecific mental retardation without family history and 
      phenotypic stigmata in the Hellenic population. Five FRAXA-positive children (1.15%) 
      were identified, of whom four were found to carry a full mutation and one a 
      premutation. Furthermore we present preliminary data on a screening of FRAXE 
      mutation frequency. We screened 257 male patients with nonspecific mental 
      retardation, finding none positive for FRAXE mutation.

TI  - De novo SMARCA2 variants clustered outside the helicase domain cause a new 
      recognizable syndrome with intellectual disability and blepharophimosis distinct 
      from Nicolaides-Baraitser syndrome.
PG  - 1838-1850
LID - 10.1038/s41436-020-0898-y [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Nontruncating variants in SMARCA2, encoding a catalytic subunit of SWI/SNF 
      chromatin remodeling complex, cause Nicolaides-Baraitser syndrome (NCBRS), a 
      condition with intellectual disability and multiple congenital anomalies. Other 
      disorders due to SMARCA2 are unknown. METHODS: By next-generation sequencing, we 
      identified candidate variants in SMARCA2 in 20 individuals from 18 families with a 
      syndromic neurodevelopmental disorder not consistent with NCBRS. To stratify variant 
      interpretation, we functionally analyzed SMARCA2 variants in yeasts and performed 
      transcriptomic and genome methylation analyses on blood leukocytes. RESULTS: Of 20 
      individuals, 14 showed a recognizable phenotype with recurrent features including 
      epicanthal folds, blepharophimosis, and downturned nasal tip along with variable 
      degree of intellectual disability (or blepharophimosis intellectual disability 
      syndrome [BIS]). In contrast to most NCBRS variants, all SMARCA2 variants associated 
      with BIS are localized outside the helicase domains. Yeast phenotype assays 
      differentiated NCBRS from non-NCBRS SMARCA2 variants. Transcriptomic and DNA 
      methylation signatures differentiated NCBRS from BIS and those with nonspecific 
      phenotype. In the remaining six individuals with nonspecific dysmorphic features, 
      clinical and molecular data did not permit variant reclassification. CONCLUSION: We 
      identified a novel recognizable syndrome named BIS associated with clustered de novo 
      SMARCA2 variants outside the helicase domains, phenotypically and molecularly 
      distinct from NCBRS.

TI  - A gene for dominant nonspecific X-linked mental retardation is located in Xq28.
PG  - 903-9
AB  - A large family (MRX48) with a nonspecific X-linked mental retardation condition is 
      described. An X-linked semidominant inheritance is suggested by the segregation in 
      three generations of a moderate to severe mental retardation in seven males and by a 
      milder intellectual impairment in two females, without any specific clinical, 
      radiological, or biological feature. Two-point linkage analysis demonstrated 
      significant linkage between the disorder and several markers in Xq28 (maximum LOD 
      score [Zmax] = 2.71 at recombination fraction [theta] = 0); multipoint linkage 
      analyses confirmed the significant linkage with a Zmax of 3.3 at theta = 0, at 
      DXS1684. A recombination event observed with the flanking marker DXS8011 delineates 
      a locus between this marker and the telomere. The approximate length of this locus 
      is 8-9 cM, corresponding to 5.5-6 Mb. In an attempt to explain the variable 
      intellectual impairment in females, we examined X-chromosome inactivation in all 
      females of the family. Inactivation patterns in lymphocytes were random or 
      moderately skewed, and no correlation between the phenotypic status and a specific 
      inactivation pattern was observed. The interval of assignment noted in this family 
      overlaps with five MRX loci previously reported in Xq28.

TI  - Mutations of the UPF3B gene, which encodes a protein widely expressed in neurons, 
      are associated with nonspecific mental retardation with or without autism.
PG  - 767-76
LID - 10.1038/mp.2009.14 [doi]
AB  - Mutations in the UPF3B gene, which encodes a protein involved in nonsense-mediated 
      mRNA decay, have recently been described in four families with specific (Lujan-Fryns 
      and FG syndromes), nonspecific X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) and autism. To 
      further elucidate the contribution of UPF3B to mental retardation (MR), we screened 
      its coding sequence in 397 families collected by the EuroMRX consortium. We 
      identified one nonsense mutation, c.1081C>T/p.Arg361(*), in a family with 
      nonspecific MR (MRX62) and two amino-acid substitutions in two other, unrelated 
      families with MR and/or autism (c.1136G>A/p.Arg379His and c.1103G>A/p.Arg368Gln). 
      Functional studies using lymphoblastoid cell lines from affected patients revealed 
      that c.1081C>T mutation resulted in UPF3B mRNA degradation and consequent absence of 
      the UPF3B protein. We also studied the subcellular localization of the wild-type and 
      mutated UPF3B proteins in mouse primary hippocampal neurons. We did not detect any 
      obvious difference in the localization between the wild-type UPF3B and the proteins 
      carrying the two missense changes identified. However, we show that UPF3B is widely 
      expressed in neurons and also presents in dendritic spines, which are essential 
      structures for proper neurotransmission and thus learning and memory processes. Our 
      results demonstrate that in addition to Lujan-Fryns and FG syndromes, UPF3B protein 
      truncation mutations can cause also nonspecific XLMR. We also identify comorbidity 
      of MR and autism in another family with UPF3B mutation. The neuronal localization 
      pattern of the UPF3B protein and its function in mRNA surveillance suggests a 
      potential function in the regulation of the expression and degradation of various 
      mRNAs present at the synapse.

TI  - Nomenclature guidelines for X-linked mental retardation.
PG  - 383-91
AB  - Nomenclature guidelines are proposed for non-specific and for syndromal forms of 
      X-linked mental retardation. Non-specific mental retardations (MRX) are given unique 
      symbols for each family (MRX1, MRX2, MRX3 ...). Syndromal mental retardations (MRXS) 
      which do not as yet have specific symbols are given unique interim symbols for each 
      syndrome (MRXS1, MRXS2, MRXS3 ...). The prerequisite for assignment of serial MRX 
      and MRXS gene symbols is a minimum lod score (or multipoint lod score) of +2 between 
      the MR locus and one or more X chromosome markers. Prior approval of availability 
      for proposed gene symbols must be obtained from the Nomenclature Committee of the 
      Human Gene Mapping Workshops.

TI  - Positive association of neuroligin-4 gene with nonspecific mental retardation in the 
      Qinba Mountains Region of China.
PG  - 1-5
LID - 10.1097/YPG.0b013e3283088e54 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Neuroligin-4 is essential for proper brain function. Some studies 
      indicate a close relationship between neuroligin-4 and several human psychiatric 
      conditions. METHODS: The case-control method was used to study the association 
      between nonspecific mental retardation (NSMR) and genetic variants of neuroligin-4 
      gene (NLGN4). Five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs: rs5916271, rs7049300, 
      rs6638575, rs3810686, and rs1882260) were genotyped by PCR-RFLP/SSCP method in the 
      NLGN4. RESULTS: Individual SNP analysis shows significant differences at SNPs 
      rs3810686 and rs1882260 for allele frequency when NSMR cases and controls [odds 
      ratio (OR)=1.589, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.035-2.438, chi2=4.53, df=1, 
      P=0.033; OR=2.050, 95% CI=1.211-3.470, chi2=7.38, df=1, P=0.007, respectively] were 
      compared. Further haplotype analysis indicates that there are two haplotype sets, 
      rs3810686-rs1882260 and rs6638575-rs3810686-rs1882260, which show statistical 
      differences between NSMR cases and controls (chi2=6.79, df=2, global P=0.034; 
      chi2=9.29, df=2, global P=0.0096, respectively). CONCLUSION: The results suggest a 
      positive association between the genetic variants of the NLGN4 and NSMR in the 
      Chinese children from Qinba Mountains Region.

TI  - [Genetics of mental retardation].
PG  - 218-22
AB  - Mentally retarded patients can be grouped in two categories: severe forms seen in 4 
      of every thousand live births and mild forms that occur approximately five times 
      more often. Approximately half of severe cases of mental retardation are genetically 
      determined, and half of these fall under the category of X-linked mental retardation 
      (XLMR) disease. The XLMR group is currently comprised of 105 highly varied types of 
      retardation that can be associated with a fragile X chromosome, biochemical defect, 
      neurologic alterations, bony dysplasia and a range of malformations. Along with such 
      syndromes (which are specific), some 40 familial XLMR entities (nonspecific) can be 
      identified in which mental retardation is the only sign. Cytogenetic testing to 
      identify dysmorphic syndromes caused by chromosomal disease and molecular biology 
      studies are indispensable for identifying the genes responsible for XLMR syndromes. 
      Healthy carriers can also be found. It thus becomes possible to provide appropriate 
      genetic counseling for families and to achieve a prenatal diagnosis in some cases.

TI  - Linkage analysis in three families with nonspecific X-linked mental retardation.
PG  - 137-46
AB  - Nonspecific X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) is a common disorder. The number of 
      genes involved in this condition is not known, but it is estimated to be more than 
      10. We present a clinical and linkage study on 3 families with XLMR. All families 
      were analyzed using highly polymorphic markers covering the X chromosome; screening 
      for the fragile X mutation was negative. The first family (MRX 36) consisted of 1 
      female and 4 male patients in 3 generations and 7 healthy individuals. Considering 
      the female as an expressing heterozygous carrier, a maximum LOD score of 3.41 was 
      reached in region Xp21.2-Xp22.1. Considering her phenotype to be unknown, a LODmax 
      of 1.97 was reached in the same region. The second family consisted of 5 affected 
      and 6 healthy males with mild to borderline mental retardation. Linkage analysis 
      using an X-linked recessive model with full penetrance and no phenocopies excluded 
      linkage over almost the entire X chromosome. Using alternative models, including an 
      affecteds-only analysis, a LODmax of 1.49 was found in region Xq24-28. The third 
      family, consisting of 4 male patients with moderate mental retardation in 1 
      generation yielded a LODmax of 0.9 in region Xp22.13-11.3. However, even in this 
      small pedigree, exclusion mapping was able to exclude very large parts of the X 
      chromosome and in this way identify a likely candidate region.

PG  - 290-4
AB  - Nonspecific X-linked mental retardation (MRX) includes several distinct entities 
      with mental retardation but without additional distinguishing features. The MRX 
      family reported here has been classified previously as MRX9. In this study, we 
      performed linkage analysis of MRX9 with a panel of 43 polymorphic DNA markers 
      dispersed over chromosome X. Two-point linkage analysis revealed lod scores of 3.52 
      and 3.82 at 0% recombination for OATL1 and MAOA, both located in Xp11.2-p11.4. Lod 
      scores for linkage with PGK1P1, DXS106, and DXS132, all located in Xq11-q13, were 
      3.83, 3.82, and 3.52, respectively, all at 0% recombination. Multipoint linkage 
      analysis showed two peaks with MAOA and DXS132/DXS106, respectively. Analysis of 
      recombinational events indicated a position of the MRX9 gene between DXS164 and 
      DXS453. These findings are compatible with a location of the MRX9 gene in the 
      pericentromeric region of the X chromosome at Xp21-q13.

TI  - Missense mutation in PAK3, R67C, causes X-linked nonspecific mental retardation.
PG  - 294-8
AB  - X-linked mental retardation is a very common condition that affects approximately 1 
      in 600 males. Despite recent progress, in most cases the molecular defects 
      underlying this disorder remain unknown. Recently, a study using the candidate gene 
      approach demonstrated the presence of mutations in PAK3 (p21-activating kinase) 
      associated with nonspecific mental retardation. PAK3 is a member of the larger 
      family of PAK genes. PAK proteins have been implicated as critical downstream 
      effectors that link Rho-GTPases to the actin cytoskeleton and to MAP kinase 
      cascades, including the c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38. We screened 12 
      MRX pedigrees that map to a large region overlying Xq21-q24. Mutation screening of 
      the whole coding region of the PAK3 gene was performed by using a combination of 
      denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and direct sequencing. We have identified a 
      novel missense mutation in exon 2 of PAK3 gene (R67C) in MRX47. This confirms the 
      involvement of PAK3 in MRX following the report of a nonsense mutation recently 
      reported in MRX30. In the MRX47 family, all affected males show moderate to severe 
      mental retardation. No seizures, statural growth deficiency, or minor facial or 
      other abnormal physical features were observed. This mutation R67C is located in a 
      conserved polybasic domain (AA 66-68) of the protein that is predicted to play a 
      major role in the GTPases binding and stimulation of Pak activity.

TI  - Identification of a family with nonspecific mental retardation (MRX79) with the 
      A140V mutation in the MECP2 gene: is there a need for routine screening?
PG  - 249-52
AB  - Mutations in the methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2) cause Rett syndrome, a severe 
      neurodevelopmental disorder occurring predominantly in females. Male patients with 
      Rett syndrome are extremely rare, as the Rett-causing mutations in the MECP2 gene 
      are usually lethal in hemizygous males. However, different mutations in the same 
      gene were reported to cause mental retardation, both in sporadic non-syndromic males 
      as well as in syndromic families with disease manifestation in carrier females. The 
      majority of the reported MECP2 mutations in mentally retarded patients cause amino 
      acid substitutions and, especially in isolated cases, discrimination between a 
      disease-causing mutation and a rare polymorphism is not obvious and the significance 
      of each individual variation should be verified. We mapped a new non-syndromic 
      X-linked family (MRX79) to the chromosomal region Xq27.3-Xq28 and identified an 
      A140V mutation in the MEPC2 gene in all patients with the disease haplotype. In 
      addition to data published by others, this suggests that A140V is a recurrent 
      mutation (and not a polymorphism) found in patients with X-linked mental 
      retardation.

TI  - The FMR2 gene, FRAXE and non-specific X-linked mental retardation: clinical and 
      molecular aspects.
PG  - 95-106
LID - 10.1017/S0003480000007983 [doi]
AB  - FRAXE fragile site associated mental retardation remains unique among X-linked 
      mental retardation phenotypes due to its very mild to borderline nature (50< IQ< 
      85). It is the most prevalent form of non-specific X-linked mental retardation so 
      far delineated, with an estimated incidence of at least 1/50-100,000 males, and with 
      more than 50 families known worldwide. The FRAXE site is within, or immediately 
      adjacent to, the 5' untranslated region of the FMR2 gene. Hyperexpansion of the 
      FRAXE CCG repeat silences transcription of the gene. The structure of FMR2 has been 
      characterized, but its function remains unknown. Gene localizations for numerous (> 
      75) large families with non-specific X-linked mental retardation (MRX) have been 
      determined so far. Recently the molecular basis for some of them has been unravelled 
      by identification of the responsible genes, which participate in complex common 
      signalling pathways. This review summarises the new data on FRAXE associated mental 
      retardation and the FMR2 gene in the light of the recent discoveries of new genes 
      responsible for other forms of non-specific X-linked mental retardation.

TI  - Linkage mapping of a nonspecific form of X-linked mental retardation (MRX53) in a 
      large Pakistani family.
PG  - 62-5
AB  - Nonspecific X-linked mental retardation is a nonprogressive, genetically 
      heterogeneous condition that affects cognitive function in the absence of other 
      distinctive clinical manifestations. We report here linkage data on a large 
      Pakistani family affected by a form of X-linked nonspecific mental retardation. X 
      chromosome genotyping of family members and linkage analysis allowed the 
      identification of a new disease locus, MRX53. The defined critical region spans 
      approximately 15 cM between DXS1210 and DXS1047 in Xq22.2-26. A LOD score value of 
      3.34 at no recombination was obtained with markers DXS1072 and DXS8081.

TI  - Inactivation of the CDKL3 gene at 5q31.1 by a balanced t(X;5) translocation 
      associated with nonspecific mild mental retardation.
PG  - 1267-79
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.a.32274 [doi]
AB  - We have investigated the breakpoints of a balanced reciprocal translocation between 
      chromosomes X and 5, [46,X,t(X;5)(p11.1;q31.1)], in a woman with mild mental 
      retardation (MR). Methylation studies showed a 100% skewed X-inactivation in 
      patient-derived lymphocytes. Cloning and sequencing of the junction fragment from 
      the X derivative showed that the breakpoint occurred in intron 3 of the CDKL3 gene 
      on chromosome 5 and in a region devoid of genes on chromosome X. Quantitative RT-PCR 
      analyses on patient-derived lymphoblastoid cells documented a significant 50% 
      decrease of the CDKL3 transcript level. Allelic expression analysis, using an 
      intronic SNP that was RT-PCR amplified from CDKL3 pre-mRNA, provided further 
      evidence that the CDKL3 gene was transcribed from only one allele. Decreased CDKL3 
      gene expression was definitively confirmed at the protein level by immunoblot 
      analysis. CDKL3 is a member of a subset of the cdc2-related protein kinase family 
      that shows similarity to both mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) and 
      cyclin-dependant kinases (cdks). Importantly, one member of the family, CDKL5, has 
      been implicated in atypical Rett syndrome, West syndrome, and X-linked infantile 
      spasm, all including MR as a manifestation. Expression studies demonstrated that the 
      mouse homologue, mCdkl3, was expressed in all brain regions investigated and 
      throughout mouse development, a pattern that is consistent with a role in 
      development and brain function. Together the data suggest that haploinsufficiency of 
      CDKL3 in the t(X;5) patient contributes to her phenotype, and that the CDKL3 gene is 
      a strong candidate for nonsyndromal autosomal dominant MR.

AB  - The high concordance for autism symptoms in monozygotic twin-pairs compared to 
      di-zygotic twins and/or non-twin sib-ships suggests a high genetic determinism in 
      autism. Those results have hypothesized multi-factorial determinism in accordance 
      with family studies and mathematical models. However, linkage and association or 
      candidate gene strategies have failed to-date to identify clearly involved 
      mechanisms. Mental retardation (MR) is known as frequently associated to autism. 
      Multiplex XLMR pedigrees have been reported with only one mutated patient having 
      autism and MR: different X-located MR genes have been shown to be involved (NLGN4, 
      MECP2, OPHN1, ZNF674 and FRAXA) which does not suggest that they could be "autism 
      genes". Tuberous sclerosis studies and report of numerous autosomal domains shown 
      deleted in MR-autistic subjects suggest that several autosomal dominant (AD) genes 
      could be also involved in MR with autism. Whereas multiplex AD-MR families are rare, 
      AD de novo mutations could explain numerous sporadic situations of non-specific MR 
      and of autism with MR, in accordance with twin studies. Finally, we hypothesize that 
      in those autistic subjects with mendelian MR, the XL-MR or AD-MR gene (G1) would 
      pave the way for a second Mendelian factor (G2) responsible for autism symptoms.

TI  - [Various genetic aspects of X-linked mental retardation].
PG  - 49-57
AB  - X-Linked Mental Retardation constitutes an important pathologic entity in genetics. 
      The overall significance, history and background of the concept of X-Linked mental 
      retardation is reviewed with a special mention to the cases referenced under the 
      term non-specific X-Linked mental retardation. The concept of lod-score has brought 
      some improvement in the clinical delineation of the X-Linked mental retardation 
      syndromes with some recent reports of suggestive linkage studies. The fragile-X 
      syndrome is discussed with a special focus on reports of X-linked mental retardation 
      with X chromosomal deletions or duplications. Linkage and molecular studies are 
      reported viewing genetic approaches based on restriction fragment length 
      polymorphisms. DNA probes spanning the length of the X and Y chromosomes which may 
      prove critical to the development of diagnostic tests are referred. Computer 
      assistance for a compilation of clinical findings in the X-linked mental retardation 
      syndromes is specified as a diagnostic review and assistance program to check on the 
      various entities. A joint collaborative investigation is reported to ascertain 
      families with X-linked mental retardation in order to develop direct and linkage 
      studies for the diagnosis of there disorders.

TI  - A gene for nonspecific X-linked mental retardation (MRX41) is located in the distal 
      segment of Xq28.
PG  - 131-3
AB  - We report on a family in which nonsyndromal mild to moderate mental retardation 
      segregates as an X-linked trait (MRX41). Two point linkage analysis demonstrated 
      linkage between the disorder and marker DXS3 in Xq21.33 with a lod score of 2.56 at 
      theta = 0.0 and marker DXS1108 in Xq28 with a lod score of 3.82 at theta = 0.0. 
      Multipoint linkage analysis showed that the odds for a location of the gene in Xq28 
      vs Xq21.33 are 100:1. This is the fourth family with non-specific X-linked mental 
      retardation with Xq28-qter as the most likely gene localization.

PG  - 263-6
AB  - Linkage analysis was performed in a family with nonspecific X-linked mental 
      retardation (MRX). Affected individuals had no clinical characteristics other than 
      mental retardation. Linkage was detected to the marker loci DXS477, DXS465, DXS52, 
      DXS15 and F8C with maximum lod scores of 1.70, 1.32, 2.52, 1.70, and 1.09, 
      respectively (theta = 0.0). The results strongly indicate that the gene for mental 
      retardation in the family studied maps close to DXS52.

TI  - [Gene mapping in 14 families with X-linked nonspecific mental retardation].
PG  - 94-113
AB  - Mental retardation affects 2-3% of the population. The identification of nonspecific 
      X-linked mental retardation genes represents a challenge of considerable medical and 
      scientific importance. AIM: An attempt to identify new genes and mutations in known 
      genes in 14 families with nonspecific X-linked mental retardation. MATERIAL AND 
      METHODS: Linkage analysis with microsatellite markers was performed in 14 families 
      with mental retardation segregating as an X-linked feature. Significant lod score (> 
      2) was obtained only for 2 families, due to insufficient number of analyzed 
      families' members. Known MRX genes located in the linkage intervals were analysed. 
      RESULTS: Analysis of selected known MRX genes enabled identification of pathogenic 
      mutations in 3 out of 14 families. Sequencing of further candidate genes is in 
      progress. In all families the critical region and the number of genes to analyze was 
      significantly narrowed. CONCLUSIONS: Linkage analysis in families with mental 
      retardation segregating as an X-linked feature is still a considerable approach 
      leading to identification of new genes, and mutations in known genes. It is a first 
      step of identification of disease background, even in small families with lod score 
      < 2.

TI  - 3q29 Microdeletion: a mental retardation disorder unassociated with a recognizable 
      phenotype in two mother-daughter pairs.
PG  - 1777-81
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.a.32965 [doi]
AB  - The 3q29 microdeletion syndrome (del 3q29) is a novel genomic disorder identified 
      after the introduction of microarray-based technology. The phenotype of the reported 
      patients is variable, including mental retardation and subtle facial anomalies. We 
      report on two mother-daughter pairs, heterozygous for 3q29, and review clinical 
      features of all known affected individuals. Del 3q29 syndrome is associated with 
      nonspecific clinical features, including mild-to-moderate developmental delay, 
      microcephaly, and mild facial dysmorphisms such as short philtrum and high nasal 
      bridge. Facial anomalies were nonoverlapping and nondistinct, also within each 
      mother-daughter pair. Parental transmission of del 3q29 could be more frequent than 
      previously considered. Malformations are rare, occurring only in single subjects. 
      The phenotypic diversity of affected patients and the lack of distinct dysmorphisms 
      suggest that this disorder cannot be recognized on clinical ground alone. Del 3q29 
      should be searched in subjects with unexplained mild/moderate mental retardation, 
      microcephaly, and minor nonspecific facial anomalies.

TI  - Mapping of MRX81 in Xp11.2-Xq12 suggests the presence of a new gene involved in 
      nonspecific X-linked mental retardation.
PG  - 217-22
AB  - X-linked nonspecific mental retardation (MRX) accounts for approximately 25% of 
      mental retardation in males. A number of MRX loci have been mapped on the X 
      chromosome, reflecting the complexity of gene action in central nervous system (CNS) 
      specification and function. Eleven MRX genes have been identified, but many other 
      causative loci remain to be refined to the single gene level. In 21 MRX families, 
      the causative gene is located in the pericentromeric region; and we report here the 
      identification by linkage analysis of a further such locus, MRX81. The new MRX locus 
      was identified by two- and multi-point parametric analysis carried out on a large 
      Italian family. Tight linkage of MRX81 to DNA markers ALAS2, DXS991, and DXS7132 was 
      observed with a maximum LOD score of 3.43. Haplotype construction delineates an 
      MRX81 critical region of 8 cM, the smallest MRX pericentromeric interval so far 
      described, between DXS1039 and DXS1216, and placing it in Xp11.2-Xq12. So far, 
      automated sequencing of two candidates in the region, the MRX gene oligophrenin 
      (OPHN1) and the brain-specific ephrinB1 (EFNB1) gene, in DNA from affected males 
      excluded their candidacy for MRX81, suggesting a novel disease gene.

TI  - [Diagnosis of genetic mental retardation. Protocol of study].
PG  - S103-7
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The study of mental retardation (MR) is one of the most complex fields 
      in human genetics, due to the fact that it presents a very high degree of clinical 
      and genetic heterogeneity, and both the genetic bases and the environmental factors 
      that act upon them are extremely complex. At the present time almost half of the 
      cases of MR remain undiagnosed. AIM. To present a protocol for laboratory work using 
      the technology that is currently available to reach a diagnosis of MR. DEVELOPMENT: 
      The first step is to evaluate the patient with a thorough clinical examination and 
      by obtaining information about the personal and family history. A suspected 
      diagnosis of one or several syndromes that involve MR must be confirmed, if 
      possible, in the laboratory with the appropriate technique. In cases of MR with no 
      clinical suspicion of any specific syndrome, three tests must be conducted: 
      karyotype, molecular study of the expansion of CGG in the FMR1 gene, and study of 
      the subtelomeric regions. If the study is negative and we are dealing with a 
      familial case with a suitable structure, a linkage study must be performed. As far 
      as sporadic cases are concerned, it is difficult to advance in a routine manner 
      although some tests allow screening several genes determinations to be carried out 
      on several genes at the same time. Other techniques permit to investigate in greater 
      depth, such as screening for genes responsible for non-specific X-linked MR or 
      CGH-arrays (arrays based on compared genomic hybridisation) for the whole genome or 
      for a particular chromosome. At the present time, however, such techniques are 
      limited to research projects or very special cases. CONCLUSIONS: We propose a study 
      protocol and highlight the importance of its use to obtain maximum performance in 
      order to reach a diagnosis that allows us to give genetic counselling and offer a 
      prenatal diagnosis for future generations.

TI  - Rho proteins, mental retardation and the cellular basis of cognition.
PG  - 191-9
AB  - For several decades, it has been known that mental retardation (MR) is associated 
      with abnormalities in dendrites and dendritic spines. The recent cloning of seven 
      genes that cause nonspecific MR when mutated provides important insights in the 
      cellular mechanisms that result in the dendritic abnormalities associated with MR. 
      Three of the encoded proteins, oligophrenin 1, PAK3 and alpha PIX, interact directly 
      with Rho GTPases. Rho GTPases are key signaling proteins that integrate 
      extracellular and intracellular signals to orchestrate coordinated changes in the 
      actin cytoskeleton essential for directed neurite outgrowth and the regulation of 
      synaptic connectivity. Although many details of the cell biology of Rho signaling in 
      the CNS are still unclear, a picture is unfolding showing how mutations that alter 
      Rho signaling result in abnormal neuronal connectivity and deficient cognitive 
      functioning in humans. Conversely, these findings illuminate the cellular mechanisms 
      underlying normal cognitive function.

TI  - Familial mental retardation syndrome ATR-16 due to an inherited cryptic subtelomeric 
      translocation, t(3;16)(q29;p13.3).
PG  - 16-25
AB  - In the search for genetic causes of mental retardation, we have studied a 
      five-generation family that includes 10 individuals in generations IV and V who are 
      affected with mild-to-moderate mental retardation and mild, nonspecific dysmorphic 
      features. The disease is inherited in a seemingly autosomal dominant fashion with 
      reduced penetrance. The pedigree is unusual because of (1) its size and (2) the fact 
      that individuals with the disease appear only in the last two generations, which is 
      suggestive of anticipation. Standard clinical and laboratory screening protocols and 
      extended cytogenetic analysis, including the use of high-resolution karyotyping and 
      multiplex FISH (M-FISH), could not reveal the cause of the mental retardation. 
      Therefore, a whole-genome scan was performed, by linkage analysis, with 
      microsatellite markers. The phenotype was linked to chromosome 16p13.3, and, 
      unexpectedly, a deletion of a part of 16pter was demonstrated in patients, similar 
      to the deletion observed in patients with ATR-16 syndrome. Subsequent FISH analysis 
      demonstrated that patients inherited a duplication of terminal 3q in addition to the 
      deletion of 16p. FISH analysis of obligate carriers revealed that a balanced 
      translocation between the terminal parts of 16p and 3q segregated in this family. 
      This case reinforces the role of cryptic (cytogenetically invisible) subtelomeric 
      translocations in mental retardation, which is estimated by others to be implicated 
      in 5%-10% of cases.

TI  - A member of a gene family on Xp22.3, VCX-A, is deleted in patients with X-linked 
      nonspecific mental retardation.
PG  - 563-73
AB  - X-linked nonspecific mental retardation (MRX) has a frequency of 0.15% in the male 
      population and is caused by defects in several different genes on the human X 
      chromosome. Genotype-phenotype correlations in male patients with a partial 
      nullisomy of the X chromosome have suggested that at least one locus involved in MRX 
      is on Xp22.3. Previous deletion mapping has shown that this gene resides between 
      markers DXS1060 and DXS1139, a region encompassing approximately 1.5 Mb of DNA. 
      Analyzing the DNA of 15 males with Xp deletions, we were able to narrow this MRX 
      critical interval to approximately 15 kb of DNA. Only one gene, VCX-A (variably 
      charged, X chromosome mRNA on CRI-S232A), was shown to reside in this interval. 
      Because of a variable number of tandem 30-bp repeats in the VCX-A gene, the size of 
      the predicted protein is 186-226 amino acids. VCX-A belongs to a gene family 
      containing at least four nearly identical paralogues on Xp22.3 (VCX-A, -B, -B1, and 
      -C) and two on Yq11.2 (VCY-D, VCY-E), suggesting that the X and Y copies were 
      created by duplication events. We have found that VCX-A is retained in all patients 
      with normal intelligence and is deleted in all patients with mental retardation. 
      There is no correlation between the presence or absence of VCX-B1, -B, and VCX-C and 
      mental status in our patients. These results suggest that VCX-A is sufficient to 
      maintain normal mental development.

TI  - FRAXA screening in Brazilian institutionalized individuals with nonspecific severe 
      mental retardation.
PG  - 283-7
AB  - Individuals with mental disabilities are a heterogeneous group, mainly when we 
      consider the etiology of mental retardation (MR). Recent advances in molecular 
      genetics techniques have enabled us to unveil more about the molecular basis of 
      several genetic syndromes associated with MR. In this study, we surveyed 85 
      institutionalized individuals with severe MR, 38 males and 47 females, by two 
      molecular techniques, to detect CGG amplifications in the FMR1 gene. No FRAXA 
      mutations were found in the FMR1 gene, reinforcing the low prevalence of Fragile X 
      syndrome among institutionalized individuals with severe MR. We considered the PCR 
      protocol used adequate for screening males with mental retardation of unknown 
      etiology. The use of the Southern blot is still necessary for the decisive diagnosis 
      of the Fragile X syndrome. To exclude chromosomal abnormalities associated with MR 
      as a possible cause of the phenotype in these individuals, G-banded chromosome 
      analysis was performed in all patients and 7.3% of chromosomal aberrations were 
      found. Our results are similar to those reported previously and point to the 
      necessity of expanding the molecular investigation toward other causes of MR, such 
      as subtle chromosomal rearrangements, as suggested recent by a combination of 
      fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and PCR studies.

TI  - Molecular basis of X-linked non-specific mental retardation.
PG  - 549-57
AB  - Mental retardation (MR) is a common disorder, affecting 1-3% of the total 
      population. This condition results from failure to develop cognitive abilities and 
      intelligence level appropriate for the age group. Mental retardation is basically a 
      clinically as well as etiologically heterogeneous type of condition and both genetic 
      and non-genetic factors have been found to be involved. There are more than 1000 
      entries in Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database under the name of 
      mental retardation. In recent years 15 genes for X linked non-specific mental 
      retardation have been identified which provide important clues regarding molecular 
      and cellular processes involved in signal transduction cascade in central nervous 
      system. Recent advancements in identification and characterization of X-linked 
      non-specific mental retardation genes have been discussed in this review. 
      Understanding of the molecular pathways of disease causing genes would be helpful in 
      developing effective therapeutic approaches for mental retardation.

AB  - Etiology-specific profiles of intellectual abilities were compared in three groups 
      of males with mental retardation using the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children 
      (K-ABC). Subjects included 10 males with fragile X syndrome, 10 with Down syndrome, 
      and 10 with nonspecific mental retardation who were equated on both mental and 
      chronological age. Across all three groups, sequential processing was lower than 
      simultaneous processing or achievement, and particular subtests (e.g., Gestalt 
      Closure) were relative strengths. Although boys with Down syndrome showed less 
      extreme patterns of domain strengths and weaknesses, they showed a significant 
      strength in the Sequential Processing Hand Movements subtest. In contrast, the Hand 
      Movements subtest was lowest of all K-ABC subtests for males with fragile X 
      syndrome. Implications were discussed for more fine-tuned research and intervention 
      efforts.

PG  - 228-37
AB  - Although some genetic, mental retardation syndromes have well-described behavioral 
      features, comparative studies have not yet assessed the relative uniqueness of these 
      so-called phenotypes. Maladaptive behavior of 43 children with Prader-Willi syndrome 
      was compared to age- and gender-matched children with Down syndrome and with 
      nonspecific mental retardation. The Prader-Willi group showed more frequent and 
      severe internalizing, externalizing, and total problem behaviors on the Child 
      Behavior Checklist. Some problems were elevated in all groups, and 12 behaviors were 
      significantly elevated in Prader-Willi subjects relative to both comparison groups. 
      Seven behaviors predicted membership into the Prader-Willi group with 91% accuracy. 
      Implications were discussed for research on behavioral phenotypes in general and for 
      dual diagnosis in particular.

TI  - XLMR database.
PG  - 202-5
AB  - The computer database on X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) disorders developed by 
      Arena and Lubs in 1991 has now been updated to include all currently known XLMR 
      disorders and nonspecific (MRX) families. Currently, it includes 123 syndromes, 59 
      nonspecific XLMR families, and 60 families from the Miami/Greenwood study. The older 
      clinical reports have been reviewed and revised. The search mechanism has also been 
      revised and now includes 740 individual "keywords." Each of these keywords 
      recognizes several of clinical descriptive terms, as used in published literature 
      reports. Searches can be made according to any clinical finding or combination of 
      findings. For each disorder, the database presents a graphic display that contains a 
      revised and more complete set of clinical findings, references, keywords, map 
      localization, molecular information, access to pictures, and OMIM number.

TI  - Recurrent infections, hypotonia, and mental retardation caused by duplication of 
      MECP2 and adjacent region in Xq28.
PG  - e1687-95
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to describe the neurologic and clinical features of affected 
      males from families with X-linked patterns of severe mental retardation, hypotonia, 
      recurrent respiratory infection, and microduplication of Xq28 that consistently 
      includes the MECP2 (methyl-CpG binding protein 2) gene. STUDY DESIGN: To identify 
      duplications, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification of the MECP2 gene was 
      performed on male probands from families with X-linked mental retardation. The males 
      either had linkage to Xq28 or had a phenotype consistent with previous reports 
      involving Xq28 functional disomy. After detection of a duplication of MECP2, 
      additional family members were tested to confirm the MECP2 duplication segregated 
      with the affected phenotype, and X-inactivation studies were performed on carrier 
      females. RESULTS: Six families with multiple affected males having MECP2 
      duplications were identified by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, 
      and the carrier mothers were subsequently shown to have highly skewed X 
      inactivation. In 5 of 6 families, the microduplication extended proximally to 
      include the L1 cell adhesion molecule gene. The primary clinical features associated 
      with this microduplication are infantile hypotonia, recurrent respiratory infection, 
      severe mental retardation, absence of speech development, seizures, and spasticity. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Although many of the phenotypic features of our patients are rather 
      nonspecific in cohorts of individuals with syndromic and nonsyndromic mental 
      retardation, the proneness to infection is quite striking because the patients had 
      normal growth and were not physically debilitated. Although the etiology of the 
      infections is not understood, we recommend considering MECP2 dosage studies and a 
      genetics referral in individuals with severe developmental delay and neurologic 
      findings, especially when a history of recurrent respiratory ailments has been 
      documented.

TI  - A mutation hot spot for nonspecific X-linked mental retardation in the MECP2 gene 
      causes the PPM-X syndrome.
PG  - 1034-7
AB  - We report here the genetic cause of the X-linked syndrome of psychosis, pyramidal 
      signs, and macro-orchidism (PPM-X) in a three-generation family manifesting the 
      disorder as a mutation in the methyl-CpG binding-protein 2 (MECP2) gene in Xq28. The 
      A140V mutation was found in all affected males and all carrier females in the 
      family. To date, descriptions have been published of two patients with independent 
      familial mental retardation (MR) and two patients with sporadic MR who harbor this 
      specific mutation in the MECP2 gene. This strongly suggests that A140V is a hot spot 
      of mutation resulting in moderate to severe MR in males. A simple and reliable PCR 
      approach has been developed for detection of the hot spot A140V mutation to 
      prescreen any other unexplained cases of MR before further extensive mutation 
      analyses.

      a deletion associated with choroideremia and nonspecific mental retardation.
PG  - 207-18
AB  - Microscopically detectable deletions and X;autosome translocations have previously 
      facilitated the construction of a high-resolution interval map of the Xq21 region. 
      Here, we have generated three yeast artificial chromosome contigs spanning 
      approximately 7 megabases of the Xq13.3-q21.31 region. In addition, a novel deletion 
      associated with choroideremia and mental retardation was identified and mapped in 
      detail. The proximal deletion endpoint was positioned between the loci DXS995 and 
      DXS232, which enabled us to confirm the critical region for a locus involved in 
      mental retardation. The distal deletion endpoint is situated in the Xq21.33 band, 
      which allowed us to refine the order of several markers in this region.

TI  - Refined 2.7 centimorgan locus in Xp21.3-22.1 for a nonspecific X-linked mental 
      retardation gene (MRX54).
PG  - 276-82
AB  - Nonspecific X-linked mental retardation (MRX) is a heterogeneous condition in which 
      mental retardation (MR) appears to be the only consistent manifestation. A large 
      genetic interval of assignment obtained on individual families by linkage analysis, 
      genetic, heterogeneity, and phenotypic variability usually are major obstacles to 
      fine-map and identify the related disease genes. Here we report on a large Tunisian 
      family (MRX54) with an MRX condition. X-linked recessive inheritance is strongly 
      suggested by the segregation of MR through seven unaffected carrier females to 14 
      affected males in two generations. Two-point linkage analysis demonstrated 
      significant linkage between the disorder and several markers in Xp21.3-22.1 (maximum 
      LOD score Zmax = 3.56, recombination fraction 0 = 0 at DXS1202), which was confirmed 
      by multipoint linkage analyses. Recombinant events observed with the flanking 
      markers DXS989 and DXS1218 delineate a refined locus of approximately 2.7 cM in 
      accordance with the physical distance between these two markers. The small interval 
      of assignment observed in this family overlaps not only with nine large MRX loci 
      previously reported in Xp21.3-22.1 but also with two inherited microdeletions in 
      Xp21.3-22.1 involved in nonspecific MR. Although the involvement of several genes 
      located in the Xp21.3-22.1 region cannot be ruled out, data reported in this study 
      could be used as a starting point for the search of such gene(s).

      predominance, central hypotonic facies, severe cognitive dysfunction, hemoglobin H 
      disease (α-thalassemia), genital and skeletal abnormalities, and autistic and 
      peculiar behavior. More than 200 patients in the world, including >70 Japanese 
      patients, have been diagnosed with ATR-X syndrome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We 
      reviewed the brain MRI and/or CT findings of 27 Japanese patients with ATR-X with 
      ATRX mutations retrospectively. RESULTS: The findings were categorized into 5 types: 
      1) nonspecific brain atrophy (17/27); 2) white matter abnormalities, especially 
      around the trigones (11/27); 3) widespread and scattered white matter abnormalities 
      (1/27); 4) delayed myelination (4/27); and 5) severe and rapidly progressive 
      cortical brain atrophy (1/27). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report on a 
      comprehensive study of brain MRI/CT findings of ATR-X syndrome. Our findings suggest 
      that the ATRX protein seems to be involved in normal myelination. The classification 
      will require revisions in the near future, but it will be helpful in establishing 
      the relationship between ATRX mutation and brain development and understanding the 
      ATRX protein function in the brain.

TI  - Fragile X syndrome and fragile XE mental retardation.
PG  - 1199-211
AB  - There are two forms of mental handicap associated with fragile sites on the end of 
      the long arm of the X chromosome. The well known common disorder Fragile X syndrome 
      is associated with FRAXA and a rare non-specific form of mental handicap is 
      associated with FRAXE. The cytogenetics of these fragile sites is considered. For 
      Fragile X syndrome details are given of the molecular genetics, inheritance 
      patterns, genetic counselling, methods for diagnosis of index cases, carrier 
      detection and prenatal diagnosis. Series of prenatal diagnoses are briefly reviewed 
      and technical and biological problems associated with this procedure are considered. 
      Prenatal diagnosis of Fragile X syndrome using molecular genetic techniques is now a 
      well established procedure, with the only significant problem being the inability to 
      accurately predict phenotype in female fetuses with full mutations. Few prenatal 
      diagnoses of Fragile XE non-specific mental retardation have been recorded. In 
      principle the technical aspects of such a prenatal diagnosis should be little 
      different from those for Fragile X syndrome. Incomplete knowledge of the phenotypic 
      effect of the full mutation in males and females would make phenotypic prediction 
      for any fetus shown to have such a mutation very difficult. At this stage all that 
      could be determined with precision is that the mutation was present or absent in the 
      fetus. Possible consequences of this are discussed.

TI  - Linkage analysis in Spanish families with nonspecific X-linked mental retardation: 
      Significant linkage at Xq13-q21.
PG  - 343-7
AB  - Mental retardation (MR) is a genetically heterogeneous, clinically variable 
      condition. Many cases of MR are linked to the X chromosome. The aim of this study 
      was to identify candidate loci for nonspecific MR in Spanish samples. We selected 
      seven families with nonspecific MR and a pattern of inheritance compatible with an 
      X-linked disorder and a group of 26 sib pairs of mentally retarded individuals. We 
      performed linkage analysis with a panel of 15 markers evenly distributed along the X 
      chromosome. The study showed linkage to marker DXS8076, located in Xq21.1, by the 
      lod score method (z = 2.11 at straight theta = 0.155) and the nonparametric extended 
      relative pair analysis method (chi(2) = 5.32; P < 0.03). Genetic heterogeneity was 
      found, with an estimated 75% of the families linked at recombination fraction 
      straight theta = 0.10 to the DXS8076 locus (chi(2) = 9.51; P < 0.009). Xq13-q21 is 
      one of the critical regions for X-linked MR previously reported, and our study 
      supports the idea that this region may contain a locus for MR in Spanish patients.

TI  - X-linked mental retardation: vanishing boundaries between non-specific (MRX) and 
      syndromic (MRXS) forms.
PG  - 423-32
AB  - This review covers the history and nosology of X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) in 
      which the following, largely clinically based, subclassification was used: fragile X 
      syndrome (FRAXA), syndromic forms (MRXS) and non-specific forms (MRX). After the 
      discovery of the FMR2 gene at the FRAXE site, 10 MRX genes have been identified in 
      the last 6 years. A short description is given of the strategies used to identify 
      the genes that cause mental retardation (MR). Furthermore, their potential functions 
      and the association with MR will be discussed. It is emphasized that mutations in 
      several of these MR genes can result in non-specific, as well as in syndromic forms 
      of XLMR. Present findings stress the importance of accurate clinical evaluation. 
      Most considerably, genotype-phenotype correlation studies of affected individuals in 
      XLMR families with MRX gene mutations are necessary to define the criteria of MRX vs 
      MRXS subclassification.

TI  - MRI in children with mental retardation.
PG  - 334-45
AB  - BACKGROUND: In mental retardation (MR) an aetiological diagnosis is not always 
      obtained despite a detailed history, physical examination and metabolic or genetic 
      investigations. In some of these patients, MRI is recommended and may identify 
      subtle abnormal brain findings. OBJECTIVE: We reviewed the cerebral MRI of children 
      with non-specific mental retardation in an attempt to establish a neuroanatomical 
      picture of this disorder. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty children with non-specific 
      MR were selected to undergo cerebral MRI. The examination included supratentorial 
      axial slices, mid-sagittal images and posterior fossa coronal images. Brain 
      malformations, midline and cerebellar abnormalities were studied. RESULTS: In 27 of 
      30 patients, the neuroimaging evaluation revealed a relatively high incidence of 
      cerebral and posterior fossa abnormalities. The most frequent were: dysplasia of the 
      corpus callosum (46%; hypoplasia, short corpus callosum and vertical splenium), 
      partially opened septum pellucidum and/or cavum vergae (33%), ventriculomegaly 
      (33%), cerebral cortical dysplasia (23%), subarachnoid space enlargement (16.6%), 
      vermian hypoplasia (33%), cerebellar and/or vermian disorganised folia (20%), and 
      subarachnoid spaces enlargement in the posterior fossa (20%). Other anomalies were: 
      enlarged Virchow-Robin spaces (10%), white matter anomalies (10%) and cerebellar or 
      vermian atrophy. CONCLUSIONS: MRI has shown a high incidence of subtle cerebral 
      abnormalities and unexpected minor forms of cerebellar cortical dysplasia. Even if 
      most of these abnormalities are considered as subtle markers of brain dysgenesis, 
      their role in the pathogenesis of mental retardation needs further investigation.

TI  - Implication of screening for FMR1 and FMR2 gene mutation in individuals with 
      nonspecific mental retardation in Taiwan.
PG  - 75-80
AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of familial mental retardation 
      (MR), attributable to (CGG)n expansion in the FMR1 gene. FRAXE is less frequent, 
      associated with a similar mutation of the FMR2 gene. This study attempted to 
      ascertain the prevalence of both disorders in Taiwan, as well as to develop a method 
      to effectively find carriers. A total of 321 patients with nonspecific MR were 
      screened for the FMR1 and FMR2 mutation. Four of 206 boys and men (1.9%) and 1 in 
      115 girls and women (0.9%) were identified as having FXS. All four FXS boys or men 
      could be identified by Southern blot analysis, as well as by a simple nonradioactive 
      polymerase chain reaction analysis. None of the 206 boys or men had FMR2 full 
      mutation. This confirmed the low incidence of FRAXE in Chinese. FXS appears to be 
      more prevalent among patients with mild MR, because 4 of the 5 patients with FXS 
      were from the 115 with mild MR (3.48%) and only 1 was from the other 206 with severe 
      MR (0.49%). All five FXS cases were maternally inherited. Other family members were 
      resistant to further searching for carriers. It is worth noting that none of these 
      mothers had a discernible premarital family history of MR. Thus the negative family 
      history could not preclude the possibility that a woman was a carrier. To identify 
      female carriers of childbearing age, beyond the scope of family history, is thus 
      worthy of further exploration. Screening men for carriers using this inexpensive 
      method is probably feasible, even though normal transmitting men have no immediate 
      risk of producing a child with the disease. Female carriers can then be effectively 
      identified from these normal transmitting men and can take all preventive measures.

TI  - Molecular genetics of X-linked mental retardation: a complex picture emerging.
PG  - 220-5
AB  - Mental retardation or intellectual disability is a heterogeneous group of disorders 
      of the human brain affecting 2-3% of the general population. It is becoming evident 
      that a large proportion of mental retardation is genetically determined, which means 
      that it can be molecularly defined and thus precisely diagnosed. Building knowledge 
      and understanding about molecular processes leading to 'malfunction of human brain' 
      will clearly bring benefits to patient management, disease prevention and ultimately 
      disease treatment and will also assist in tackling much harder questions of the 
      molecular basis of human cognitive ability. In this review the current knowledge of 
      the molecular genetics of X-chromosome-linked mental retardation and its nonspecific 
      forms in particular is discussed, together with limitations affecting diagnosis and 
      likely new approaches that need to be implemented.

TI  - Non-specific X-linked mental retardation: background, types, diagnosis and 
      prevalence.
PG  - 205-13
AB  - This paper reviews non-specific X-linked mental retardation (X-linked MR), a 
      heterogeneous group of X-linked recessive disorders which are controlled by one or 
      more genes located on the X chromosome. Presently, there are at least three major 
      subdivisions of X-linked MR. The IQ of affected males is variable. Carrier females 
      usually have normal intelligence but some do show partial expression resulting in 
      retardation. Genetics units can diagnose affected males utilizing pedigree analysis, 
      clinical evaluation and cytogenetic testing (fragile X-linked MR type only). 
      Projections indicate X-linked MR may be as common in males as Down syndrome and 
      could account for 25% of the retarded male population.

PG  - 380-4
AB  - The phenotypic nonspecificity of many forms of X-linked mental retardation has 
      hampered attempts to classify them into clinically homogeneous groups. One such 
      condition, described by Clark and Baraitser [1987: Am J Med Genet 26:13-15], has 
      been the subject of a single pedigree report to date. We now describe a further 
      pedigree whose affected members share many manifestations with those reported by 
      Clark and Baraitser, and we consider the possible distinction between this condition 
      and Atkin-Flaitz syndrome.

TI  - Unexplained mental retardation: is brain MRI useful?
PG  - 587-96
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mental retardation (MR), defined as an IQ below 70, is a frequent cause 
      of consultation in paediatrics. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the yield of brain MRI in the 
      diagnostic work-up of unexplained MR in children. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The MRI 
      features and clinical data of 100 patients (age 1-18 years) affected with 
      non-progressive MR of unknown origin were compared to an age-matched control group 
      (n=100). Two radiologists conducted an independent review of the MRI scans. RESULTS: 
      Univariate and multivariate analyses showed a higher incidence of brain anomalies in 
      the MR group than in the control group (53 vs 17, OR=5.7 [2.9-11.1]), for signal 
      abnormalities within the periventricular white matter (OR=20.3 [2.6-155.3]), lateral 
      ventricular dilatation (OR=15.6 [2.0-124]), mild corpus callosum abnormalities 
      (shortness, atrophy) (OR=6.8 [1.8-25.6]) and subtle cerebellar abnormalities, 
      including fissure enlargement (OR=5.2 [1.1-26.2]). The diagnostic value of MRI 
      abnormalities was considered good in 5% of patients (Alexander disease n=1, diffuse 
      cortical malformation n=1, leukomalacia n=1, vermian agenesis n=1, commissural 
      agenesis n=1), and weak in 48% of patients, in whom non-specific abnormalities did 
      not lead to a diagnosis. Some clinical features resulted in a significantly higher 
      percentage of abnormal MRI scans: abnormal neurological examination (82% vs 47%, 
      P=0.008), abnormal skull circumference (66% vs 49%, P=0.04). Motor delay was 
      associated with cerebellar abnormalities (P=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms 
      the weak diagnostic yield of MRI in mentally retarded children. The use of a control 
      group has enabled us to identify the neuroimaging markers frequently associated with 
      MR. Subgrouping patients according to neuroimaging markers and clinical signs should 
      help identify those who would benefit from molecular studies.

TI  - A comparison of language characteristics of mentally retarded adults with fragile X 
      syndrome and those with nonspecific mental retardation and autism.
PG  - 457-68
AB  - Fragile X syndrome is a recently identified form of mental retardation that is 
      associated with a chromosomal abnormality and inherited in an X-linked manner. 
      Previous studies have suggested that distinctive speech and language characteristics 
      are associated with the syndrome. Twelve adult male residents of an institution for 
      the retarded (aged 23 to 51 years) were compared on a series of speech and language 
      measures to 12 adult males with nonspecific forms of MR who were residents of the 
      same institution and were matched on age and IQ. A second contrast group consisted 
      of similarly matched autistic men. Results revealed that there were no significant 
      differences among the groups' performance, with the exception of increased rates of 
      echolalia in the autistic group. A nonsignificant trend toward poorer performance on 
      expressive measures on the part of the fragile X group was noted. The implications 
      of these findings for further research on the syndrome are discussed.

TI  - Non-specific X-linked semidominant mental retardation by mutations in a Rab 
      GDP-dissociation inhibitor.
PG  - 1311-5
AB  - Non-specific X-linked mental retardation (MRX) is a very common disorder which 
      affects approximately 1 in 600 males. Despite this high frequency, little is known 
      about the molecular defects underlying this disorder, mainly because of the clinical 
      and genetic heterogeneity which is evident from linkage studies. Recently, a 
      collaborative study using the candidate gene approach demonstrated the presence of 
      mutations in GDIalpha, a Rab GDP-dissociation inhibitor encoded by a gene localized 
      in Xq28, associated with non-specific mental retardation. GDIalpha is mainly a 
      brain-specific protein that plays a critical role in the recycling of Rab GTPases 
      involved in membrane vesicular transport. The study presented here was designed to 
      assess the prevalence of mutations in the GDIalpha in mentally retarded patients and 
      to discuss the clinical phenotypes observed in affected individuals. Mutation 
      screening of the whole coding region of the GDIalpha gene, using a combination of 
      denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and direct sequencing, was carried out in 
      164 patients found negative for expansions across the FRAXA GCC repeat. In addition 
      to the nonsense mutation recently reported in MRX48, we have identified a novel 
      missense mutation in exon 11 of the GDIalpha gene in one familial form of 
      non-specific mental retardation. In this family (family R), all affected males show 
      moderate to severe mental retardation, and the X-linked semidominant inheritance is 
      strongly suggested by the severe phenotypes in males with respect to mildly affected 
      females or unaffected obligatory carriers. This study showed that the prevalence of 
      GDIalpha mutations in non-specific mental retardation could be estimated to be 
      0.5-1%, and molecular diagnosis and genetic counselling in some cases of 
      non-specific mental handicap can now be provided.

PG  - 81-96
AB  - Eighty-one probands from an initial population of 223 school-aged retarded 
      individuals were assessed by history, clinical examination and, where appropriate, 
      cytogenetic analysis. In 51 individuals, the retardation occurred as an isolated 
      event within the family, whereas 30 patients had a family history of retardation. In 
      39 of the isolated individuals, the retardation was either related to environmental 
      factors or associated with a major neurological abnormality. The remaining 12 
      patients were phenotypically normal with no cytogenetic abnormality. Of the 30 
      probands from 15 families with a history of retardation, 3 families had X-linked 
      syndromes. One, with 4 proband daughters, had the mar(X) syndrome and two families 
      were considered to have the phenotypically similar syndrome but without 
      demonstrating the mar(X). In an additional 5 families, the distribution and clinical 
      features of the affected individuals were compatible with nonspecific X-linked 
      mental retardation.

TI  - MECP2 mutation analysis in patients with mental retardation.
PG  - 121-4
AB  - Mutations in the methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2) gene are known to underlie 
      Rett' syndrome, the most common cause of mental retardation (MR) in girls. Since the 
      original report, phenotypes resulting from MECP2 mutations have been shown to 
      extend, for example, to several Rett variants, autism, atypical Angelman syndrome, 
      and nonspecific MR. It was earlier proposed that MECP2 mutations might account for 
      approximately 2% of the male cases with nonspecific MR. Thereby, the frequency of 
      MECP2 mutations in the mentally retarded population would be comparable to that of 
      Fragile-X syndrome. The aim of this study was to analyze well-characterized cases 
      with MR and to clarify the role of the MECP2 gene in the etiology of MR and atypical 
      Angelman syndrome. The coding sequence of the MECP2 gene was analyzed in a sample of 
      118 patients (103 males, 15 females) by direct sequencing. Two coding sequence 
      variants, 602C > T (A201V) and 1189G > A (E397K), were identified. In addition, we 
      identified four variants in the intronic or 3'UTR regions. None of these variants is 
      likely to be causal. We conclude that the evidence across all the mutation screening 
      studies implies that MECP2 mutations do not represent a major cause of nonspecific 
      MR.

TI  - X-linked hydrocephalus.
PG  - 921-8
AB  - We report on a family with X-linked hydrocephalus: progressive increase in head 
      circumference (OFC) led to the diagnosis in 3 patients; however, in 5 with normal 
      OFC, the initial diagnosis had been "nonspecific" mental retardation, until 
      identification of relatedness between 3 macrocephalic boys suggested segregation of 
      a major Mendelian gene. Moderate to severe hydrocephaly was present in all 
      macrocephalic patients and in 3 of the 5 with normal OFC, but CT-scan of the brain 
      did not show aqueductal stenosis in any of them. We stress the importance of a brain 
      CT-scan in every male with "nonspecific" mental retardation, especially in cases 
      with X-linked inheritance, because confirmation of X-linkage has important genetic 
      counseling consequences.

TI  - [Congenital hypothyroidism].
PG  - 451-65
AB  - Congenital hypothyroidism is one of the most common diseases in paediatric 
      endocrinology. Thyroid hormones are essential in brain development, which takes 
      place during foetal life and early postnatal life up to the 2nd year of age. The 
      main etiologic factors of congenital hypothyroidism are anomalies of development, 
      function and regulation of the thyroid gland. Clinical signs of thyroid hormone 
      deficiency in infants are non-specific. Early diagnosis is based on newborn 
      screening for congenital hypothyroidism, which was started in Poland in 1977. 
      Treatment within the first days of life with appropriate dosage of thyroxine 
      prevents mental retardation. This paper summarises current knowledge on congenital 
      hypothyroidism in children.

TI  - Regional localization of a nonspecific X-linked mental retardation gene (MRX59) to 
      Xp21.2-p22.2.
PG  - 266-70
AB  - Linkage analysis was performed on a four-generation family with nonspecific mental 
      retardation (MRX59). The five affected males, ranging in age from 2 years to 52 
      years, have a normal facial appearance and mild to severe mental impairment. Four 
      obligate carriers are physically normal and not retarded. A maximum LOD score of 
      2.41 at straight theta = 0.00 was observed with the microsatellite markers, DMD45 in 
      Xp21.2, DXS989 in Xp22.1, and DXS207 in Xp22.2. Recombinations were detected within 
      the dystrophin gene (DMD) in one of the affected males and between DXS207 and DXS987 
      in Xp22.2 in one of the carriers. These recombinants define the proximal and distal 
      boundaries of a candidate gene region. Genetic localization of this familial 
      condition made prenatal diagnosis informative for one of the obligate carriers.

TI  - Study of X-linked mental retardation (XLMR): summary of 61 families in the 
      Miami/Greenwood Study.
PG  - 169-75
AB  - The initial goal of this study was to localize as many genes as possible that lead 
      to syndromic and nonspecific XLMR. More recently, this goal has been redefined to 
      include narrowing these localizations and cloning specific genes. In the last 5 
      years, 61 families have participated in this study; 34 have a projected or actual 
      lod score greater than 2.0. Restudy of 12 families reported previously has been a 
      particularly productive aspect of this study and has led to clinical redefinition 
      and new or improved localization of most of these syndromes. Five possible new XLMR 
      syndromes have been identified. Five large families with nonspecific XLMR have been 
      regionally localized. Since many XLMR conditions are based on only 1 or 2 family 
      reports, one of the major purposes of this summary is to provide clinical data on 
      the study families so that collaborative projects can be undertaken with other 
      centers that have similar families.

TI  - X-linked mental retardation and autism are associated with a mutation in the NLGN4 
      gene, a member of the neuroligin family.
PG  - 552-7
AB  - A large French family including members affected by nonspecific X-linked mental 
      retardation, with or without autism or pervasive developmental disorder in affected 
      male patients, has been found to have a 2-base-pair deletion in the Neuroligin 4 
      gene (NLGN4) located at Xp22.33. This mutation leads to a premature stop codon in 
      the middle of the sequence of the normal protein and is thought to suppress the 
      transmembrane domain and sequences important for the dimerization of neuroligins 
      that are required for proper cell-cell interaction through binding to 
      beta-neurexins. As the neuroligins are mostly enriched at excitatory synapses, these 
      results suggest that a defect in synaptogenesis may lead to deficits in cognitive 
      development and communication processes. The fact that the deletion was present in 
      both autistic and nonautistic mentally retarded males suggests that the NLGN4 gene 
      is not only involved in autism, as previously described, but also in mental 
      retardation, indicating that some types of autistic disorder and mental retardation 
      may have common genetic origins.

TI  - Mutations in GDI1 and X-linked non-specific mental retardation.
PG  - 71-9
AB  - Mental retardation (MR) is a complex phenotype characterized by suboptimal 
      functioning of the central nervous system (CNS). It is estimated that from 1 to 3% 
      of the general population is affected with MR. MR or "intellectual disability" can 
      be caused by genetic as well as environmental causes that act on the development and 
      functioning of the CNS prenatally, perinatally or postnatally. Genetic causes of MR 
      include chromosome aneusomies, chromosome structural abnormalities, genomic 
      disorders and monogenic diseases. Amongst children, acute MR (QI < 50) is estimated 
      at 0.4% and faint MR is about 2.5-3%. To determine the etiology of the MR, many 
      diagnostic studies have been conducted and they show that MR is very heterogeneous 
      and its etiology is not yet known in 20-50% of the group of patients with severe MR. 
      This percentage increases up to 75-80% in the group of individuals with mild or 
      "borderline" forms of MR. In light of the literature results, we tried to carry out 
      a screening of 41 subjects with nonspecific MR for the detection of mutations in the 
      gene GDI1 using the DHPLC methodology. This technique has the following advantages: 
      low cost, high sensitivity (> 95%), and it can be done quickly. We have found 3 
      nucleotide (nt) substitutions: an intronic polymorphism at nt 107877 A --> C, a 
      polymorphism in exon 3 at nt 109259 T --> C (Asn73Asn), and an intronic polymorphism 
      at nt 110314 G --> C. The mutations in this gene are common and do not seem to 
      influence the gene expression so as to cause a change in phenotype. These results 
      therefore do not encourage the research of a diagnostic protocol designed for 
      mutational analysis of the GDI1 human gene as the only responsible factor for a 
      complex disease as Mental Retardation X-linked (MRX).

TI  - Novel mutation of IL1RAPL1 gene in a nonspecific X-linked mental retardation (MRX) 
      family.
PG  - 3167-72
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.a.32613 [doi]
AB  - Mental retardation (MR) affects approximately 2% of the population. About 10% of all 
      MR cases result from defects of X-linked genes. Mutations in most of more than 20 
      known genes causing nonspecific form of X-linked MR (MRX) are very rare and may 
      account for less than 0.5-1% of MR. Linkage studies in extended pedigrees followed 
      by mutational analysis of known MRX genes in the linked interval are often the only 
      way to identify a genetic cause of the disorder. We performed linkage analysis in 
      several MRX families, and in one family with four males with MR we mapped the 
      disease to an interval encompassing Xp21.2-22.11 (with a maximum LOD score of 2.71). 
      Subsequent mutation analysis of genes located in this interval allowed us to 
      identify a partial deletion of the IL1RAPL1 gene. Different nonoverlapping deletions 
      involving IL1RAPL1 have been reported previously, suggesting that this region could 
      be deletion-prone. In this report, we present the results of the molecular analyses 
      and clinical examinations of four affected family members with the deletion in 
      IL1RAPL1. Our data further confirm the importance and usefulness of linkage studies 
      for gene mapping in MRX families and demonstrate that IL1RAPL1 plays an important 
      role in the etiology of MRX. With the development of new methods (aCGH, MLPA), 
      further rearrangements in this gene (including deletions and duplications) might be 
      discovered in the nearest future.

PG  - 474-9
AB  - Two families with nonspecific X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) are presented. In 
      the first family, MRX49, 5 male patients in 2 generations showed mild to moderate 
      mental retardation. Two-point linkage analysis with 28 polymorphic markers, 
      dispersed over the X-chromosome, yielded a maximal LOD score of 2.107 with markers 
      DXS7107 and DXS8051 at theta = 0.0, localizing the MRX49 gene at Xp22.3-p22.2, 
      between Xpter and marker DXS8022. Multipoint linkage analysis showed negative LOD 
      values over all other regions of the chromosome. In the second family, MRX50, 4 
      males in 2 generations showed moderate mental retardation. Pairwise linkage analysis 
      with 28 polymorphic markers yielded a LOD score of 2.056 with markers DXS8054, 
      DXS1055, and DXS1204, all at theta = 0.0. Flanking markers were DXS8012 and DXS991, 
      situating the MRX50 gene at Xp11.3-Xp11.21, in the pericentromeric part of the short 
      arm of the X chromosome.

AB  - Up to now, we have identified 77 X-linked conditions in which mental retardation is 
      the primary or a major component manifestation. These conditions were subdivided 
      into 2 categories, designated respectively "X-linked mental retardation syndromes" 
      and "Non-specific X-linked mental retardation". Forty genes have been regionally 
      mapped onto the X chromosome. However, in several instances the data were derived 
      from a single family and most lod scores were less than 3.0.

AB  - A current list of all known forms of X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) and a 
      slightly revised classification are presented. The number of known disorders has not 
      increased because 6 disorders have been combined based on new molecular data or on 
      clinical grounds and only 6 newly described XLMR disorders have been reported. Of 
      the current 105 XLMR disorders, 34 have been mapped, and 18 disorders and 1 
      nonspecific XLMR (FRAXE) have been cloned. The number of families with nonspecific 
      XLMR with a LOD score of > or = 2.0 has more than doubled, with 42 (including FRAXE) 
      now being known. a summary of the localization of presumed nonspecific mental 
      retardation (MR) genes from well-studied X-chromosomal translocations and deletions 
      is also included. Only 10-12 nonoverlapping loci are required to explain all 
      localizations of nonspecific MR from both approaches. These new trends mark the 
      beginning of a significantly improved understanding of the role of genes on the X 
      chromosome in producing MR. Continued close collaboration between clinical and 
      molecular investigators will be required to complete the process.

TI  - A truncating mutation in the IL1RAPL1 gene is responsible for X-linked mental 
      retardation in the MRX21 family.
PG  - 482-7
AB  - X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) is a genetically heterogeneous condition, due to 
      mutations in at least 50 genes, involved in functioning of the central nervous 
      system and located on the X chromosome. Nonspecific XLMR (MRX) is characterized 
      essentially by mental retardation transmitted by X-linked inheritance. More than 80 
      extended MRX pedigrees have been reported to date, which have been distinguished 
      exclusively by physical position of the corresponding gene on the X chromosome, 
      established by linkage analysis. One such family, MRX21, which was described by us 
      in 1993 and localized to Xp11.4-pter, has now been reanalyzed with additional 
      markers and after one more affected individual had became available. This extra 
      information allowed a significant reduction of the linkage interval and, eventually, 
      identification of the mutant gene. A stop mutation in exon 10 of the IL1RAPL1 gene 
      (in Xp21) was found in the four affected males and in obligate carriers, allowing 
      conclusive counseling of other family members of uncertain carrier status. The W487X 
      mutation results in the production of a truncated IL1RAPL protein, comprised of the 
      extracellular Ig-like domain and transmembrane tract, but lacking the last 210 
      aminoacids of the cytoplasmic domain. MRX21 is the first extended MRX family with a 
      point mutation in IL1RAPL1 and the second with a stop mutation, which had been 
      previously found only in a small family. Our report confirms the role of the 
      IL1RAPL1 gene in causing nonspecific mental retardation in males and underlines the 
      importance of detailed linkage analysis before candidate gene mutational screening.

TI  - Brain plasticity in paediatric neurology.
PG  - 105-13
AB  - Plasticity includes the brain's capacity to be shaped or moulded by experience, the 
      capacity to learn and remember, and the ability to reorganize and recover after 
      injury. Mechanisms for plasticity include activity-dependent refinement of neuronal 
      connections and synaptic plasticity as a substrate for learning and memory. The 
      molecular mechanisms for these processes utilize signalling cascades that relay 
      messages from synaptic receptors to the nucleus and the cytoskeleton to control the 
      structure of axons and dendrites. Several paediatric neurological disorders such as 
      neurofibromatosis-1, Fragile X syndrome, Rett syndrome, and other syndromic and 
      non-specific forms of mental retardation involve lesions in these signalling 
      pathways. Acquired disorders such as hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy, lead 
      poisoning and epilepsy also involve signalling pathways including excitatory 
      glutamate receptors. Information about these 'plasticity pathways' is useful for 
      understanding their pathophysiology and potential therapy.

TI  - Gene for nonspecific X-linked mental retardation (MRX 47) is located in Xq22.3-q24.
PG  - 324-8
AB  - We describe a large family with nonspecific X-linked mental retardation (MRX 47). An 
      X-linked recessive transmission is suggested by the inheritance from the mothers in 
      two generations of a moderate to severe form of mental retardation in six males, 
      without any specific clinical findings. Two point linkage analysis demonstrated 
      significant linkage between the disorder and two markers in Xq23 (Zmax = 3.75, theta 
      = 0). Multipoint linkage analyses confirmed the significant linkage with a maximum 
      lod score (Z = 3.96, theta = 0) at DXS1059. Recombination events observed with the 
      flanking markers DXS1105 and DXS8067 delineate a 17 cM interval. This interval 
      overlaps with several loci of XLMR disorders previously localized in Xq23-q24, which 
      are reviewed herein.

TI  - [Inherited GPI deficiencies:a new disease with intellectual disability and 
      epilepsy].
PG  - 5-13
AB  - Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) is a glycolipid, which anchors 150 or more types 
      of proteins to the cell surface. There are at least 26 genes involved in the 
      biosynthesis and transport of GPI-anchored proteins (GPI-APs). Many inherited GPI 
      deficiencies (IGDs) have been recently found using whole-exome sequencing. Patients 
      with IGD have only a partial deficiency because complete GPI deficiency causes 
      embryonic death. The major symptoms of IGDs include intellectual disability, 
      epilepsy, coarse facial features, and multiple organ anomalies. These symptoms vary 
      in severity depending upon the degree of the defect and/or position in the pathway 
      of the affected gene. We clarified a mechanism of hyperphosphatasia, which is 
      characterized by elevated release of tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase. 
      Hyperphosphatasia is observed in some patients with IGDs, such as hyperphosphatasia 
      mental retardation syndrome or Mabry syndrome, caused by mutations in genes in the 
      later stage of GPI biosynthesis. The possibility of IGD should be considered in 
      patients with seizures and intellectual disability. The presence of 
      hyperphosphatasia is strong evidence of IGD. Flow cytometric analysis of GPI-APs on 
      granulocytes is also useful for the detection of IGD.

      Xp22.2-p22.3.
PG  - 387-90
AB  - Nonspecific X-linked mental retardation (MRX) includes several distinct genetic 
      entities in which mental retardation is not associated with additional 
      distinguishing physical changes. We report linkage data in a Spanish family with 
      MRX, using polymorphic DNA markers distributed over the X chromosome. Two-point 
      linkage analysis demonstrated close linkage between the MRX locus and DXS85 in 
      Xp22.3 with a peak lod score of 2.28 at a theta = 0.00. Analysis of multiple 
      informative meioses suggested a localization of the MRX locus (MRX24) between DXS278 
      and DXS207. Multipoint linkage analysis resulted in a maximum LOD score of 2.45 at 3 
      cM proximal to DXS85, and allowed us to reject a localization of the MRX24 gene in 
      all other regions from Xp21-Xqter. These findings localize the MRX24 gene in the 
      chromosomal region Xp22.2-p22.3.

TI  - X-linked nonspecific mental retardation (MRX16) mapping to distal Xq28: linkage 
      study and neuropsychological data in a large family.
PG  - 411-8
AB  - A genetic linkage study was performed on a large four-generation family with 
      variable nonspecific X-linked mental retardation (MRX16), speech abnormalities, and 
      retardation of all milestones. Significant linkage was found in the Xq28 region with 
      loci DXS52, DXS15, BGN, and DXS1108 with maximum LOD scores of 4.86, 4.01, 4.83, and 
      5.43, respectively, at theta = 0.00. Recombination was observed at the locus 
      DXS1113, thus mapping the gene in an 8-Mb interval between this marker and the Xq 
      telomere. Linkage intervals of three other MRX families overlap with this interval 
      in Xq28 where the RABGDIA gene, mutated in the MRX41 and MRX48 families, is also 
      located. In MRX3, MRX28, but also in MRX16, no alteration of RABGDIA has been found, 
      thus suggesting the existence of at least two MRX genes in distal Xq28.

TI  - Mental retardation's two cultures of behavioral research.
PG  - 675-87
AB  - People with mental retardation are generally classified by either level of 
      retardation (usually by psychologists and special educators) or etiology (usually by 
      geneticists and psychiatric researchers). We have surveyed nine journals from 
      1985-1990 to identify use of these two distinct research approaches, or cultures. 
      After providing brief vignettes to delineate the separateness of the two cultures, 
      we documented the varied effects that genetic etiology may have on behavior. The 
      problems and issues inherent in reconciling these two research cultures were also 
      emphasized, including variability within etiological groups, etiologic specificity 
      versus nonspecificity, and service delivery implications. Several points of 
      reconciliation between the two research cultures were offered, with the goal being 
      better integrated approaches to the study of behavior in mental retardation.

TI  - To match or not to match? Methodological issues in autism-related research.
PG  - 81-6
AB  - Studies of autism typically adopt a factorial matched-groups design aimed at 
      eliminating nonspecific factors such as mental retardation as explanations of 
      performance on experimental tasks. This paper reviews the issues involved in 
      designing such studies and interpreting their results and suggests that the best 
      approach to matching may be to equate performance on carefully designed control 
      tasks. However, we also argue that the interpretation of such studies is often 
      complicated by the fact that associations between background measures and 
      experimental task performance are not clear. Consequently, we also advocate the use 
      of regression techniques that allow the researcher to determine the factors that 
      relate to task performance and to assess the extent of group differences on the task 
      of interest having taken these factors into account.

TI  - Molecular screening of FRAXA and FRAXE in Indian patients with unexplained mental 
      retardation.
PG  - 335-9
AB  - Fragile-X mental retardation is the commonest form of inherited mental retardation. 
      We have studied 146 Indian patients (174 X chromosomes) with unexplained mental 
      retardation by molecular methods. All study subjects were unrelated. Three of the 
      118 males were found to have the FMR1 full mutation. None of the patients tested 
      were positive for the FMR2 full mutation. The Fragile X prevalence was 2.5% among 
      males, which is lower than previously reported in Indian mentally retarded patients. 
      Screening for Fragile X among patients with nonspecific mental retardation is 
      important, even if there is no family history of mental retardation or typical 
      behavioral or physical features associated with the Fragile-X phenotype. 
      Identification of positive cases is also very important for the families, because of 
      the high recurrence risk of the disease. Large multicenter screening programs with 
      uniform criteria would be worthwhile to determine the prevalence of Fragile-X mental 
      retardation in the Indian population.

TI  - Pathogenic factors in idiopathic mental retardation.
PG  - 484-93
AB  - Pathogenic factors in a mentally retarded population were evaluated by comparing 
      their frequency among three groups of patients: a control group with predominantly 
      genetic retardation and consanguineous parents; a group with severe idiopathic 
      retardation and unrelated parents; and a group with mild idiopathic retardation and 
      unrelated parents. Seven factors were found to be significantly more common among 
      the patients with idiopathic retardation than in the genetic control group: a 
      history of maternal reproductive inefficiency; bleeding during pregnancy; toxemia 
      during pregnancy; signs of perinatal stress; neonatal anoxia; neonatal jaundice; and 
      seizures during the first year of life. A history of repeated maternal abortions was 
      particularly associated with mild retardation, and infantile seizures were 
      particularly associated with severe retardation. The latter association remained 
      significant even after exclusion of all infantile spasms, neonatal seizures and 
      symptomatic seizures. Since the control group in this study was composed mainly of 
      genetically retarded patients, the associations observed seem likely to be related 
      to the causes of retardation rather than simply being the effects of a damaged 
      fetus.

OAB - Several complications and diseases of pregnancy, delivery, and infancy have been 
      found to be more prevalent among the mentally retarded than among normal children. 
      In the course of reviewing 904 families of retarded children examined at the Tel 
      Hashomer Assessment Center for the retarded (Israel), a group of 87 children with a 
      nonspecific phenotype were isolated. Genetic analysis showed this to be of 75% 
      autosomal recessive etiology. These mainly genetically retarded patients were used 
      as a control group to assess a number of pathogenic factors in mental retardation. 3 
      groups of retarded patients with complete and reliable medical histories were 
      compared: 87 retarded children with unidifferentiated phenotype, whose parents had 
      normal intelligence and were either uncle-niece pairs or 1st cousins, and 
      intelligence quotients (IQs) were less than 50 in 61 of these cases and between 50 
      and 69 in the remaining 26; 161 cases with idiopathic retardation with unrelated 
      parents of normal intelligence, without retarded siblings; and 75 idiopathic 
      retarded cases similar to the group of 161 cases but with only mild retardation. 
      Complications of pregnancy, labor, and infancy were seen in 21 of the 61 control 
      retarded groups with IQs under 50 and in 9 of the 26 with IQs 50 to 69. They were 
      observed in 100 of the 161 cases of severe idiopathic retardation and in 53 of the 
      75 cases of mild idiopathic retardation. 11 factors were common enough to permit 
      individual analysis: maternal age; history of multiple or recent spontaneous 
      abortions; bleeding during pregnancy; toxemia; prematurity; low birthweight at term; 
      signs of fetal or neonatal distress; neonatal anoxia; significant neonatal jaundice; 
      convulsions during the 1st year of life; and evidence of early maternal neglect or 
      chronic infantile illness. Maternal age over 35 at the time of birth was of no 
      etiological importance. Abortions, either multiple or in the immediately preceding 
      or subsequent pregnancy, were more than twice as common in the cases of mild 
      idiopathic retardation as in the control group. The group with severe idiopathic 
      retardation showed only a slight, insignificant increase in maternal abortions 
      relative to the control group. Bleeding during early or middle pregnancy was more 
      than 3 times as common in both the mild and severe idiopathic retarded groups as in 
      the control group of homozygotes. Toxemia of pregnancy was twice as common among 
      those with mild idiopathic retardation and 2-1/2 times as common in severe 
      idiopathic retardation compared with the homozygote control group. Prematurity and 
      low birthweight showed only a slight and nonsignificant rise in the 2 idiopathic 
      groups relative to the controls. Signs of perinatal stress were practically 
      nonexistent in the controls and were significantly more common in both the mild and 
      severe idiopathic groups. Neonatal anoxia requiring some degree of medical attention 
      was about 3 times as common in the 2 test groups. Events of neglect were as common 
      in the control as in the other groups. Seizure prevalence in the 1st year of life 
      showed a nonsignificant increase in the mild idiopathic group and an increase of 
      marked significance in the severe idiopathic group relative to the controls.

TI  - Mutations in the human ortholog of Aristaless cause X-linked mental retardation and 
      epilepsy.
PG  - 441-5
AB  - Mental retardation and epilepsy often occur together. They are both heterogeneous 
      conditions with acquired and genetic causes. Where causes are primarily genetic, 
      major advances have been made in unraveling their molecular basis. The human X 
      chromosome alone is estimated to harbor more than 100 genes that, when mutated, 
      cause mental retardation. At least eight autosomal genes involved in idiopathic 
      epilepsy have been identified, and many more have been implicated in conditions 
      where epilepsy is a feature. We have identified mutations in an X chromosome-linked, 
      Aristaless-related, homeobox gene (ARX), in nine families with mental retardation 
      (syndromic and nonspecific), various forms of epilepsy, including infantile spasms 
      and myoclonic seizures, and dystonia. Two recurrent mutations, present in seven 
      families, result in expansion of polyalanine tracts of the ARX protein. These 
      probably cause protein aggregation, similar to other polyalanine and polyglutamine 
      disorders. In addition, we have identified a missense mutation within the ARX 
      homeodomain and a truncation mutation. Thus, it would seem that mutation of ARX is a 
      major contributor to X-linked mental retardation and epilepsy.

TI  - Sib risks for nonspecific mental retardation in British Columbia.
PG  - 197-208
AB  - Cases of nonspecific mental retardation (MR) born in British Columbia between 1952 
      and 1970 ascertained through the British Columbia Health Surveillance Registry were 
      linked by birth registration number to family sibships from computer-linked 
      groupings of birth and marriage records in British Columbia. It was possible to 
      retrieve family information for 97% of the cases by this method. Because of good 
      ascertainment and relatively large sample size, the 1952-1965 birth cohort 
      comprising 2,209 index cases was selected for calculations of overall risks and 
      recurrence risks to sibs categorized by sex, MR level, associated neurological 
      disability, and singleton versus multiple birth. The overall risk of affected 
      individuals among all sibs was 4.4 +/- 0.6%, which was about ten times greater than 
      the minimum population incidence of nonspecific MR. The risk among subsequent sibs 
      of the first affected case in a family was 3.7 +/- 0.8%. These risks varied 
      depending on sex, MR level, and whether the mental retardation was associated with 
      hydrocephalus, microcephalus, cerebral palsy, or epilepsy. The recurrence risk after 
      two affected individuals was 12 +/- 7%--about three times greater than after one 
      affected individual. Even though the frequency of MR is greater among twins than in 
      the overall population, the recurrence risk of nonspecific MR was not significantly 
      different for index cases from either singleton or multiple births.

TI  - Ocular manifestations in the X-linked intellectual disability syndromes.
PG  - 401-412
LID - 10.1080/13816810.2016.1247459 [doi]
AB  - Intellectual disability (ID), a common neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by 
      limitations of both intellectual functioning and adaptive behavior, affects an 
      estimated 1-2% of children. Genetic causes of ID are often accompanied by 
      recognizable syndromal patterns. The vision apparatus is a sensory extension of the 
      brain, and individuals with intellectual disabilities frequently have coexisting 
      abnormalities of ocular structures and the visual pathway system. About one-third of 
      the X-linked intellectual disability (XLID) syndromes have significant eye or ocular 
      adnexa abnormalities that provide important diagnostic clues. Some XLID syndromes 
      (e.g. Aicardi, cerebrooculogenital, Graham anophthalmia, Lenz, Lowe, MIDAS) are 
      widely known for their characteristic ocular manifestations. Nystagmus, optic 
      atrophy, and strabismus are among the more common, nonspecific, ocular 
      manifestations that contribute to neuro-ophthalmological morbidity. Common 
      dysmorphic oculofacial findings include anophthalmia, microphthalmia, hypertelorism, 
      and abnormalities in the configuration or orientation of the palpebral fissures. 
      Four XLID syndromes with major ocular manifestations (incontinentia pigmenti, Goltz, 
      MIDAS, and Aicardi syndromes) are notable because of male lethality and expression 
      occurring predominantly in females. The majority of the genes associated with XLID 
      and ocular manifestations have now been identified.

TI  - X-linked mental retardation with neonatal hypotonia in a French family (MRX15): gene 
      assignment to Xp11.22-Xp21.1.
PG  - 97-106
AB  - Linkage analysis was performed in a family with non-specific X-linked mental 
      retardation (MRX 15). Hypotonia in infancy was the most remarkable physical 
      manifestation. The severity of mental deficiency was variable among the patients, 
      but all of them had poor or absent speech. Significant lod scores at a recombination 
      fraction of zero were detected with the marker loci DXS1126, DXS255, and DXS573 
      (Zmax = 2.01) and recombination was observed with the two flanking loci DXS164 
      (Xp21.1) and DXS988 (Xp11.22), identifying a 17 cM interval. This result suggests a 
      new gene localization in the proximal Xp region. In numerous families with 
      non-specific X-linked mental retardation (MRX), the corresponding gene has been 
      localized to the paracentromeric region in which a low recombination rate impairs 
      the precision of mapping.

TI  - Characterization of the human glutamate receptor subunit 3 gene (GRIA3), a candidate 
      for bipolar disorder and nonspecific X-linked mental retardation.
PG  - 356-68
AB  - The X-chromosome breakpoint in a female patient with a balanced translocation 
      t(X;12)(q24;q15), bipolar affective disorder and mental retardation was mapped 
      within the glutamate receptor 3 (GRIA3) gene by fluorescence in situ hybridization. 
      The GRIA3 cDNA of 5894 bp was cloned, and the gene structure and pattern of 
      expression were determined. The most abundant GRIA3 transcript is composed of 17 
      exons. An additional 5 exons (2a, 2b, 5a, 5b, and 5c) from the 5' end of the GRIA3 
      open reading frame were identified by EST analysis (ESTs AI379066 and AA947914). Two 
      new polymorphic microsatellite repeats, (TC)(n=12-26) and (AC)(n=15-19), were 
      identified within GRIA3 5' and 3'UTRs. No mutations were detected in families 
      segregating disorders mapping across GRIA3, one with X-linked bipolar affective 
      disorder (BP) and one with a nonspecific X-linked mental retardation (MRX27). To 
      assess the possibility of the involvement of the GRIA3 gene in familial cases of 
      complex BP, a large set of 373 individuals from 40 pedigrees segregating BP were 
      genotyped using closely linked (DXS1001) and intragenic (DXS1212 and GRIA3 3' UTR 
      (AC)(n))) GRIA3 STR markers. No evidence of linkage was found by parametric Lod 
      score analysis (the highest Lod score was 0. 3 at DXS1212, using the dominant 
      transmission model) or by affected sib-pair analysis.

TI  - [Psychiatric diagnostic problems of mentally retarded patients].
PG  - 318-25
AB  - Although the knowledge of psychiatric disorders appearing in course of mental 
      retardation is wider, there is still no straightforward data concerning their 
      frequency, symptomatology, and factors responsible for their appearance. 
      Symptomatology of disorders and psychiatric illnesses presented by mentally retarded 
      patients may differ from the one presented by healthy control. Nowadays it is 
      commonly considered that the same disorders and illnesses are diagnosed among 
      mentally retarded as well as among general population. THE AIM OF THE STUDY: To 
      analyze of psychopthologic symptoms observed during the admission of mentally 
      retarded patients to psychiatric hospital, to analyze comorbid psychiatric disorders 
      and stated diagnoses. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The medical documentation of patients 
      hospitalized in Babiński's Hospital in Łódź (SPZOZ) in 2006 with diagnosis of mental 
      retardation (F70-F79 according to ICD-10). The patients hospitalized throughout the 
      year 2006 with comorbid psychiatric diagnosis as well as those with only stated 
      mental retardation were taken into account. The analysis was based on questionnaire 
      specially prepared for that paper. The results were statistically analyzed. RESULTS: 
      In mentally retarded patients admitted to psychiatric hospital behavior disorders 
      were the most frequently observed ones, subsequently psychosis and impulse control 
      disorders. Psychiatric disorder were mainly demonstrated by aggression and 
      psychomotor agitation. Psychiatric disorders at mentally retarded patients are 
      expressed by nonspecific syndromes, among which the most common are aggression, mood 
      lowering, psychomotor agitation, dysphoria, irritability. CONCLUSIONS: Nonspecific 
      syndromes, communication difficulties and low prevalence of standardized diagnostic 
      methods for mentally retarded patients are the reasons for still low number of 
      precise psychiatric stated diagnoses in comparison to the described syndromes and 
      disorders. This results in treating psychiatric syndromes as the consequence of 
      mental retardation itself, not as the consequence of present psychiatric disorder.

TI  - Mapping to distal Xq28 of nonspecific X-linked mental retardation MRX72: linkage 
      analysis and clinical findings in a three-generation Sardinian family.
PG  - 376-82
AB  - Families with mentally retarded males found to be negative for FRAXA and FRAXE 
      mutations are useful in understanding the genetic basis of X-linked mental 
      retardation. According to the most recent data (updated to 1999), 69 MRX loci have 
      been mapped and 6 genes cloned. Here we report on a linkage study performed on 20 
      subjects from a 4-generation Sardinian family segregating a non-specific X-linked 
      recessive mental retardation (XLMR)(MRX72) associated with global delay of all 
      psychomotor development. Five of 8 affected males have been tested for mental age, 
      verbal and performance skills and behavioral anomalies; mental impairment ranged 
      from mild to severe. Only minor anomalies were present in the affected subjects. 
      Two-point linkage analysis based on 28 informative microsatellites spanning the 
      whole X chromosome demonstrated linkage between the disorder and markers DXS1073 and 
      F8c in Xq28 (maximum Lod score of 2. 71 at straight theta = 0.00). Multipoint 
      linkage analysis confirmed the linkage with a Z(max) of 3.0 at straight theta = 0.00 
      at DXS1073 and F8c. Recombination in an affected male at DXS1073 and F8c allowed us 
      to delimit centromerically and telomerically the region containing the putative 
      candidate gene. The region, where MRX72 maps, overlaps that of another MRX families 
      previously mapped to Xq28, two of which harbored mutations in GDI. Involvement of 
      this gene was excluded in our family, suggesting another MRX might reside in Xq28.

TI  - Linkage of nonspecific X-linked mental retardation to Xq21.31.
PG  - 436-42
AB  - Mental retardation unassociated with the Fragile X syndrome accounts for up to 60% 
      of patients with X-linked mental retardation. In this investigation, we report on a 
      family with mild non-specific X-linked mental retardation (MRX) without other 
      apparent phenotypic abnormalities. Linkage analysis on 27 relatives using 18 
      polymorphic markers spanning the X-chromosome demonstrated close linkage to DXYS1 
      with a peak LOD score of 2.14 at a theta of 0. Numerous families with various types 
      of MRX have now been studied by other investigators using molecular genetic 
      techniques. In addition to the family described in this report, a number of these 
      have demonstrated linkage to the DXYS1 locus. These data suggest that a gene for 
      mental retardation may exist in the region of DXYS1. Alternatively, this area of the 
      X-chromosome may harbor multiple different but closely linked genes which cause the 
      various types of MRX.

TI  - Deletion of the mental retardation gene Gdi1 impairs associative memory and alters 
      social behavior in mice.
PG  - 2567-80
AB  - Non-specific mental retardation (NSMR) is a common human disorder characterized by 
      mental handicap as the only clinical symptom. Among the recently identified MR genes 
      is GDI1, which encodes alpha Gdi, one of the proteins controlling the activity of 
      the small GTPases of the Rab family in vesicle fusion and intracellular trafficking. 
      We report the cognitive and behavioral characterization of mice carrying a deletion 
      of Gdi1. The Gdi1-deficient mice are fertile and anatomically normal. They appear 
      normal also in many tasks to assess spatial and episodic memory and emotional 
      behavior. Gdi1-deficient mice are impaired in tasks requiring formation of 
      short-term temporal associations, suggesting a defect in short-term memory. In 
      addition, they show lowered aggression and altered social behavior. In mice, as in 
      humans, lack of Gdi1 spares most central nervous system functions and preferentially 
      impairs only a few forebrain functions required to form temporal associations. The 
      general similarity to human mental retardation is striking, and suggests that the 
      Gdi1 mutants may provide insights into the human defect and into the molecular 
      mechanisms important for development of cognitive functions.

TI  - Severe nonspecific X-linked mental retardation caused by a proximally Xp located 
      gene: intragenic heterogeneity or a new form of X-linked mental retardation?
PG  - 172-5
AB  - X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) can be subdivided into syndromic and nonsyndromic 
      or nonspecific. Patients with non-syndromal XLMR show no characteristic 
      manifestations, biochemical defects, or distinct fragile sites. Nevertheless, 
      nonspecific XLMR seems to be heterogeneous. To determine the number and location of 
      the genes responsible for XLMR, linkage studies in large pedigrees have to be 
      performed. Here we report the data of linkage analysis in a large Brazilian family 
      with 7 patients affected by a severe form of XLMR, with no other associated 
      malformations. All the obligate carriers are normal. A close linkage without 
      recombination (lod scores 1.95 and 3.25) was found between the disease locus and 
      polymorphic DNA loci DXS255 (Xp11.22), DXS14 (Xp11.21). These results suggest that 
      the gene responsible for the disease in this family maps in the Xp11-cent of the X 
      chromosome. Positive lod scores in this region have also been reported for other 
      XLMR genealogies, but with a much milder phenotype. The possibility of intragenic or 
      locus heterogeneity is discussed.

TI  - The discovery of microdeletion syndromes in the post-genomic era: review of the 
      methodology and characterization of a new 1q41q42 microdeletion syndrome.
PG  - 607-16
AB  - PURPOSE: The advent of molecular cytogenetic technologies has altered the means by 
      which new microdeletion syndromes are identified. Whereas the cytogenetic basis of 
      microdeletion syndromes has traditionally depended on the serendipitous 
      ascertainment of a patient with established clinical features and a chromosomal 
      rearrangement visible by G-banding, comparative genomic hybridization using 
      microarrays has enabled the identification of novel, recurrent imbalances in 
      patients with mental retardation and apparently nonspecific features. Compared with 
      the "phenotype-first" approach of traditional cytogenetics, array-based comparative 
      genomic hybridization has enabled the detection of novel genomic disorders using a 
      "genotype-first" approach. We report as an illustrative example the characterization 
      of a novel microdeletion syndrome of 1q41q42. METHODS: We tested more than 10,000 
      patients with developmental disabilities by array-based comparative genomic 
      hybridization using our targeted microarray. High-resolution microarray analysis was 
      performed using oligonucleotide microarrays for patients in whom deletions of 
      1q41q42 were identified. Fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed to confirm 
      all 1q deletions in the patients and to exclude deletions or other chromosomal 
      rearrangements in the parents. RESULTS: Seven cases were found with de novo 
      deletions of 1q41q42. The smallest region of overlap is 1.17 Mb and encompasses five 
      genes, including DISP1, a gene involved in the sonic hedgehog signaling pathway, the 
      deletion of which has been implicated in holoprosencephaly in mice. Although none of 
      these patients showed frank holoprosencephaly, many had other midline defects (cleft 
      palate, diaphragmatic hernia), seizures, and mental retardation or developmental 
      delay. Dysmorphic features are present in all patients at varying degrees. Some 
      patients showed more severe phenotypes and carry the clinical diagnosis of Fryns 
      syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: This new microdeletion syndrome with its variable clinical 
      presentation may be responsible for a proportion of Fryns syndrome patients and adds 
      to the increasing number of new syndromes identified with array-based comparative 
      genomic hybridization. The genotype-first approach to identifying recurrent 
      chromosome abnormalities is contrasted with the traditional phenotype-first 
      approach. Targeting developmental pathways in a functional approach to diagnostics 
      may lead to the identification of additional microdeletion syndromes.

AB  - Objective: The DYNC1H1 gene is related to a variety of diseases, including spinal 
      muscular atrophy with lower extremity-predominant 1, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease 
      type 2O, and mental retardation, autosomal dominant13 (MRD13). Some patients with 
      DYNC1H1 variant also had epilepsy. This study aimed to detect DYNC1H1 variants in 
      Chinese patients with infantile spasms (ISs). Methods: We reviewed clinical 
      information, video electroencephalogram (V-EEG), and neuroimaging of a newly 
      identified cohort of five patients with de novo DYNC1H1gene variants. Results: Five 
      patients with four DYNC1H1variants from four families were included. All patients 
      had epileptic spasms (ESs), the median age at seizure onset was 7.5 months (range 
      from 5 months to 2 years 7 months), and the interictal V-EEG results were 
      hypsarrhythmia. Four of five patients had brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
      abnormalities. Four de novo DYNC1H1 variants were identified, including two novel 
      variants (p.N1117K, p.M3405L) and two reported variants (p.R1962C, p.F1093S). As for 
      the variant site, two variants are located in the tail domain, one variant is 
      located in the motor domain, and one variant is located in the stalk domain. All 
      patients had tried more than five kinds of antiepileptic drugs. One patient has been 
      controlled well by vigabatrin (VGB) for 4 years, and another patient by VGB and 
      steroids for 1.5 years. The other three patients still had frequent ESs. All 
      patients had severe intellectual disability and development delays. Significance: IS 
      was one of the phenotypes of DYNC1H1 variants. Most patients had non-specific brain 
      MRI abnormality. Two of four DYNC1H1 variants were novel, expanding the variant 
      spectrum. The IS phenotype was related to the variant's domains of DYNC1H1 variant 
      sites. All patients were drug-refractory and showed development delays.

TI  - Characterization of ARHGEF6, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rho GTPases 
      and a candidate gene for X-linked mental retardation: mutation screening in 
      Börjeson-Forssman-Lehmann syndrome and MRX27.
PG  - 43-8
AB  - Börjeson-Forssman-Lehmann syndrome (BFLS) is a syndromic X-linked mental retardation 
      that has been mapped by linkage to Xq26-q27. A nonsyndromic mental retardation 
      family, MRX27, has also been localized to a region of the X chromosome overlapping 
      Xq26-q27. The gene for ARHGEF6 (also known as alphaPIX or Cool-2), a newly 
      identified guanine nucleotide exchange factor, was identified as a potential 
      candidate XLMR gene, due to its location within the BFLS and MRX27 critical regions 
      and its function in the regulation of PAK3 (a known MRX gene). The full coding 
      sequence and genomic structure of the gene for ARHGEF6 was established in silico, 
      based on available genomic, EST, and cDNA sequence information. Mutation analysis in 
      BFLS- and MRX27-affected individuals was carried out. No mutations were found in two 
      BFLS families or MRX27. Although ARHGEF6 is unlikely to be the gene responsible for 
      either BFLS or MRX27, it remains a prime candidate for nonspecific or syndromic 
      mental retardation linked to Xq26.

TI  - Frailty and intellectual disability: a different operationalization?
PG  - 17-21
LID - 10.1002/ddrr.1124 [doi]
AB  - Frailty is increasingly being recognized as a relevant health measure in older 
      populations, associated with an increased risk of adverse health outcomes and care 
      dependency. Because it is generally perceived that people with intellectual 
      disabilities are "old" from age 50 onwards, frailty research in this group might 
      lead to an understanding of factors, contributing to this perception. The 
      development since the 1990s of conceptual and operational definitions of frailty has 
      resulted in different approaches: biological (phenotype), multidimensional, and 
      non-specific deficit accumulation. All approaches consider disability a consequence 
      rather than a cause of frailty. This may be different for long-disabled populations, 
      which would have consequences for validity of frailty measures. First research shows 
      that the different approaches are applicable to study populations with intellectual 
      disabilities as well. Frailty as defined by both the phenotypic and deficit 
      accumulation approach appears to develop considerably earlier and is more severe in 
      people with intellectual disabilities than in the general older population, 
      supporting the notion of early aging. Before any clinical implications can be 
      outlined, health outcomes (validity), causes, and prevention of frailty should be 
      investigated.

TI  - Mapping of a gene for nonspecific X-linked mental retardation (MRX 75) to Xq24-q26.
PG  - 290-3
AB  - Nonspecific X-linked mental retardation is a heterogeneous condition consisting of 
      nonsyndromal mental retardation in males. It is caused by mutation in one of several 
      genes on the X chromosome (MRX genes). Here we report on the localization of a 
      presumptive MRX gene to chromosomal region Xq24-q26 in a German family with 
      nonspecific X-linked mental retardation (MRX 75, HUGO Human Gene Nomenclature 
      Committee). Two point linkage analysis with 23 informative markers gave a lod score 
      of 2.53 at theta = 0 for markers DXS425, DXS1254, DXS1114, and HPRT.

TI  - Neuropathology of Rett syndrome.
PG  - 142-58
AB  - Rett syndrome is an increasingly recognized progressive disorder in females, 
      commencing in infancy and characterized by autistic behavior, gait ataxia, 
      stereotyped movements, seizures and generalized growth and mental retardation, 
      possibly associated with disorders of central biogenic amine synthesis. The gene 
      locus and pathogenesis of Rett syndrome are unknown. Autopsy studies in nine girls 
      dying between 4 and 17 years, and sural nerve and muscle biopsies from two girls 
      aged 3 and 17 years showed: (1) diffuse cortical atrophy/micrencephaly, with a 
      decrease in brain weight by 12% to 34% of age-matched controls, apparently related 
      to the duration of the disorder; (2) mild diffuse cortical atrophy with increased 
      amounts of neuronal lipofuscin and occasional mild gliosis, but without signs of a 
      storage disorder; (3) underpigmentation of the zona compacta nigrae, which showed 
      fewer well-pigmented neurons for age and fewer melanin granules per neuron, while 
      total numbers of nigral neurons and the substructure of neuromelanin were normal for 
      age. No pathological changes were seen in other transmitter-specific brain stem 
      nuclei; (4) immunoreactivity for tyrosine hydroxylase was slightly reduced in nigral 
      and hypothalamic neurons, and the pituitary gland showed decreased immunoreaction 
      for prolactin and growth hormone; (5) ultrastructurally, in frontal cortex and 
      caudate nucleus, isolated abnormal neurites and reactive or degenerative axonal 
      swellings were seen; the latter are possibly related to the nigral changes, 
      suggesting some dysfunction of the dopaminergic nigrostriatal system, which is 
      supported by neurochemical data; (6) preliminary biochemical studies revealed 
      increased beta-endorphines in thalamus and cerebellum; (7) peripheral nerves 
      demonstrated increase in small fibers without demyelination and increased numbers of 
      neurofilaments in axons, suggesting distal axonopathy, while skeletal muscle showed 
      alterations in the sarcoplasmic reticulum with circular profiles in the Z-filaments. 
      These nonspecific changes may be interpreted as early signs of denervation. The 
      variety of lesions in the central, neuroendocrine and peripheral neuromuscular 
      systems in Rett syndrome are discussed with regard to their clinical and biochemical 
      significance.

AB  - Although genetic causes of X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) are heterogeneous and 
      complex, recent concerted actions between physicians and biologists have allowed 
      some major difficulties to be overcome and led to the identification of an 
      increasing number of genes involved in these conditions. Indeed, over the past 2 
      years significant progress has been made in understanding the molecular basis 
      underlying not only XLMR, where there are distinguishing phenotypic or genetic 
      markers (syndromal forms of XLMR), but also non-specific (or idiopathic) mental 
      retardation (MRX). Recent breakthroughs have shown that genes responsible for these 
      latter conditions encode for proteins involved in signalling pathways which regulate 
      cytoskeleton organization, synaptic vesicle transport and, maybe, other cellular 
      functions. Also, they suggest a provacative picture that conceptualizes MRX as 
      disorders resulting from a dysfunctioning of genes required for processes such as 
      the remodelling, establishment and stabilization of connections between neuronal 
      cells. Such processes are crucial for the development of intellectual and cognitive 
      functions. As these functions begin to evolve mainly in post-natal stages through 
      contact with diverse stimuli and environments, a potential therapeutic approach 
      would be the development of drugs that target cellular signalling pathways shown to 
      be implicated in MRX.

TI  - Non-syndromic X linked intellectual disability: Current knowledge in light of the 
      recent advances in molecular and functional studies.
PG  - 677-687
LID - 10.1111/cge.13698 [doi]
AB  - Since the discovery of the FMR1 gene and the clinical and molecular characterization 
      of Fragile X Syndrome in 1991, more than 141 genes have been identified in the 
      X-chromosome in these 28 years thanks to applying continuously evolving molecular 
      techniques to X-linked intellectual disability (XLID) families. In the past decade, 
      array comparative genomic hybridization and next generation sequencing technologies 
      have accelerated gene discovery exponentially. Classically, XLID has been subdivided 
      in syndromic intellectual disability (S-XLID)-where intellectual disability (ID) is 
      always associated with other recognizable physical and/or neurological features-and 
      non-specific or non-syndromic intellectual disability (NS-XLID) where the only 
      common feature is ID. Nevertheless, new advances on the study of these entities have 
      showed that this classification is not always clear-cut because distinct variants in 
      several of these XLID genes can result in S-XLID as well as in NS-XLID. This review 
      focuses on the current knowledge on the XLID genes involved in non-syndromic forms, 
      with the emphasis on their pathogenic mechanism, thus allowing the possibility to 
      elucidate why some of them can give both syndromic and non-syndromic phenotypes.

PG  - 729-40
AB  - Because it is now possible to obtain high-resolution multiplanar MR imaging of the 
      cerebellum and because of the developing interest on the role of the cerebellum on 
      higher brain functions, we have decided to study the process of cerebellar 
      fissuration. All brain MRI examinations performed in children for varied 
      neurological and neurosurgical indications, especially children with non-specific 
      mental retardation and patients with cerebral malformation detected at initial 
      imaging work-up, were reviewed. Fissuration and lobulation anomalies (abnormal 
      orientation of fissures, pseudopolymicrogyria, cortical thickening, subcortical 
      cysts and heterotopia) were identified that we called cerebellar cortical dysplasia 
      (CCD). In order to better understand the origin of this malformation, current data 
      on cerebellar embryogenesis and histogenesis will be reviewed, and the pathological 
      and radiological features will be illustrated. Milder forms of CCD represent a 
      distinct group of anomalies that should be distinguished from other types of 
      cerebellar dysplasia (agenesis, hypoplasia or complex dysplasia with involvement of 
      the cerebellar vermis (rhombencephalosynapsis)) or combined cerebellar and cerebral 
      dysplasia (muscular dystrophies and lissencephaly). Recognition of cerebellar 
      cortical dysplasia could be a first step towards a broader understanding of its 
      pathogenesis and significance.

AB  - Neuropathological findings are analyzed in 299 cases from 3 state institutions for 
      mental retardation (MR) with or without cerebral palsy or seizures. Major lesions 
      were found in 127 patients (42.5%): various forms of post-hypoxic encephalopathy, 
      developmental anomalies, degenerative and metabolic diseases and post-infectious 
      encephalopathy, all showing good clinicopathological correlations. Ninety-seven 
      patients (32.5%) showed minor or non-specific lesions which could not be used to 
      make a specific etiopathogenetic diagnosis and which appeared not concordant with 
      the magnitude of the functional deficiency but nevertheless demonstrated structural 
      imperfection of the brain. This group included subtle developmental anomalies, such 
      as focal heterotopia, polymicrogyria, abnormal convolutional patterns and 
      disproportionate subunits as in Down syndrome (45 cases; 15%) and subependymal 
      germinolysis in which the etiology is varied. The most baffling and elusive group 
      consisted of 75 cases (25%) showing no significant morphological abnormalities. 
      Thirty-six of these had a history of seizures but 39 did not. The causes of MR in 
      this group are heterogenous as in the group with major morphological lesions and may 
      include unrecognized biochemical abnormalities, ultrastructural lesions, psychiatric 
      disorders or cultural factors, but many still remain conjectural. It appears that a 
      morphologically normal brain provides a potential for but does not ensure average 
      functional development, but the reverse is not always true.

TI  - X-linked mental retardation, short stature, microcephaly and hypogonadism maps to 
      Xp22.1-p21.3 in a Belgian family.
PG  - 145-52
AB  - X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) is a heterogeneous disorder that can be 
      classified as either non-specific (MRX), when mental retardation is the only 
      feature, or as syndromic mental retardation (MRXS). Genetic defects underlying XLMR 
      are being identified at a rapid pace, often starting from X-chromosomal aberrations 
      and XLMR families with a well-defined linkage interval. Here, we present a new 
      family with a syndromic form of XLMR, including mild mental retardation, short 
      stature, microcephaly and hypogonadism. Two-point linkage analysis with 24 
      polymorphic markers spanning the entire X chromosome was carried out. We could 
      assign the causative gene to a 6 cM interval in Xp22.1-p21.3, with a maximum LOD 
      score of 2.61 for markers DXS989 and DXS1061 at theta = 0.00. No mutations were 
      found in the presented family for two known MRX genes mapping to this interval, ARX 
      and IL1RAPL-1. These data indicate that the interval Xp22.1-p21.3 contains at least 
      one additional MRXS gene.

TI  - Clinical spectrum of cortical dysplasia in childhood: diagnosis and treatment 
      issues.
PG  - 759-71
AB  - Disorders of cortical development form a spectrum of lesions produced by insults to 
      the developing neocortex. These conditions typically first manifest in childhood 
      with epilepsy, developmental delay, and focal neurologic signs. Although the 
      clinical and electrophysiologic findings are often nonspecific, high-resolution 
      magnetic resonance imaging facilitates diagnosis during life, and assists in 
      delineating specific clinical syndromes. While many patients are dysmorphic and 
      severely affected by mental retardation and epilepsy, some have normal or 
      near-normal cognitive function and no seizures. Molecular studies of dysplastic 
      cortex are providing new insights into the basic mechanisms of brain function and 
      development, while pathologic analysis of tissue removed at surgery is helping to 
      define epileptic circuitry. Treatment of the epilepsy associated with cortical 
      dysplasia is often frustrating, but surgical approaches based on accurately defining 
      epileptogenic regions are proving increasingly successful. Genetic diagnosis is 
      important for accurate counseling of families.

TI  - A new locus for autosomal recessive non-syndromic mental retardation maps to 
      1p21.1-p13.3.
PG  - 212-9
AB  - Autosomal recessive inheritance of non-syndromic mental retardation (ARNSMR) may 
      account for approximately 25% of all patients with non-specific mental retardation 
      (NSMR). Although many X-linked genes have been identified as a cause of NSMR, only 
      three autosomal genes are known to cause ARNSMR. We present here a large 
      consanguineous Turkish family with four mentally retarded individuals from different 
      branches of the family. Clinical tests showed cognitive impairment but no 
      neurological, skeletal, and biochemical involvements. Genome-wide mapping using 
      Human Mapping 10K Array showed a single positive locus with a parametric LOD score 
      of 4.92 in a region on chromosome 1p21.1-p13.3. Further analyses using polymorphic 
      microsatellite markers defined a 6.6-Mb critical region containing approximately 130 
      known genes. This locus is the fourth one linked to ARNSMR.

AB  - Distal 1q21.1 microdeletions have shown highly variable clinical expressivity and 
      incomplete penetrance, with affected individuals manifesting a broad spectrum of 
      nonspecific features. The goals of this study were to better describe the phenotypic 
      spectrum of patients with distal 1q21.1 microdeletions and to compare the clinical 
      features among affected individuals. We performed a retrospective chart review of 47 
      individuals with distal 1q21.1 microdeletions tested at a large clinical genetic 
      testing laboratory, with most patients being clinically evaluated in the same 
      children's hospital. Health information such as growth charts, results of imaging 
      studies, developmental history, and progress notes were collected. Statistical 
      analysis was performed using Fisher's exact test to compare clinical features among 
      study subjects. Common features in our cohort include microcephaly (51.2%), seizures 
      (29.8%), developmental delay (74.5%), failure to thrive (FTT) (68.1%), dysmorphic 
      features (63.8%), and a variety of congenital anomalies such as cardiac 
      abnormalities (23.4%) and genitourinary abnormalities (19.1%). Compared to prior 
      literature, we found that seizures, brain anomalies, and FTT were more prevalent 
      among our study cohort. Females were more likely than males to have microcephaly (p 
      = 0.0199) and cardiac abnormalities (p = 0.0018). Based on existing genome-wide 
      clinical testing results, at least a quarter of the cohort had additional genetic 
      findings that may impact the phenotype of the individual. Our study represents the 
      largest cohort of distal 1q21.1 microdeletion carriers available in the literature 
      thus far, and it further illustrates the wide spectrum of clinical manifestations 
      among symptomatic individuals. These results may allow for improved genetic 
      counseling and management of affected individuals. Future studies may help to 
      elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms impacting the phenotypic variability 
      observed with this microdeletion.

LID - 57
AB  - BACKGROUND: Haploinsufficiency of the forkhead-box protein P1 (FOXP1) gene leads to 
      a neurodevelopmental disorder termed FOXP1 syndrome. Previous studies in individuals 
      carrying FOXP1 mutations and deletions have described the presence of autism 
      spectrum disorder (ASD) traits, intellectual disability, language impairment, and 
      psychiatric features. The goal of the present study was to comprehensively 
      characterize the genetic and clinical spectrum of FOXP1 syndrome. This is the first 
      study to prospectively examine the genotype-phenotype relationship in multiple 
      individuals with FOXP1 syndrome, using a battery of standardized clinical 
      assessments. METHODS: Genetic and clinical data was obtained and analyzed from nine 
      children and adolescents between the ages of 5-17 with mutations in FOXP1. 
      Phenotypic characterization included gold standard ASD testing and norm-referenced 
      measures of cognition, adaptive behavior, language, motor, and visual-motor 
      integration skills. In addition, psychiatric, medical, neurological, and 
      dysmorphology examinations were completed by a multidisciplinary team of clinicians. 
      A comprehensive review of reported cases was also performed. All missense and 
      in-frame mutations were mapped onto the three-dimensional structure of DNA-bound 
      FOXP1. RESULTS: We have identified nine de novo mutations, including three 
      frameshift, one nonsense, one mutation in an essential splice site resulting in 
      frameshift and insertion of a premature stop codon, three missense, and one in-frame 
      deletion. Reviewing prior literature, we found seven instances of recurrent 
      mutations and another 34 private mutations. The majority of pathogenic missense and 
      in-frame mutations, including all four missense mutations in our cohort, lie in the 
      DNA-binding domain. Through structural analyses, we show that the mutations perturb 
      amino acids necessary for binding to the DNA or interfere with the domain swapping 
      that mediates FOXP1 dimerization. Individuals with FOXP1 syndrome presented with 
      delays in early motor and language milestones, language impairment (expressive 
      language > receptive language), ASD symptoms, visual-motor integration deficits, and 
      complex psychiatric presentations characterized by anxiety, obsessive-compulsive 
      traits, attention deficits, and externalizing symptoms. Medical features included 
      non-specific structural brain abnormalities and dysmorphic features, endocrine and 
      gastrointestinal problems, sleep disturbances, and sinopulmonary infections. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies novel FOXP1 mutations associated with FOXP1 
      syndrome, identifies recurrent mutations, and demonstrates significant clustering of 
      missense mutations in the DNA-binding domain. Clinical findings confirm the role 
      FOXP1 plays in development across multiple domains of functioning. The genetic 
      findings can be incorporated into clinical genetics practice to improve accurate 
      genetic diagnosis of FOXP1 syndrome and the clinical findings can inform monitoring 
      and treatment of individuals with FOXP1 syndrome.

TI  - [Genetic causes of mental retardation--diagnostic possibilities].
PG  - 3028-34
AB  - Mental retardation is a life-long disability occurring in 2-3% of all children. 
      Genetic causes are very heterogeneous and the clinical presentation most often 
      non-specific. Current diagnostic tools can only identify a specific aetiology in 
      50-70%, and more importantly, often do not exclude a genetic cause in apparently 
      sporadic cases of mental retardation. A proven genetic aetiology has many 
      implications for the extended family. Fragile X syndrome is the most prevalent cause 
      of inherited mental retardation and occurs in 2-6% of both females and males. 
      Chromosomes and fragile X syndrome should be routinely investigated in patients with 
      mental retardation of unknown aetiology. Molecular cytogenetics (FISH) provide 
      specific diagnosis of several rare and clinically recognizable syndromes. Provision 
      of extended clinical information is critical at referral, so that the most relevant 
      investigations may be selected. Biochemical and molecular investigations can be 
      performed for an increasing number of distinct but all very rare conditions 
      associated with mental retardation. Efficient methods for simultaneous investigation 
      of a panorama of rare biochemical and molecular abnormalities are now available and 
      might improve the diagnostic yield considerably in the near future. We recommend a 
      long-term diagnostic follow-up which allows us to apply modern methods and diagnose 
      syndromes with phenotypes developing over several years.

TI  - The clinical significance of fragile sites on human chromosomes.
PG  - 157-61
AB  - Fragile X syndrome is now a well established common clinical entity and most of 
      those who are aware of the condition probably know that it takes its name from a 
      rare fragile site (FRAXA) on the X chromosome. This is the best known fragile site 
      and its clinical significance is clear. Similar, but a little less known is FRAXE, a 
      fragile site close to that associated with fragile X syndrome, but in this case 
      associated with a mild form of non-specific X-linked mental retardation. These are 
      the only two fragile sites that are unequivocally of clinical significance. A 
      fragile site within the CBL2 oncogene on chromosome 11 has been mapped very close to 
      the deletion breakpoint in a handful of patients with Jacobsen syndrome. It is 
      doubtful that parents with FRA11B are at increased risk of having children with 
      Jacobsen syndrome, but this cannot be ruled out. The common fragile sites have been 
      implicated in oncogenesis since shortly after their discovery in the early 1980s. 
      While a couple of these are within genes that have been implicated in cancer it is 
      unclear whether either the fragile sites, or the genes in which they are located are 
      important in cancer. It may be that the common fragile sites are regions of genomic 
      instability and that this instability is increased in malignant cells, analogous to 
      the enhanced instability seen at microsatellite loci in a number of tumours. Since 
      we all have the common fragile sites there is no suggestion that they give anyone an 
      increased risk of developing malignant disease. In dealing with patients who are 
      found to have fragile sites, other than FRAXA, FRAXE and possibly FRA11B, 
      considerable reassurance can be given that they are not at increased risk of having 
      children with congenital disease or developing disease themselves because of their 
      fragile sites.

AB  - This study presents an integrative review of the scientific literature and federal 
      legislation on public health policies for intellectually disabled in Brazil. Nine 
      articles, published in the PubMed, Scopus, Virtual Health Library and Web of Science 
      databases between 2002 and 2012, were selected. Based on the references of these 
      studies, 6 other articles were identified, totaling 15 studies in the review. 
      Forty-one federal laws produced between 2002 and 2012 were identified. The documents 
      were analyzed and categorized according to the main themes of socioeconomic 
      conditions, violence, mental health, ethics, health needs, health promotion and 
      prevention. From the scientific standpoint, non-specific discussions were observed 
      where intellectual disability was examined with other types of handicaps or 
      concomitantly with other Latin American countries. From the legal standpoint, 
      although laws related to health have been located, there is a lack of studies that 
      address the effectiveness and level of implementation of the proposed policies. The 
      increase in research in this area is a demand of the disabled population itself, and 
      will reveal their specific health needs, and will also support issues such as 
      prevention, promotion, diagnosis and treatment.

TI  - Identification by STS PCR screening of a microdeletion in Xp21.3-22.1 associated 
      with non-specific mental retardation.
PG  - 977-9
AB  - X-linked non-specific mental retardation (MRX) is a heterogeneous condition in which 
      mental retardation (MR) appears to be the only consistent manifestation. The genetic 
      and phenotypic heterogeneity exclude any possibility of pooling families and, 
      therefore, of fine-mapping the related disease genes. In order to identify genomic 
      critical regions involved in the MRX condition assigned to Xp21.3-22.1 region, we 
      have implemented the PCR screening of non fragile X MR patients for the presence of 
      deletions in this region. The amplification by PCR of 12 markers located between 
      POLA and DXS704 using genomic DNA from 192 MR males led to the identification, in a 
      9 year old mentally retarded boy, of a microdeletion which extends from DXS1202 to 
      DXS1065. None of the known genes, POLA, MAGE genes cluster, DAX1, GK and DMD, that 
      map in the Xp21.3-22.1 region is affected by this deletion. This approach, which 
      could easily be applied to several other MRX loci, allowed not only a confirmation 
      of the presence of a potential locus in Xp21.3-22.1 involved in non-specific mental 
      retardation, but also a better definition of the genomic critical region 
      corresponding to this locus.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent technological advances have improved the understanding and 
      identification of the genetic basis of intellectual disability (ID) and global 
      developmental delay (GDD). Next-generation sequencing panels of ID genes are now 
      available for clinical testing; however, their overall yield in clinical practice 
      has not yet been investigated. AIM: We determined the diagnostic yield of ID gene 
      panels in a clinical setting and explored whether any clinical features are 
      associated with an increased diagnostic yield. METHODS: We performed a systematic 
      retrospective chart review of all patients with ID/GDD who underwent an ID gene 
      panel between April 2014 and July 2017 at our institution. Chi-square analysis 
      assessed whether any specific clinical features were significantly associated with a 
      positive diagnostic yield. RESULTS: Forty-eight subjects (18 females, 30 males; 
      median age: 7.5 years) were included. Consanguinity was present in 17%, autism in 
      38%, seizures in 42%, nonspecific dysmorphic features in 67%, and abnormalities on 
      neurological examination in 56%; furthermore, 29% of the cohort was nonverbal and 4% 
      was nonambulatory. Four different gene panels were used. The diagnostic yield was 
      21% (10/48) overall, and 38% with the more recent trio-based panel. Eight of 10 
      patients had de novo pathogenic dominant mutations, one had an inherited pathogenic 
      autosomal dominant mutation, and one had compound heterozygous pathogenic recessive 
      mutations. No clinical feature was significantly associated with an increased 
      diagnostic yield. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that ID gene panels have a high 
      yield and are a valuable diagnostic tool in the evaluation of children with ID/GDD.

TI  - Mapping of a gene for non-specific X linked mental retardation: evidence for linkage 
      to chromosomal region Xp21.1-Xp22.3.
PG  - 866-9
AB  - Linkage analysis of a non-specific form of X linked mental retardation (MRX) was 
      performed with 16 polymorphic markers spanning the entire X chromosome in a three 
      generation Italian family, including four male patients with moderate mental 
      retardation. One obligate carrier woman had mild mental retardation and another two 
      had normal intelligence. The results indicate tight linkage to DNA markers DXS84 
      (L754), DXS164 (pERT87-15), and DXS278 (CRI-S232). A maximum lod score of 2.11 at 
      theta = 0.00 was obtained with DXS164 and DXS278. The linked region spanned 
      chromosomal bands Xp21.1-Xp22.3, that is, the same portion of the X chromosome where 
      MRX2 and MRX10-13 have been previously localised.

LID - 10.1016/j.braindev.2019.03.009 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: EAST syndrome comprises of epilepsy, ataxia, sensorineural deafness, and 
      tubulopathy. It is caused by a mutation in KCNJ10 gene. Less than thirty cases have 
      been reported in the literature with emphasis on genetic mutation and renal 
      tubulopathy. In this article, our goal is to present a comprehensive description of 
      epilepsy and its management. A literature review is also presented to consolidate 
      and compare our findings with the previously reported cases. METHODS: Retrospective 
      chart review was done to collect patient data. Research clinic was organized to 
      obtain missing data. Molecular genetic testing was done at the CGC Genetics 
      Laboratory. Electroencephalogram (EEG) was done for all patients and interpreted by 
      a pediatric epileptologist and brain MRI was reviewed by a pediatric 
      neuroradiologist. Developmental assessment was done by a developmental pediatrician 
      using Griffiths Mental Developmental Scale. RESULTS: In patients with EAST syndrome, 
      seizure is the first symptom occurring around 3-4 months of age. Most common seizure 
      type was generalized tonic clonic (GTC). Usually, the seizures were brief lasting 
      <3 min but few patients also presented with status epilepticus especially when the 
      medication was weaned. Carbamazepine (CBZ) was found to be effective in most cases. 
      Lamotrigine (LTG), valproic acid (VPA), and topiramate (TPM) were also found to be 
      helpful. Routine EEGs were usually normal or showed non-specific findings. In few 
      patients, EEG showed background slowing. Brain MRI revealed hyperintensity in the 
      dentate nuclei in some patients, and quantitative volumetric analysis studies showed 
      volume loss in different regions of the brain especially the cerebellum. All our 
      five patients have the same homozygous c.170C>T (p.Thr57Ile) missense mutation in 
      KCNJ10 gene. CONCLUSION: This article provides the readers with an understanding of 
      the natural history of epilepsy in this syndrome to help in early recognition, avoid 
      unnecessary investigations, and provide the best treatment for seizures. It also 
      helps the physicians to share the prognosis of this rare syndrome with the parents.

      Xp11.3-q22.3.
PG  - 286-9
AB  - By using several microsatellite markers scattered along the X chromosome, we studied 
      a Chinese family with nonspecific X-linked mental retardation (MRX84) to search for 
      a region including the MRX84 locus that was linked to the markers. Two-point linkage 
      analysis demonstrated linkage between the disorder and several markers located at 
      Xq22.2, with maximum LOD score Z(max) = 2.41 at recombination fraction theta = 0 for 
      DXS1191 and DXS1230, respectively. Recombination events were observed with flanking 
      markers DXS8080 and DXS456, located at Xp11.3 and Xq22.3, respectively, and a region 
      of approximately 22.3 cM was defined. Accordingly, markers distal to Xp11.3 and 
      Xq22.3 segregated independently of the disease. The localized region observed in 
      this Chinese family overlaps with 29 other MRX loci previously reported in 
      Xp11.3-q22.3. These results should contribute to the identification of the disease 
      gene for the MRX84 disorder.

TI  - The clinical phenotype in institutionalised adult males with X-linked mental 
      retardation (XLMR).
PG  - 47-55
AB  - In an institutionalised population of 471 mentally retarded adult residents (436 
      males and 35 females), 22 males (i.e. 5 % of the male population) had XLMR, 
      accounting for 36.1 % of the residents diagnosed with a monogenic disorder (n = 61). 
      Fragile X syndrome (FRAXA) was diagnosed in 16 residents, X-linked mental 
      retardation with marfanoid habitus (Lujan-Fryns syndrome) in 2, and non-specific 
      X-linked mental retardation (MRX) in 4 males. The 4 MRX-patients included 3 male 
      sibs of a family, carrying a mutation in the IL-1 receptor accessory protein-like 
      gene, and one male patient member of the MRX-44 family (linkage with LOD-score of 
      2.90). In the group of 215 males with idiopathic mental retardation (MR), family 
      histories and pedigree data were compatible with XLMR in 35 males (35/215 = 16.3 %) 
      from 32 families. Of these 35 males, 5.7 % were microcephalic with dysmorphic 
      features and 5.7 % macrocephalic; micro-orchidism and macro-orchidism were each 
      found in 11.4 %. One macrocephalic male had also macro-orchidism and dysmorphic 
      features. In this study, the diagnosis of XLMR could thus be proposed in 57 males 
      i.e. 13.1 % of the total male population. The clinical phenotype, behavioural 
      problems and follow-up data in these different subgroups of XLMR are presented.

TI  - Sequence variants within exon 1 of MECP2 occur in females with mental retardation.
PG  - 355-60
AB  - A new splice variant of the Rett syndrome gene, MECP2, was recently identified, that 
      includes coding sequence from exon 1, and is the predominant transcript in the 
      central nervous system. This sequence encodes polyalanine and polyglycine stretches 
      within the N-terminal portion of MeCP2, and may confer novel functional properties 
      to the protein. We screened autism, mental retardation (MR), and control populations 
      for sequence variation within this region, and identified variation in approximately 
      1% of MR cases screened (N = 1,410). No variants were identified in the autism 
      sample (N = 401). Most of these variants occur within a trinucleotide repeat region 
      and result in change in number of alanine or glycine residues within the repeat 
      stretches. We suggest some of these variants may be a relatively frequent cause of 
      non-specific MR or developmental delay.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Integrative research review infers generalizations about a substantive 
      subject, summarizes the accumulated knowledge that research has left unresolved and 
      generates a new framework on these issues. Due to methodological issues emerging 
      from working memory (WM) studies in the population with non-specific intellectual 
      disability (NSID) (N=64) between 1990-2014, it is difficult to conclude on WM 
      performance in this population. AIM: This integrative research review aimed to 
      resolve literature conflicts on WM performance among individuals with NSID and to 
      identify the conditions/moderators that govern their WM performance compared to 
      controls with Typical development. METHOD/PROCEDURE: We used the six stages of 
      integrative research review: problem formulation, data collection, evaluation, data 
      analysis, results, interpretation and discussion. OUTCOMES AND RESULTS: The findings 
      indicate two types of moderators that determine WM performance in the population 
      with NSID: Participants' moderators (criteria for matching the ID and TD groups, CA 
      and MA), and task moderators [the three WM components of Baddeley and Hitch's (1974) 
      model and task load]. Only an interaction between the two moderators determines WM 
      performance in this population. The findings indicate a hierarchy (from more to less 
      preserved) in WM performance of individuals with NSID: The visuospatial tasks, then 
      some of the executive functions tasks, and the phonological loop tasks being less 
      preserved. Furthermore, at a low level of control, the performance of participants 
      with NSID was preserved beyond the modality and vice versa. CONCLUSIONS AND 
      IMPLICATIONS: Modality and MA/intelligence determine WM performance of individuals 
      with ID. Educators should prepare intervention programs take the impact of the two 
      moderators into account.

TI  - Cognitive impairment in neurofibromatosis type 1.
PG  - 45-52
AB  - Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is associated with a broad range of relatively 
      nonspecific cognitive impairments, including low IQ, learning disabilities, and 
      behavioral difficulties. While early studies indicated that the cognitive phenotype 
      of NF1 resembles that of nonverbal learning disabilities (NLD), later research has 
      found that the impairments are broader and do not fit the NLD profile well. 
      Language-based deficits and executive dysfunction have also been found in empirical 
      studies. There is some evidence that neuropsychological impairment may be correlated 
      with the underlying central nervous system involvement of NF1, but this theory has 
      not been consistently supported across studies. Further work clarifying the 
      cognitive phenotype of NF1 is needed, especially investigations that employ 
      appropriate comparison groups matched for intellectual level. Am. J. Med. Genet.

TI  - Familial X-linked mental retardation, verbal disability, and marker X chromosomes.
PG  - 214-22
AB  - Cytogenetic and verbal studies were done on members of four families with 
      non-specific X-linked mental retardation. Cytogenetic analysis was done using media 
      199 and GTG-banding; one family had a marker X with a fragile site in band Xq27 or 
      28. Preliminary results indicate variation of culture conditions can effect the 
      frequency of the marker X. A generalized language disability was found which tended 
      to concentrate in the areas of auditory reception, auditory sequential memory, 
      visual closure and grammatic closure. Articulation errors involved the same sounds 
      which are late in normal development and occur most frequently in both the general 
      population and a Down syndrome population.

TI  - Isolation of mouse neuritic mRNAs.
PG  - 79-86
AB  - Impaired local protein translation at postsynaptic sites has been hypothesized to be 
      the cause of several neurological disorders such as fragile X syndrome, 
      neurofibromatosis-1, Rett syndrome, and other syndromic and non-specific forms of 
      mental retardation. Identification of which mRNAs are present in dendrites and the 
      identification of the molecular pathways that they promote will be imperative to the 
      understanding of the neuropathology of these diseases. Since mouse models are the 
      most widely used animal models of human diseases we developed a cell culture based 
      technique to isolate mRNAs from mouse neurites.

TI  - Pericentromeric genes for non-specific X-linked mental retardation (MRX).
PG  - 553-64
AB  - Extensive linkage analyses in three families with non-specific X-linked mental 
      retardation (MRX) have localized the gene in each family to the pericentromeric 
      region of the chromosome. The MRX17 gene is localized with a peak lod of 2.41 (theta 
      = 0.0) with the trinucleotide repeat polymorphism at the androgen receptor (AR) gene 
      locus. This gene lies in the interval between the markers DXS255 and DXS990, as 
      defined by recombinants. The MRX18 gene maps to the interval between the markers 
      DXS538 and DXS1126, with a peak lod score of 2.01 (theta = 0.0) at the PFC gene 
      locus. In the third family (Family E) with insufficient informative meioses for 
      assignment of an MRX acronym, the maximum lod score is 1.8 at a recombination 
      fraction of zero for several marker loci between DXS207 and DXS426. Exclusions from 
      the regions of marker loci spanning Xq support the localization of the MRX gene in 
      Family E to the pericentromeric region. Localizations of these and other MRX genes 
      have determined that MRX2 and MRX19 map to distal Xp, MRX3, and MRX6 map to distal 
      Xq, whilst the majority cluster in the pericentromeric region. In addition, we 
      confirm that there are at least two distinct MRX genes near the centromere as 
      delineated by the non-overlapping regional localizations of MRX17 and MRX18. 
      Determination of these non-overlapping localizations is currently the only means of 
      classifying non-syndromal forms of mental retardation and determining the minimum 
      number of MRX loci.

TI  - Mutations in ARHGEF6, encoding a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rho GTPases, 
      in patients with X-linked mental retardation.
PG  - 247-50
AB  - X-linked forms of mental retardation (XLMR) include a variety of different disorders 
      and may account for up to 25% of all inherited cases of mental retardation. So far, 
      seven X-chromosomal genes mutated in nonspecific mental retardation (MRX) have been 
      identified: FMR2, GDI1, RPS6KA3, IL1RAPL, TM4SF2, OPHN1 and PAK3 (refs 2-9). The 
      products of the latter two have been implicated in regulation of neural plasticity 
      by controlling the activity of small GTPases of the Rho family. Here we report the 
      identification of a new MRX gene, ARHGEF6 (also known as alphaPIX or Cool-2), 
      encoding a protein with homology to guanine nucleotide exchange factors for Rho 
      GTPases (Rho GEF). Molecular analysis of a reciprocal X/21 translocation in a male 
      with mental retardation showed that this gene in Xq26 was disrupted by the 
      rearrangement. Mutation screening of 119 patients with nonspecific mental 
      retardation revealed a mutation in the first intron of ARHGEF6 (IVS1-11T-->C) in all 
      affected males in a large Dutch family. The mutation resulted in preferential 
      skipping of exon 2, predicting a protein lacking 28 amino acids. ARHGEF6 is the 
      eighth MRX gene identified so far and the third such gene to encode a protein that 
      interacts with Rho GTPases.

AB  - Background Obesity has become one of the greatest health risks worldwide. Recently, 
      there was an explosion of information regarding the role of the central nervous 
      system (CNS) in the development of monogenic and syndromic obesity. Case 
      presentation Over the last decade, terminal and interstitial submicroscopic 
      deletions of copy number variants (CNVs) in 2p25.3 and single nucleotide variants 
      (SNVs) in myelin transcription factor 1 like (MYT1L) were detected by genome-wide 
      array analysis and whole exome sequencing (WES) in patients with a nonspecific 
      clinical phenotype that commonly includes intellectual disability (ID), early onset 
      of obesity and speech delay. Here, we report the first Saudi female patient with 
      mild to moderate ID, early onset of obesity and speech delay associated with a de 
      novo pathogenic SNV in the MYT1L gene (c. 1585G>A [Gly529Arg]), which causes an 
      amino acid change from Gly to Arg at position 529 that leads to mental retardation, 
      autosomal dominant 39.

TI  - A novel HIST1HE pathogenic variant in a girl with macrocephaly and intellectual 
      disability: a new case and review of literature.
PG  - 39-43
LID - 10.1097/MCD.0000000000000352 [doi]
AB  - Pathogenic variants of HIST1H1Egene have recently been associated with a condition 
      known as Rahman syndrome, characterized by overgrowth, intellectual disability and 
      nonspecific dysmorphic features (high hairline, full cheeks, wide nasal bridge). 
      Wide clinical variability is reported, especially regarding the level of 
      neurodevelopment delay and intellectual disability. We report a 10-year-old girl 
      with macrocephaly and global developmental delay, in whom a novel heterozygous 
      variant in the HIST1H1Egene [c.392_395dup (p.Gly133fs)] was discovered, but 
      involving the same C-terminal domain-protein domain reported previously. Comparing 
      the clinical data of our patient with those previously described, a 'core phenotype' 
      with macrocephaly, psychomotor delay/intellectual disability and mild facial 
      dysmorphisms seems evident.

TI  - Intragenic deletions of IL1RAPL1: Report of two cases and review of the literature.
PG  - 372-9
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.a.33656 [doi]
AB  - IL1RAPL1 (interleukin-1 receptor accessory protein-like 1) located at Xp21.3-22.1 
      has repeatedly been shown to be deleted in patients with a contiguous gene syndrome 
      also affecting neighboring genes, in particular DMD (dystrophin), DAX-1 (NR0B1, 
      nuclear receptor subfamily 0, group B, member 1), and GK (glycerol kinase). In 
      contrast, intragenic deletions of IL1RAPL1 or other mutations or cytogenetic 
      aberrations affecting IL1RAPL1 have only rarely been identified. Up to date, they 
      have mostly been associated with nonspecific mental retardation (MRX). We report on 
      two nonrelated patients with MR and additional dysmorphic features who both show 
      intragenic deletions of IL1RAPL1, one of them being de novo (exon 2) and the other 
      one being inherited from his mother (exons 3-5). Deletions were identified by 
      microarray-based chromosome analysis and confirmed by multiplex PCR and FISH, 
      respectively. These data, along with recent functional studies indicating its role 
      in neuronal development, provide further evidence for the relevance of IL1RAPL1 in 
      the pathogenesis of X-linked MR and add knowledge to the phenotypic spectrum of 
      IL1RAPL1 mutations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Research data documenting a high risk of insecure and disorganized 
      attachment among children with intellectual disability (ID) in infancy and early 
      childhood raises the question of mutual influences between ID and attachment in 
      later childhood. AIMS: The objectives of the present study were to examine 
      attachment among school-age children with ID and whether attachment varies according 
      to level of intellectual functioning, adaptative functioning, and presence of a 
      genetic syndrome (i.e. Down syndrome). METHODS: Attachment among 54 children with ID 
      aged 8-12 years (30 with Down Syndrome, 24 with non-specific ID) was assessed using 
      the Attachment Story Completion Task, and compared with that of 108 typically 
      developing children, 54 of the same chronological age and 54 of the same mental age. 
      OUTCOMES: Results show (1) less security among children with ID than among same-age 
      controls (2) more disorganization among children with ID compared to the two control 
      groups, (3) a link between attachment disorganization and level of adaptive 
      functioning among children with ID and (4) no difference in attachment between 
      children with DS and children with non-specific ID. CONCLUSIONS: Children with ID 
      remain vulnerable to disorganization during late childhood. More research is needed 
      to understand the factors underlying disorganized attachment representations.

TI  - [Linkage analysis of six Algerian families with autosomal recessive non specific 
      mental retardation].
PG  - 466-70
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mental retardation is one of the most frequent major handicap, with a 
      1-3 % frequency in the general population. The recent progress of molecular biology 
      and cytogenetic allowed to identify new genes for non syndromic autosomal recessive 
      mental retardation. AIM: To seek a genetic linkage to the loci implied in the 
      nonspecific mental retardation transmitted into autosomal recessive (ARNSMR) in 
      Algerian families with several affected members and to make the Genetic analysis of 
      ARNSMR for 4 known loci: 3p25-pter; 4q24- q25, 19p13.12 and 1p21.1-p13. METHODS: The 
      study concerned 34 individuals including 15 patients, belonging to six 
      consanguineous Algerian families. Genotyping was made using polymorphic 
      microsatellite markers and the analysis carried out thanks to the program Gene 
      Mapper software. Statistical analyses were validated using the Fast Link programme 
      of the Easy linkage software (V4:00 betas). RESULTS: The study carried out made it 
      possible to exclude linkage of all loci for 3 families, nevertheless the linkage of 
      one family to the locus 1p21.1-p13.3 remains possible. CONCLUSION: The absence of 
      linkage of 4 Algerian families with autosomal recessive mental retardation to 3 well 
      known loci, confirms the genetic heterogeneity of mental retardation. We have to 
      pursue research of candidate genes by whole genome scan.

TI  - Does a peculiar EEG pattern exist also for FRAXE mental retardation?
PG  - 1632-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: FRAXE mental retardation, a recently identified rare genetic condition, 
      is due to a mutation of the FMR2 gene, located at Xq28 region. The phenotype is 
      non-specific and characterized by developmental delay, speech, reading and writing 
      problems, poor adaptive skills, anxiety, aggressiveness, obsessive-compulsive 
      disturbance, and hyperactivity. The objective of this study was to describe the 
      characteristic EEG pattern found in one patient with FRAXE mental retardation. 
      METHODS: EEG (with photic stimulation and hand/foot tapping) and median nerve 
      somatosensory evoked potentials were recorded in a 8-year-old male patient with 
      FRAXE mental retardation (diagnosis confirmed by molecular genetic analysis) and 
      speech disturbances. RESULTS: The patient never presented seizures; however, sleep 
      enhanced multifocal spikes were found in the EEG. Moreover, tactile stimulation of 
      hands and feet, as well as intermittent photic stimulation, provoked the appearance 
      of spikes. Somatosensory evoked potentials from the median nerves showed a 'giant' 
      component at around 60 ms. CONCLUSIONS: Considering the rarity of both FRAXE mental 
      retardation and tactile evoked spikes, their association in the same subject might 
      be considered as not casual. If confirmed by future studies, these 
      neurophysiological findings might be considered as a marker for FRAXE mental 
      retardation.

      retardation (Martin-Bell or Renpenning syndrome).
PG  - 417-32
AB  - With the exception of macro-orchidism, three families with X-linked mental 
      retardation showed diagnostic concordance of clinical features among the affected 
      males. Since macro-orchidism was a variable feature among the otherwise identically 
      affected males in one family, we question the existence of a separate entity of 
      X-linked mental retardation characterized only be testicular enlargement. The X 
      chromosome marker of Lubs was expressed, under the culture conditions of Sutherland, 
      in lymphocytes of the affected males of two families, one with and the other without 
      megalotestes. Two affected members of the third family, with megalotestes, did not 
      show the marker. Telomeric structural changes similar to the mar(X) (qter) formation 
      were found on certain autosomes, notably, chromosome 6 in some of the affected 
      males, potential and obligate carrier females, and in both related and unrelated 
      normal males. These autosomal markers appear to represent a nonspecific response to 
      either in vivo or in vitro folate deficiency. Caution against premature introduction 
      of this test for prenatal diagnosis, in the face of current ignorance regarding 
      diagnostic specificity, is urged.

TI  - Assessing fears and related anxieties in children and adolescents with learning 
      disabilities or mild mental retardation.
PG  - 445-57
AB  - The purpose of the present study was to examine self-reported fears and related 
      anxieties in children and adolescents (7-18 years of age) having learning 
      disabilities (LD) or mild mental retardation (MIMR), and whether these fears and 
      related anxieties differ based on gender and age. Students responded to two well 
      validated instruments, The Fear Survey Schedule for Children-Revised and Revised 
      Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale. The results revealed age, gender, and disability 
      interaction effects. Adolescent boys having mild mental retardation reported highest 
      levels of fear related to failure and criticism, a finding that was different from 
      those reported in previous studies. In addition, girls reported higher levels than 
      boys of total fear, fears related to minor injury and small animals, and 
      worry/oversensitivity. Age main effects were also observed where younger students 
      from both the LD and the MIMR groups reported higher levels of non-specific general 
      anxiety. Implications and directions for future research were presented.

TI  - In search of the MRX genes.
PG  - 221-7
AB  - Mental retardation (MR) is one of the most common human disorders. MR may be just 
      one of the clinical signs of a complex syndrome or it may be associated with 
      metabolic disorders or with disorders of brain development, but in many patients 
      [nonspecific MR (NSMR)], it is the only consistent clinical manifestation. It is 
      expected that NSMR is caused by alterations in molecular pathways important for 
      cognitive functions. Insights into NSMR have recently come from the study of 
      X-linked MR as eight genes were identified during the last few years. This 
      development has represented a fundamental breakthrough in our understanding of NSMR 
      and of cognitive functions and has opened new perspectives in the study of MR. The 
      new genes identified are a heterogeneous group, but it is very intriguing that they 
      are all directly or indirectly involved in signaling pathways and that the majority 
      are proteins that regulate members of the Ras superfamily of small GTP binding 
      proteins.

      syndrome: A new case and review of the literature.
PG  - 52-62
LID - 10.1111/ahg.12448 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gabriele-de Vries syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant genetic disease 
      caused by de novo pathogenic variants in YY1. In this study, we report a 10-year-old 
      boy with a de novo novel pathogenic variant in YY1, the first Iranian patient with 
      Gabriele-de Vries Syndrome. METHODS: The novel de novo pathogenic variant detected 
      in this study (NM_003403:c.690delA, p.Glu231Ilefs*25) was identified by whole-exome 
      sequencing and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. RESULTS: The proband presented with 
      delayed motor and speech development, ataxia, abnormal gait, autistic behavior, 
      brain atrophy, and severe learning disability. Finally, we provide a case-based 
      review of the clinical features associated with Gabriele-de Vries Syndrome. Thus 
      far, merely 13 Gabriele-de Vries Syndrome patients have been reported in the 
      literature. CONCLUSION: The investigations for a suspected case of Gabriele-de Vries 
      Syndrome must involve molecular diagnosis of the disease and its underlying genetic 
      defect because the clinical investigations are generally variable and nonspecific.

PG  - 501-6
AB  - X-linked nonspecific mental retardation (MRX) related genes are a group of 
      extensively studied genes whose mutation or deletion results in simple phenotypes of 
      generalized or specific cognitive impairment in patients, such as, low intelligence 
      and poor social adaptability. Studying the biological and cognitive functions of MRX 
      related genes means much not only to the discovery of the genetic basis for 
      non-specific MR, but also to the exploration into a new field of research about the 
      molecular basis of human cognitive function. This paper summarizes recent progress 
      on MRX studies, the current status and the prospect of this field.

      synthesis defect.
PG  - 540-3
AB  - Recently, 3 patients with a creatine synthesis defect have been described. They 
      presented with developmental regression, extrapyramidal movement abnormalities, and 
      intractable epilepsy, and they improved with treatment of creatine monohydrate. We 
      report 2 unrelated boys with a creatine synthesis defect and nonspecific presenting 
      signs of psychomotor retardation, behavioral problems, and, in 1, mild epilepsy. 
      Metabolic urine screening revealed elevations in all metabolites, expressed as 
      millimoles per mole of creatinine, which suggests decreased creatinine excretion. 
      This finding led to the correct diagnosis. We propose to include the assessment of 
      the overall concentrations of amino acids and organic acids relative to creatinine 
      in routine metabolic urine screening.

AB  - CGG repeat expansions in the 5' noncoding region of the fragile X mental retardation 
      1 gene (FMR1) give rise to both neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative human 
      diseases depending on the length of the expansion. Expansions beyond 200 repeats 
      (full mutation) generally result in gene silencing and fragile X syndrome (FXS), the 
      leading heritable form of cognitive impairment and autism. Smaller expansions 
      (55-200 CGG repeats; "premutation") give rise to the neurodegenerative disorder 
      fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) through an entirely distinct, 
      toxic mRNA gain-of-function mechanism. A rapid means for both high-risk and newborn 
      screening for allele size would provide a greater opportunity for early intervention 
      and family counseling as well as furnish critical data on repeat size distribution 
      and expanded allele frequencies. In the current work, we propose a novel mass 
      spectrometry (MS) based method for the rapid identification of expanded CGG repeats 
      to complement a recently described polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method for large 
      population screening. In this combined approach, the optimized PCR method is used to 
      amplify the relevant region of FMR1, followed by extensive nonspecific nuclease 
      digestion. The resulting oligonucleotides are analyzed by MS in a manner that 
      provides the relative proportion of triplet repeat oligonucleotides in seconds per 
      sample. This assay enables swift and reproducible detection of expanded CGG alleles 
      using a single blood spot and in principle is suitable for large scale studies and 
      newborn screening. Moreover, this analytical scheme establishes a unique new 
      intersection of MS with molecular biology, with potential for significant 
      interdisciplinary impact.

      with mental retardation who attended the Genetic clinic. Using defined clinical 
      criteria, 55 patients were selected for cytogenetic studies to detect folate 
      sensitive fragile sites. Twenty patients were diagnosed to have the fragile X 
      syndrome. The prevalence of fragile X (A) syndrome was 18 per 1,000 patients of both

TI  - Mental retardation in a boy with congenital adrenal hypoplasia: a clue to contiguous 
      gene syndrome involving DAX1 and IL1RAPL.
PG  - 303-7
AB  - We report on a 2 years and 9 months old Japanese boy with adrenal hypoplasia and 
      mental retardation (MR) (developmental quotient approximately 60) which occurred in 
      the absence of severe adrenal crisis and resultant brain damage. Cytogenetic and 
      molecular studies were performed in this boy and his parents with normal phenotype, 
      showing that the boy had a maternally derived approximately 2 Mb interstitial Xp 
      deletion involving DAX1 (DSS-AHC critical region on the X chromosome, gene 1) for 
      adrenal hypoplasia congenita and disrupting IL1RAPL (interleukin-1 receptor 
      accessory protein-like) for non-specific MR. The results explain the development of 
      MR in this boy in terms of contiguous gene syndrome, and suggest the importance of 
      IL1RAPL analysis in patients with adrenal hypoplasia and MR.

TI  - BCOR analysis in patients with OFCD and Lenz microphthalmia syndromes, mental 
      retardation with ocular anomalies, and cardiac laterality defects.
PG  - 1325-35
LID - 10.1038/ejhg.2009.52 [doi]
AB  - Oculofaciocardiodental (OFCD) and Lenz microphthalmia syndromes form part of a 
      spectrum of X-linked microphthalmia disorders characterized by ocular, dental, 
      cardiac and skeletal anomalies and mental retardation. The two syndromes are 
      allelic, caused by mutations in the BCL-6 corepressor gene (BCOR). To extend the 
      series of phenotypes associated with pathogenic mutations in BCOR, we sequenced the 
      BCOR gene in patients with (1) OFCD syndrome, (2) putative X-linked ('Lenz') 
      microphthalmia syndrome, (3) isolated ocular defects and (4) laterality phenotypes. 
      We present a new cohort of females with OFCD syndrome and null mutations in BCOR, 
      supporting the hypothesis that BCOR is the sole molecular cause of this syndrome. We 
      identify for the first time mosaic BCOR mutations in two females with OFCD syndrome 
      and one apparently asymptomatic female. We present a female diagnosed with isolated 
      ocular defects and identify minor features of OFCD syndrome, suggesting that OFCD 
      syndrome may be mild and underdiagnosed. We have sequenced a cohort of males 
      diagnosed with putative X-linked microphthalmia and found a mutation, p.P85L, in a 
      single case, suggesting that BCOR mutations are not a major cause of X-linked 
      microphthalmia in males. The absence of BCOR mutations in a panel of patients with 
      non-specific laterality defects suggests that mutations in BCOR are not a major 
      cause of isolated heart and laterality defects. Phenotypic analysis of OFCD and Lenz 
      microphthalmia syndromes shows that in addition to the standard diagnostic criteria 
      of congenital cataract, microphthalmia and radiculomegaly, patients should be 
      examined for skeletal defects, particularly radioulnar synostosis, and 
      cardiac/laterality defects.

TI  - Empathy and response to distress in children with Down syndrome.
PG  - 424-31
AB  - BACKGROUND: Most studies of empathy have focused on young children, and those who 
      are typically developing. Thus, we know little about the emergence and manifestation 
      of empathy in non-normally developing children. METHOD: Empathy and response to 
      distress in others were examined in 30 children with Down syndrome, 22 children with 
      nonspecific etiologies of mental retardation, and 22 typically developing children. 
      RESULTS: Results indicated that compared to the other children, children with Down 
      syndrome responded to distress in others by looking to them more, and offering more 
      comfort in the form of prosocial responses. However, in a hypothetical empathy 
      situation, children with Down syndrome were less likely to feel the same emotion as 
      the protagonist than were the typical children. Children with Down syndrome differed 
      from the children with nonspecific mental retardation only in their response to 
      distress in others. The children with nonspecific mental retardation were more 
      similar to than different from the MA-matched typical children. CONCLUSIONS: These 
      results suggest some etiology-associated differences in empathy and response to 
      distress in children with mental retardation.

TI  - Linkage analysis in a large family with nonspecific X-linked mental retardation.
PG  - 240-3
AB  - We report on a large 5-generation family with "nonspecific" X-linked mental 
      retardation. Nine living affected males have an IQ between 50 and 70 but have normal 
      stature, facial appearance, and testicular volumes and no other abnormalities. Two 
      obligate carrier females had borderline intellectual abilities and 
      visual-psychomotor difficulties similar to those seen in affected males. Results of 
      chromosome studies, including fragile X, were normal in males and females. Linkage 
      analysis was undertaken, with 19 X-specific chromosomal restriction fragment length 
      polymorphisms (RFLPs), giving a maximal LOD score of 1.60 at a 0.10 recombination 
      fraction for F9, suggesting a localization to distal Xq for the mutant gene in this 
      family.

TI  - MECP2 is highly mutated in X-linked mental retardation.
PG  - 941-6
AB  - Following the recent discovery that the methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MECP2) gene 
      located on Xq28 is involved in Rett syndrome (RTT), a wild spectrum of phenotypes, 
      including mental handicap, has been shown to be associated with mutations in MECP2. 
      These findings, with the compelling genetic evidence suggesting the presence in Xq28 
      of additional genes besides RabGDI1 and FMR2 involved in non-specific X-linked 
      mental retardation (MRX), prompted us to investigate MECP2 in MRX families. Two 
      novel mutations, not found in RTT, were identified. The first mutation, an E137G, 
      was identified in the MRX16 family, and the second, R167W, was identified in a new 
      mental retardation (MR) family shown to be linked to Xq28. In view of these data, we 
      screened MECP2 in a cohort of 185 patients found negative for the expansions across 
      the FRAXA CGG repeat and reported the identification of mutations in four sporadic 
      cases of MR. One of the mutations, A140V, which we found in two patients, has been 
      described previously, whereas the two others, P399L and R453Q, are novel mutations. 
      In addition to the results demonstrating the involvement of MECP2 in MRX, this study 
      shows that the frequency of mutations in MECP2 in the mentally retarded population 
      screened for the fragile X syndrome is comparable to the frequency of the CGG 
      expansions in FMR1. Therefore, implementation of systematic screening of MECP2 in MR 
      patients should result in significant progress in the field of molecular diagnosis 
      and genetic counseling of mental handicap.

TI  - X-linked mental retardation with thin habitus, osteoporosis, and kyphoscoliosis: 
      linkage to Xp21.3-p22.12.
PG  - 50-8
AB  - We reevaluated a family previously described as having nonspecific X-linked mental 
      retardation (XLMR) by Snyder and Robinson [1969: Clin Pediatr 8:669-674] (MIM 
      309583). Clinical and DNA studies were conducted on 17 relatives, including 6 males 
      with mild-to-moderate mental retardation, 3 carrier females, and 8 normal males. In 
      contrast to the normal appearance and minimal clinical findings reported 22 years 
      ago, affected males were found to have a characteristic set of clinical findings. 
      These developed gradually over the first 2 decades, and included thin body build 
      with diminished muscle mass, osteoporosis and kyphoscoliosis, slight facial 
      asymmetry with a prominent lower lip, nasal speech, high narrow or cleft plate, and 
      long great toes. Carrier females were clinically normal. Multipoint linkage analysis 
      indicated linkage to markers distal to the 3' end of DMD (DXS41 and DXS989), with a 
      maximal lod score of 4.7. On the basis of these findings, this entity is redefined 
      as XLMR syndrome.

TI  - A novel ribosomal S6-kinase (RSK4; RPS6KA6) is commonly deleted in patients with 
      complex X-linked mental retardation.
PG  - 332-43
AB  - Large deletions in Xq21 often are associated with contiguous gene syndromes 
      consisting of X-linked deafness type 3 (DFN3), mental retardation (MRX), and 
      choroideremia (CHM). The identification of deletions associated with classic CHM or 
      DFN3 facilitated the positional cloning of the underlying genes, REP-1 and POU3F4, 
      respectively, and enabled the positioning of the MRX gene in between these genes. 
      Here, we report the cloning and characterization of a novel gene, ribosomal 
      S6-kinase 4 (RSK4; HGMW-approved symbol RPS6KA6), which maps in the MRX critical 
      region. RSK4 is completely deleted in eight patients with the contiguous gene 
      syndrome including MRX, partially deleted in a patient with DFN3 and present in 
      patients with an Xq21 deletion and normal intellectual abilities. RSK4 is most 
      abundantly expressed in brain and kidney. The predicted protein of 746 amino acids 
      shows a high level of homology to three previously isolated members of the human RSK 
      family. RSK2 is involved in Coffin-Lowry syndrome and nonspecific MRX. The 
      localization of RSK4 in the interval that is commonly deleted in mentally retarded 
      males together with the high degree of amino acid identity with RSK2 suggests that 
      RSK4 plays a role in normal neuronal development. Further mutation analyses in males 
      with X-linked mental retardation must prove that RSK4 is indeed a novel MRX gene.

TI  - Chromosomal copy number changes in patients with non-syndromic X linked mental 
      retardation detected by array CGH.
PG  - 362-70
AB  - Several studies have shown that array based comparative genomic hybridisation (CGH) 
      is a powerful tool for the detection of copy number changes in the genome of 
      individuals with a congenital disorder. In this study, 40 patients with non-specific 
      X linked mental retardation were analysed with full coverage, X chromosomal, 
      bacterial artificial chromosome arrays. Copy number changes were validated by 
      multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification as a fast method to detect 
      duplications and deletions in patient and control DNA. This approach has the 
      capacity to detect copy number changes as small as 100 kb. We identified three 
      causative duplications: one family with a 7 Mb duplication in Xp22.2 and two 
      families with a 500 kb duplication in Xq28 encompassing the MECP2 gene. In addition, 
      we detected four regions with copy number changes that were frequently identified in 
      our group of patients and therefore most likely represent genomic polymorphisms. 
      These results confirm the power of array CGH as a diagnostic tool, but also 
      emphasise the necessity to perform proper validation experiments by an independent 
      technique.

      metabolism. The majority of the previous reports dealt with pediatric patients, in 
      contrast to the present study. A total of 180 institutionalized patients with a 
      severe mental handicap were investigated for urine and plasma uric acid and 
      creatinine. Patients with an increased urinary uric acid/creatinine ratio and/or 
      decreased creatinine were subjected to the analysis of guanidinoacetate (GAA). Four 
      patients (three related and one from an unrelated family) were identified with 
      GAMT-deficiency. A fifth patient had died before a biochemical diagnosis could be 
      made. They all had shown a normal psychomotor development for the first year of 
      life, after which they developed a profound mental retardation. Three out of four 
      had convulsions and all four totally lacked the development of speech. Their GAMT 
      activity in lymphoblasts was impaired and two novel mutations were identified: the 
      59 G > C and 506 G > A missense mutations. Urinary GAA was increased, but highly 
      variable 347-1,624 mmol/mol creat (Controls <150 mmol/mol creat). In plasma and CSF 
      the GAA levels were fairly constant at 17.3-27.0 mumol/L (Controls 1.33-3.33) and 
      11.0-12.4 mumol/L, respectively (Controls 0.068-0.114). GAMT deficiency in adults is 
      associated with severe mental retardation and absence or limited speech development. 
      Convulsions may be prominent. The nonspecific nature of the clinical findings as 
      well as the limited availability of GAA assays and/or in vivo magnetic resonance 
      spectroscopy of the brain may mean that many more patients remain undiagnosed in 
      institutions for persons with mental handicaps.

TI  - Oligophrenin-1 encodes a rhoGAP protein involved in X-linked mental retardation.
PG  - 923-6
AB  - Primary or nonspecific X-linked mental retardation (MRX) is a heterogeneous 
      condition in which affected patients do not have any distinctive clinical or 
      biochemical features in common apart from cognitive impairment. Although it is 
      present in approximately 0.15-0.3% of males, most of the genetic defects associated 
      with MRX, which may involve more than ten different genes, remain unknown. Here we 
      report the characterization of a new gene on the long arm of the X-chromosome 
      (position Xq12) and the identification in unrelated individuals of different 
      mutations that are predicted to cause a loss of function. This gene is highly 
      expressed in fetal brain and encodes a protein of relative molecular mass 91K, named 
      oligophrenin-1, which contains a domain typical of a Rho-GTPase-activating protein 
      (rhoGAP). By enhancing their GTPase activity, GAP proteins inactivate small Rho and 
      Ras proteins, so inactivation of rhoGAP proteins might cause constitutive activation 
      of their GTPase targets. Such activation is known to affect cell migration and 
      outgrowth of axons and dendrites in vivo. Our results demonstrate an association 
      between cognitive impairment and a defect in a signalling pathway that depends on a 
      Ras-like GTPase.

AB  - X-linked ichthyosis is a genetic disorder affecting the skin and caused by a deficit 
      in the steroid sulfatase enzyme (STS), often associated with a recurrent 
      microdeletion at Xp22.31. Most of the STS deleted patients have X-linked ichthyosis 
      as the only clinical feature and it is believed that patients with more complex 
      disorders including mental retardation could be present as a result of contiguous 
      gene deletion. In fact, VCX3A gene, a member of the VCX (variable charge, X 
      chromosome) gene family, was previously proposed as the candidate gene for X-linked 
      non-specific mental retardation in patients with X-linked ichthyosis. We report on a 
      boy with familial ichthyosis, dysmorphic features and moderate mental retardation 
      with approximately 2 Mb interstitial deletion on Xp22.3 involving VCX3A and STS 
      genes.

TI  - Localisation of the MRX3 gene for non-specific X linked mental retardation.
PG  - 372-7
AB  - A family is described with five affected males segregating a new gene for 
      non-specific X linked mental retardation (MRX). Linkage analysis localised the gene 
      at Xq28-qter. The maximum lod score was 2.89 with DXS52 (St14) at theta = 0.0. A 
      recombinant was observed with DXS304 (U6.2) defining the proximal limit to the 
      localisation. No evidence for linkage was determined using markers at several points 
      along the remainder of the X chromosome, including the regions known to contain MRX1 
      and MRX2. This delineates the third gene for non-specific X linked mental 
      retardation, MRX3.

AB  - Self-injurious behavior (SIB) is a major cause of difficulty for the developmentally 
      disabled person. Causes are varied, but medical, neurological, and psychiatric 
      disorders should be considered before nonspecific approaches to treatment are 
      chosen. A careful assessment should include a thorough medical and psychiatric 
      evaluation as well as laboratory and diagnostic studies. Various assessment 
      instruments are available to aid in the evaluation process and, to some extent, in 
      the evaluation of the effectiveness of treatment for SIB.

TI  - Prevalence of the fragile X syndrome in Yugoslav patients with non-specific mental 
      retardation.
PG  - 223-30
AB  - Mutations at two fragile sites, FRAXA and FRAXE, loci are caused by an expansion of 
      a CGG/GCC trinucleotide repeat and are characterized by mental retardation. Here we 
      report molecular screening survey of 97 unrelated individuals diagnosed with 
      non-specific mental retardation (MR), which produced positive test for FRAXA in two 
      boys and none positive for the FRAXE mutation. In addition, we studied allelic 
      frequency distribution for the FRAXA locus in this group of mentally retarded 
      patients, as well as in the 99 healthy subjects of Yugoslav population. The 
      distribution of FMR1 CGG repeat size in both groups was similar: the most common 
      allele contained 29 repeats (32.86% in the healthy population and 54.54% in MR 
      population), followed by the allele with 28 CGG repeats (21.43% in the healthy and 
      12.2% in MR population). Premutation alleles with more than 45 repeats were not 
      found in control nor in the MR group.

TI  - Mutations in GDI1 are responsible for X-linked non-specific mental retardation.
PG  - 134-9
AB  - Rab GDP-dissociation inhibitors (GDI) are evolutionarily conserved proteins that 
      play an essential role in the recycling of Rab GTPases required for vesicular 
      transport through the secretory pathway. We have found mutations in the GDI1 gene 
      (which encodes uGDI) in two families affected with X-linked non-specific mental 
      retardation. One of the mutations caused a non-conservative substitution (L92P) 
      which reduced binding and recycling of RAB3A, the second was a null mutation. Our 
      results show that both functional and developmental alterations in the neuron may 
      account for the severe impairment of learning abilities as a consequence of 
      mutations in GDI1, emphasizing its critical role in development of human 
      intellectual and learning abilities.

TI  - Activity-dependent regulation of genes implicated in X-linked non-specific mental 
      retardation.
PG  - 13-7
AB  - X-linked forms of non-specific mental retardation are complex disorders, for which 
      mutations in several genes have recently been identified. These include OPHN1, GDI1, 
      PAK3, IL1RAPL, TM4SF2, FMR2 and RSK2. To investigate the mechanisms through which 
      alterations of these gene products could result in cognitive impairment, we analyzed 
      their expression using quantitative PCR technique in two in vitro models of 
      activity-dependent gene regulation: kainate-induced seizures and long-term synaptic 
      potentiation (LTP). We found that the level of expression of four genes, PAK3, 
      IL1RAPL, RSK2 and TM4SF2, was significantly up-regulated following kainate 
      treatment. Furthermore we observed a significant increase in mRNA levels of PAK3 and 
      IL1RAPL following LTP induction. These results suggest a possible role for these 
      four genes in activity-dependent brain plasticity.

TI  - Psychopharmacotherapy in children and adults with intellectual disability.
PG  - 233-42
AB  - The prevalence of psychiatric disorders is increased in children and adults with 
      intellectual disability. Brain damage or dysfunction interact with social and family 
      factors to increase susceptibility to mental illness. Psychiatric disorders in the 
      context of genetic syndromes are commonly overlooked, and there is substantial 
      underdiagnosis of mental disorders because of the atypical and non-specific clinical 
      presentations, and the frequent assumption that psychiatric symptoms are an inherent 
      part of the underlying intellectual disability. There is a strong need for 
      evidence-based practice in the prescribing and monitoring of drugs in this 
      population, especially since many of the drugs are unlicensed for use in children. 
      There is an urgent need to understand and establish the pharmacokinetics, 
      pharmacodynamics, and side-effect profiles of psychotropic medication in this 
      population. Positive trends in pharmacotherapy include the use of atypical 
      antipsychotics instead of the classic antipsychotics, serotonin-specific reuptake 
      inhibitors (SSRIs) rather than tricyclic antidepressants, and newer antiepileptic 
      drugs. Another welcome trend is the use of SSRIs instead of antipsychotics in the 
      long-term management of challenging behaviour in this population.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: MED13L-related intellectual disability is characterized by moderate 
      intellectual disability (ID), speech impairment, and dysmorphic facial features. We 
      present 8 patients with MED13L-related intellectual disability and review the 
      literature for phenotypical and genetic aspects of previously described patients. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the search for genetic aberrations in individuals with ID, 
      two of the patients were identified by chromosomal microarray analysis, and five by 
      exome sequencing. One of the individuals, suspected of MED13L-related intellectual 
      disability, based on clinical features, was identified by Sanger sequencing. 
      RESULTS: All 8 individuals had de novo MED13L aberrations, including two intragenic 
      microdeletions, two frameshift, three nonsense variants, and one missense variant. 
      Phenotypically, they all had intellectual disability, speech and motor delay, and 
      features of the mouth (open mouth appearance, macroglossia, and/or macrostomia). Two 
      individuals were diagnosed with autism, and one had autistic features. One had 
      complex congenital heart defect, and one had persistent foramen ovale. The 
      literature was reviewed with respect to clinical and dysmorphic features, and 
      genetic aberrations. CONCLUSIONS: Even if most clinical features of MED13L-related 
      intellectual disability are rather non-specific, the syndrome may be suspected in 
      some individuals based on the association of developmental delay, speech impairment, 
      bulbous nasal tip, and macroglossia, macrostomia, or open mouth appearance.

TI  - Sarcolemmal indentation in cardiomyopathy with mental retardation and vacuolar 
      myopathy.
PG  - 149-55
AB  - Muscle biopsies from three patients with cardiomyopathy, mental retardation and 
      increased serum creatine kinase levels revealed scattered fibers with tiny 
      intracytoplasmic vacuoles containing basophilic and acid phosphatase-positive 
      material and slightly increased amounts of PAS-positive granules. These findings are 
      consistent with those seen in the so-called lysosomal glycogen storage disease with 
      normal acid maltase. In addition to the vacuoles, there were occasional folds or 
      indentations in the sarcolemma which were connected to the membrane enclosing the 
      vacuoles. These membranes were well demonstrated histochemically by the nonspecific 
      esterase and acetylcholinesterase stains. On electron microscopy, most of the 
      vacuoles were bounded by membranes with basal lamina. The vacuolar membrane stained 
      positively with antibodies raised to dystrophin, dystrophin-associated 
      glycoproteins, laminin and type 4 collagen, and it was identical to the sarcolemma 
      and its basal lamina. Therefore, the membrane abnormality which causes sarcolemmal 
      folding is probably critical to understanding the pathomechanism of this disease.

TI  - Clinical and behavioral characteristics in FG syndrome.
PG  - 470-5
AB  - FG syndrome is a rare X-linked recessive form of mental retardation, first described 
      by Opitz and Kaveggia in 1974. Based on over 50 reported cases, FG syndrome is 
      associated with agenesis of the corpus callosum, minor facial anomalies (high, broad 
      forehead with frontal cowlick, ocular hypertelorism, down-slanted palpebral 
      fissures, and small cupped auricles), relative macrocephaly, broad thumbs and 
      halluces, and prominent fetal fingertip pads. Affected individuals manifest neonatal 
      hypotonia and severe constipation, which usually resolves during mid-childhood. The 
      hypotonia with joint hyperlaxity evolves into spasticity with joint contractures in 
      later life. Affability, hyperactivity, and excessive talkativeness are noted 
      frequently in patients with FG syndrome. Recently, we described three additional 
      families (six additional patients) with FG syndrome who support the localization of 
      a gene for the FG syndrome in chromosome region Xq12-q21 [Graham JM Jr, Tackels D, 
      Dibbern K, Superneau D, Rodgers C, Corning K, Schwartz CE. 1998. Am J Med Genet 
      80:145-156.]. Using these same families and one additional sporadic case of FG 
      syndrome, we compared behavioral and personality characteristics of 6 FG boys with 
      other boys with syndromic and nonsyndromic mental retardation: eight with Down 
      syndrome, seven with Prader-Willi syndrome, eight with nonspecific mental 
      retardation, and 13 with Williams syndrome. Using the Vineland Adaptive Behavior 
      Scales, the Reiss Personality Profiles, and the Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist, 
      parents were asked to characterize the behavior and personality of their boys from 
      ages 4 to 10 years. When compared with Williams syndrome, the FG boys had fewer 
      internalizing behaviors and were significantly less anxious and withdrawn but had 
      similar socially oriented, attention-seeking behaviors. On the Reiss Profile, FG 
      boys were also quite similar to Williams syndrome boys. On the Vineland Scales, FG 
      boys demonstrated significant relative strengths in their socialization skills, 
      consistent with their personality, tending to confirm previous descriptions of their 
      personalities.

      neurodevelopmental genes in patients with developmental delay, mental retardation, 
      and/or autism spectrum disorders.
PG  - 2386-96
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.a.34177 [doi]
AB  - Recent studies suggest that copy number variations (CNVs) encompassing several genes 
      involved in neurodevelopmental pathways are associated with a variety of 
      neuropsychiatric phenotypes, including developmental delay (DD), mental retardation 
      (MR), and autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Here we present eight patients in a 
      cohort of approximately 1,200 patients referred for clinical array CGH testing for 
      various neurodevelopmental phenotypes,whowere identified to carry small (<1.0Mb with 
      the majority <500 kb) either total gene or intragenic deletions encompassing 
      critical synaptic and other neurodevelopmental genes. The presentations of these 
      patients included variable degrees of DD, speech problems, learning disabilities, 
      MR, autistic-like features, and mild non-specific dysmorphic features. These genes 
      belong to four functional categories, including neuronal transcription factor genes 
      (NFIA at 1p31.3, MEF2C at 5q14.3, andCAMAT1at 1p36.23p36.31), neuron-specific 
      splicing factor genes (RBFOX1 at 16p13.2p13.3), genes involved in synapse formation 
      and maintenance (CNTNAP2 at 7q35 and LRFN5 at 14q21.2), and genes involved in 
      neurotransmission (CHRNA7 at 15q13.3 and IL1RAPL1 at Xp21.2p21.3). Our report 
      expands the list of neurodevelopmental genes deleted in various neurobehavioral 
      phenotypes, expands the phenotypes caused by haploinsufficiency of previously 
      reported critical neurodevelopmental genes, and elucidates the clinical relevance 
      and need for careful clinical interpretation of some small CNVs<500 kb. This report 
      also suggests that small clinically relevant deletions encompassing critical 
      synaptic and other neurodevelopmental genes can present clinically with various 
      neurobehavioral phenotypes, which implies the existence of overlapping neuronal 
      pathways in the pathogenesis of these phenotypes.

TI  - Inherited microdeletion in Xp21.3-22.1 involved in non-specific mental retardation.
PG  - 136-41
AB  - X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) is a genetically and clinically heterogeneous 
      common disorder. A cumulative frequency of about 1/600 male births was estimated by 
      different authors, including the fragile X syndrome, which affects 1/4000 males. 
      Given this very high cumulative frequency, identification of genes and molecular 
      mechanisms involved in other XLMRs, represents a challenging task of considerable 
      medical importance. In this report we describe clinical and molecular investigations 
      in the family of a mentally retarded boy for whom a microdeletion in Xp21.3-22.1 was 
      detected within the frame of a previously reported systematic search for deletion 
      using STS-PCR screening. Thorough clinical investigation of the sibling showed that 
      two affected brothers exhibit a moderate non-specific mental retardation without any 
      additional neurological impairment, statural growth deficiency or characteristic 
      dysmorphy. Molecular analysis revealed that the microdeletion observed in this 
      family is an inherited defect which cosegregates with mental retardation as an 
      X-linked recessive condition, since both non-deleted boys and transmitting mother 
      are normal. These results and the inherited microdeletion detected within the same 
      region associated with non-specific MR, reported by Raeymaekers et al., suggest that 
      Xp21.3 MR locus is prone to deletions. Therefore, search for microdeletions in the 
      eight families assigned by linkage analysis to this region might allow a better 
      definition of the critical region and an identification of the gene involved in this 
      X-linked mental retardation.

TI  - Physical and transcript map of a 2-Mb region in Xp22.1 containing candidate genes 
      for X-linked mental retardation and short stature.
PG  - 274-7
AB  - Genetic loci for several diseases, including X-linked nonspecific mental retardation 
      and short stature, have been mapped to Xp22.1. In spite of the recent publications 
      of two draft sequences for the human genome, this region seems to be largely 
      unmapped and unsequenced. Here we report an integrated physical and transcript map 
      of approximately 2-Mb from DXS8004 to DXS365. Using sequence tagged site 
      (STS)-content mapping and chromosome walking, we assembled a genomic clone contig of 
      54 BACs and one cosmid with an estimated 4.5-fold coverage of this region. The 
      minimum tiling path consists of 23 BACs and one cosmid. Onto this contig, we mapped 
      30 new STSs derived from the unique end-sequences of the BACs, three expressed 
      sequence tags, five genes, and seven CpG islands. This integrated map provides a 
      unique resource for the positional cloning of candidate disease genes mapping to 
      Xp22.1 and is therefore of value for the completion of the genomic sequence of this 
      region.

TI  - Cloning and characterization of DXS6673E, a candidate gene for X-linked mental 
      retardation in Xq13.1.
PG  - 887-97
AB  - In several families with non-specific X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) linkage 
      analyses have assigned the underlying gene defect to the pericentromeric region of 
      the X chromosome, but none of these genes have been isolated so far. Here, we report 
      on the cloning and characterization of a novel gene, DXS6673E, that maps to Xq13.1, 
      is subject to X-inactivation and is disrupted in the 5' untranslated region by a 
      balanced X;13 translocation in a mentally retarded female. The DXS6673E gene is 
      highly conserved among vertebrates and its expression is most abundant in brain. It 
      encodes a hydrophilic protein of 1358 amino acids (aa) that does not show sequence 
      homology to other known proteins. A segment of this protein consisting of neutral 
      and hydrophobic aa with a proline residue in every second position may represent a 
      transmembrane domain. Almost complete sequence identity was found between the 3' end 
      of the DXS6673E gene and two expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and between the 5' end 
      of the DXS6673E gene and a third EST. Moreover, weaker sequence similarity was 
      observed between coding regions and two other ESTs.

TI  - Localisation of a gene for non-specific X linked mental retardation (MRX46) to 
      Xq25-q26.
PG  - 801-5
AB  - We report linkage data on a new large family with non-specific X linked mental 
      retardation (MRX), using 24 polymorphic markers covering the entire X chromosome. We 
      could assign the underlying disease gene, denoted MRX46, to the Xq25-q26 region. 
      MRX46 is tightly linked to the markers DXS8072, HPRT, and DXS294 with a maximum lod 
      score of 5.12 at theta=0. Recombination events were observed with DXS425 in Xq25 and 
      DXS984 at the Xq26-Xq27 boundary, which localises MRX46 to a 20.9 cM (12 Mb) 
      interval. Several X linked mental retardation syndromes have been mapped to the same 
      region of the X chromosome. In addition, the localisation of two MRX genes, MRX27 
      and MRX35, partially overlaps with the linkage interval obtained for MRX46. Although 
      an extension of the linkage analysis for MRX35 showed only a minimal overlap with 
      MRX46, it cannot be excluded that the same gene is involved in several of these MRX 
      disorders. On the other hand, given the considerable genetic heterogeneity in MRX, 
      one should be extremely cautious in using interfamilial linkage data to narrow down 
      the localisation of MRX genes. Therefore, unless the underlying gene(s) is 
      characterised by the analysis of candidate genes, MRX46 can be considered a new 
      independent MRX locus.

TI  - A marker X chromosome associated with nonspecific male mental retardation. The first 
      South African cases.
PG  - 807-11
AB  - This report describes the first cases of X-linked mental retardation with a marker X 
      chromosome seen in South Africa, and forms part of an ongoing study. The marker was 
      found in 11 affected males and 1 carrier female in 4 families investigated. The 
      demonstration of the marker X chromosome characterized by a fragile site at the long 
      arm (fra(X) (q27) in association with nonspecific X-linked mental retardation 
      heralds a new era in cytogenetics. The attention of human geneticists everywhere is 
      focused on various aspects of this fascinating phenomenon. It has now become 
      possible to diagnose an apparently common familial cytogenetic condition with a high 
      risk of recurrence and to identify female carriers; perhaps in time we will be able 
      to provide prenatal diagnosis. Because of the familial involvement through X-linked 
      inheritance the syndrome is believed to be more common than trisomy 21. The nature 
      of the association of mental retardation with the marker X chromosome is unknown, 
      but it could be related to close linkage with abnormal gene(s) or due to faulty 
      transcription of the genes beyond the fragile site.

TI  - Second-order belief attribution in Williams syndrome: intact or impaired?
PG  - 523-32
AB  - Second-order mental state attribution in a group of children with Williams syndrome 
      was investigated. The children were compared to age, IQ, and language-matched groups 
      of children with Prader-Willi syndrome or nonspecific mental retardation. 
      Participants were given two trials of a second-order reasoning task. No significant 
      differences between the Williams syndrome and Prader-Willi or mentally retarded 
      groups on any of the test questions were found. Results contrast with the view that 
      individuals with Williams syndrome have an intact theory of mind and suggest that in 
      their attributions of second-order mental states, children with Williams syndrome 
      perform no better than do other groups of children with mental retardation.

TI  - A new member of the IL-1 receptor family highly expressed in hippocampus and 
      involved in X-linked mental retardation.
PG  - 25-31
AB  - We demonstrate here the importance of interleukin signalling pathways in cognitive 
      function and the normal physiology of the CNS. Thorough investigation of an MRX 
      critical region in Xp22.1-21.3 enabled us to identify a new gene expressed in brain 
      that is responsible for a non-specific form of X-linked mental retardation. This 
      gene encodes a 696 amino acid protein that has homology to IL-1 receptor accessory 
      proteins. Non-overlapping deletions and a nonsense mutation in this gene were 
      identified in patients with cognitive impairment only. Its high level of expression 
      in post-natal brain structures involved in the hippocampal memory system suggests a 
      specialized role for this new gene in the physiological processes underlying memory 
      and learning abilities.

PG  - 644-655
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.c.31839 [doi]
AB  - Mosaic genetic mutations may be somatic, germline, or "gonosomal" and have the 
      potential to cause genetic syndromes, disorders, or malformations. Mutations can 
      occur at any point in embryonic development and the timing determines the extent of 
      distribution of the mutation throughout the body and different tissue types. The eye 
      and visual pathway offer a unique opportunity to study somatic and gonosomal mosaic 
      mutations as the eye consists of tissues derived from all three germ layers allowing 
      disease pathology to be assessed with noninvasive imaging. In this review, we 
      describe systemic and ocular manifestations in a child with mosaic Coffin-Siris 
      syndrome. The patient presented with a significant medical history of accommodative 
      esotropia and hyperopia, macrocephaly, polydactyly, global developmental delay, 
      hypotonia, ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) obstruction, and brain MRI abnormalities. 
      The ophthalmic findings in this patient were nonspecific, however, they are 
      consistent with ocular manifestations reported in other patients with Coffin-Siris 
      syndrome. We also review ophthalmic findings of select mosaic chromosomal and 
      single-gene disorders. Ophthalmic assessment alongside clinical genetic testing may 
      play an important role in diagnosis of genetic syndromes as well as understanding 
      disease pathology, particularly when mosaicism plays a role.

TI  - ADAT3-related intellectual disability: Further delineation of the phenotype.
PG  - 1142-7
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.a.37578 [doi]
AB  - ADAT3-related intellectual disability has been recently described in 24 individuals 
      from eight Saudi families who had cognitive impairment and strabismus. Other common 
      features included growth failure, microcephaly, tone abnormalities, epilepsy, and 
      nonspecific brain abnormalities. A single homozygous founder mutation 
      (c.382G>A:p.(V128M)) in the ADAT3 gene, which encodes a protein that functions in 
      tRNA editing, was identified in all affected individuals. In this report, we present 
      additional 15 individuals from 11 families (10 Saudis and 1 Emirati) who are 
      homozygous for the same founder mutation. In addition to the universal findings of 
      intellectual disability and strabismus, the majority exhibited microcephaly and 
      growth failure. Additional features not reported in the original cohort include 
      dysmorphic facial features (prominent forehead, up-slanted palpebral fissures, 
      epicanthus, and depressed nasal bridge), behavioral problems (hyperactivity and 
      aggressiveness), recurrent otitis media, and growth hormone deficiency. 
      ADAT3-related intellectual disability is an important recognizable cause of 
      intellectual disability in Arabia.

AB  - The present study is an in-depth examination of receptive vocabulary in individuals 
      with Down syndrome (DS) in comparison to control groups of individuals of similar 
      nonverbal ability with typical development (TD) and non-specific etiology 
      intellectual disability (ID). Verb knowledge was of particular interest, as it is 
      known to be a predictor of later syntactic development. Fifty participants with DS, 
      aged 10-21 years, 29 participants with ID, 10-21 years, and 29 participants with TD, 
      4-9 years, completed measures of receptive vocabulary (PPVT-4), nonverbal ability 
      (Leiter-R), and phonological memory (Nonword Repetition subtest of the CTOPP). 
      Groups were compared on percentage correct of noun, verb and attribute items on the 
      PPVT-4. Results revealed that on verb items, the participants with ID performed 
      significantly better than both participants with DS and TD, even when overall 
      receptive vocabulary ability and phonological memory were held constant. Groups with 
      DS and TD showed the same pattern of lexical knowledge, performing better on nouns 
      than both verbs and attributes. In contrast, the group with ID performed similarly 
      on nouns and verbs, but worse on attributes.

TI  - Regional localisation of two non-specific X-linked mental retardation genes (MRX30 
      and MRX31).
PG  - 113-20
AB  - Two genes responsible for X-linked mental retardation have been localised by linkage 
      analysis. MRX30 maps to a 28 cM region flanked by the loci DXS990 (Xq21.3) and 
      DXS424 (Xq24). A significant multipoint lod score of 2.78 was detected between the 
      loci DXS1120 and DXS456. MRX31 maps to a 12 cM region that spans the centromere from 
      DXS1126 (Xp11.23) to DXS1124 (Xq13.3). Significant two-point lod scores, at a 
      recombination fraction of zero, were obtained with the loci DXS991 (Zmax = 2.06), AR 
      (Zmax = 3.44), PGK1P1 (Zmax = 2.06) and DXS453 (Zmax = 3.31). The MRX30 localisation 
      overlaps that of MRX8, 13, 20 and 26 and defines the position of a new MRX gene on 
      the basis of a set of non-overlapping regional localisations. The MRX31 localisation 
      overlaps the localisations of many of the pericentromeric MRX loci (MRX 1, 4, 5, 7, 
      8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 20, 22 and 26). There are now at least 8 distinct loci 
      associated with non-specific mental retardation on the X chromosome defined, in 
      order from pter to qter, by localisation for MRX24, MRX2, MRX10, MRX1, MRX30, MRX27, 
      FRAXE and MRX3.

TI  - Dermatoglyphic and palmar-crease alterations as indicators of early intra-uterine 
      insult in mental retardation.
PG  - 53-9
AB  - A comparative study of unusual dermatoglyphic and palmar patterns revealed 
      significant differences between the frequencies of certain patterns among 200 
      congenitally affected mentally retarded children and 500 normal controls. A scoring 
      method demonstrating the significance of eight unusual patterns as non-specific 
      indicators of early intra-uterine fetal insult was devised. 10 per cent of the 
      children previously classified as idiopathically mentally retarded were shown to 
      have been exposed to early intra-uterine insult. Dermatoglyphic and palmar-crease 
      analysis should be included as a routine investigation for children with mental 
      retardation of unknown cause.

TI  - MECP2 mutation in male patients with non-specific X-linked mental retardation.
PG  - 285-8
AB  - In contrast to the preponderance of affected males in families with X-linked mental 
      retardation, Rett syndrome (RTT) is a neurological disorder occurring almost 
      exclusively in females. The near complete absence of affected males in RTT families 
      has been explained by the lethal effect of an X-linked gene mutation in hemizygous 
      affected males. We report here on a novel mutation (A140V) in the MECP2 gene 
      detected in one female with mild mental retardation. In a family study, the A140V 
      mutation was found to segregate in the affected daughter and in four adult sons with 
      severe mental retardation. These results indicate that MECP2 mutations are not 
      necessarily lethal in males and that they can be causative of non-specific X-linked 
      mental retardation.

TI  - Mild phenotypic manifestations of terminal deletion of the long arm of chromosome 4: 
      clinical description of a new patient.
PG  - 116-9
AB  - We present clinical and developmental data on a patient with a de novo terminal 
      deletion of the long arm of chromosome 4. Cytogenetic studies after G-banding 
      revealed the karyotype 46,XY,del(4)(q34). The 4-year-old male showed mild facial 
      dysmorphism, moderate mental retardation with speech retardation, and marked 
      deficits in gross motor skills. Our patient is the second with this deletion 
      described in the literature. In both patients the phenotype was characterized by 
      mild to moderate mental retardation, abnormalities of the pinnae, and nonspecific 
      facial dysmorphism. The mild phenotype might explain why only two patients with this 
      deletion have been described so far.

PG  - 29-32
AB  - A ring chromosome 9 is reported in a 12-year-old, moderately mentally retarded boy. 
      As in other ring chromosome 9 patients, the clinical stigmata are nonspecific and 
      their expressivity is mild. The finding of two normal cells of a total of 121 cells 
      examined favors the hypothesis of a postzygotic, mitotic origin of the ring 
      chromosome formation.

TI  - Determination of the gene structure of human oligophrenin-1 and identification of 
      three novel polymorphisms by screening of DNA from 164 patients with non-specific 
      X-linked mental retardation.
PG  - 5-9
AB  - We have recently shown that mutations in oligophrenin-1 (OPHN1) are responsible for 
      non-specific X-linked mental retardation (MRX). The structure of the gene encoding 
      the OPHN1 protein was determined by isolation of genomic DNA clones from the human 
      cosmid library. Genomic fragments containing exons were sequenced, and the sequences 
      of the exons and flanking introns were defined. Knowledge of the genomic structure 
      of the OPHN1 gene, which spans at least 500 kb and consists of 25 exons, will 
      facilitate the search for additional mutations in OPHN1. OPHN1 was screened for 
      mutations in 164 subjects with non-specific mental retardation. Three nucleotide 
      substitutions were identified, one of which was a silent mutation in the codon 
      threonine 301 at position 903 (G-->C). The other substitutions were located in exon 
      2, a G-->A substitution at position 133 (A45T), and in exon 10, a C-->T substitution 
      at position 902 (T301M), but these are common polymorphisms rather than 
      disease-causing mutations.

TI  - A clinical approach to the pharmacotherapy of aggression in children and 
      adolescents.
PG  - 290-307
AB  - Overt aggression in its various forms is the most prevalent symptom presenting to 
      pediatric mental health providers, regardless of setting. It is a behavior with a 
      heterogeneous etiology and requires a comprehensive approach to evaluation and 
      treatment. Evaluation of the aggressive child must assess medical, neurologic, 
      psychiatric, psychosocial, familial, and/or educational contributions to behavioral 
      dyscontrol. Multimodal treatment is generally required. At present, there is no 
      single medication to recommend for the treatment of aggressive behavior. Multiple 
      medications have clinically been used in a nonspecific fashion to target excessive 
      childhood aggression. Although successful for some, this approach increases risk for 
      ineffective interventions accompanied by side effects. Until a scientific 
      understanding of the developmental neurobiology of aggression leads to more specific 
      treatment, this review suggests the use of a diagnostic-based approach to the 
      pharmacology of aggression (FIG. 1). Descriptive diagnostic techniques should be 
      used to define the presence of any primary or comorbid psychiatric disorder that 
      presents with aggression as an associated symptom. Treating aggression in the 
      context of these psychiatric syndromes appears to be the most direct approach. 
      Aggression occurring in the context of a medication-responsive psychiatric diagnosis 
      appears most sensitive to pharmacologic intervention. Presently, evidence for 
      efficacy is strongest for aggression in the context of ADHD, psychotic disorder, 
      adolescent-onset bipolar disorder, and ictal aggression It remains less clear that 
      medication can help aggression when it occurs independently of a pharmacologically 
      treatable comorbid psychiatric disorder. Aggression may respond to a target symptom 
      approach where discrete behavioral symptoms that contribute to aggression, such as 
      irritability, explosiveness, fear, or impulsivity, may be modified by medication 
      intervention (FIG. 1). When treatment is approached in this fashion, it is standard 
      practice to use the least toxic and safest intervention first. Behavioral treatment 
      based on contingency management principles could be initially recommended. 
      Medication trials should first use medications that have demonstrated empiric 
      efficacy in reducing aggression (TABLE 1) and that have a favorable safety profile. 
      Neuroleptics to treat aggression in nonpsychotic psychiatrically referred youth 
      should be kept to a minimum, secondary to their significant adverse risk profile. 
      Alternative medications, such as selective serotonin reuptake-inhibiting 
      antidepressants, buspirone, lithium, anticonvulsants, opiate blocking agents, 
      propranolol, nadolol, and clonidine, deserve more clinical research in pediatric 
      aggression. These medications may offer effective and less toxic alternatives in the 
      pharmacologic treatment of inappropriate excessive childhood aggression.

TI  - Impairment of cerebello-thalamo-frontal pathway in Rab-GDI mutated patients with 
      pure mental deficiency.
PG  - 6-13
LID - 10.1016/j.ejmg.2008.09.003 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rab-GDI mutations are responsible for "pure" mental deficiency, without 
      any specific clinical features or brain malformation. Therefore, screening for 
      mutations in mentally retarded patients is not available on a routine basis. 
      Moreover, neuronal networks involved in mental deficiency still remain largely 
      unknown. METHODS: We performed a fine neuropsychological and imaging study in five 
      patients from two unrelated families, affected with mental deficiency due to a 
      mutation in the Rab-GDI gene. High resolution 3D brain MRI of the five mentally 
      retarded adult males (mean age 33 years) were compared to MRI of 14 healthy males 
      (mean age 35 years) using a Voxel-Based Morphometric analysis (VBM). RESULTS: All 
      patients had isolated moderate mental retardation (WAIS-III IQ range, 41-50; mean 
      45) without specific morphological or behavioural features. No obvious brain 
      abnormality was observed on visual inspection of individual scans. Using VBM 
      analysis, Rab-GDI mutated patients' MRIs exhibited significant brain changes 
      compared to normal subjects (p<0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons): increased 
      grey matter density in left cerebellum and in left angular gyrus, decreased grey 
      matter volume in thalami, decreased white matter density in prefrontal lobes, right 
      fusiform occipito-temporal gyrus, and decreased white matter volume in cerebellar 
      peduncles. CONCLUSIONS: These morphological changes observed in Rab-GDI mutated 
      patients, mainly localized in the cerebello-thalamo-prefrontal pathway, are 
      consistent with the hypothesis that the cerebellum is one of the critical components 
      of a global learning network. Our results open new avenues in the diagnosis of 
      non-specific mental deficiency using gene-specific "brain maps" as endophenotypes.

TI  - A new X linked recessive syndrome of mental retardation and mild dysmorphism maps to 
      Xq28.
PG  - 529-34
AB  - Efforts to understand the genetic basis of mental retardation are greatly assisted 
      by the identification of families with multiple relatives with mental retardation 
      that clinical geneticists encounter in the routine practice of their profession. 
      Here we describe a linkage study of a four generation family in which X linked 
      recessive mental retardation (XLMR) is associated with minor dysmorphism and 
      premature death of the affected males. Microsatellite based polymorphic loci evenly 
      spaced over the entire X chromosome were used initially to detect linkage to Xq28. 
      Further analysis identified a haplotype of Xq28 markers bounded proximally by locus 
      DXS1113 and distally by DXS1108 that cosegregated with XLMR in this family. Two 
      point lod scores > 3.0 provided strong evidence that the gene locus responsible for 
      XLMR in this family is within this 7 Mb region of Xq28. The minor anomalies noted in 
      some affected males were not distinctive enough to suggest a unique syndrome. None 
      of our patients had features of the Waisman-Laxova syndrome or the PPM-X syndrome. 
      The possibility of allelism with any of the five other non-specific XLMR syndromes 
      (MRX3, MRX16, MRX25, MRX28, and MRX41) mapped to Xq28 could not be excluded. While 
      the recognition of a gene responsible for this disorder needs much additional work, 
      multiple female relatives at risk in this family benefit immediately from knowing 
      their genotype and heterozygotes will have the opportunity to undergo prenatal 
      diagnosis.

TI  - X-linked mental retardation: evidence for a recent mutation in a five-generation 
      family (MRX65) linked to the pericentromeric region.
PG  - 305-8
AB  - We report linkage analysis in a new family with nonspecific X-linked mental 
      retardation, using 27 polymorphic markers covering the entire X-chromosome. We could 
      assign the underlying disease gene, denoted MRX65, to the pericentromeric region, 
      with flanking markers DXS573 in Xp11.3 and DXS990 in Xq21.33. A maximum LOD score of 
      3.64 was found at markers ALAS2 (Xp11.22) and DXS453 (Xq12) at straight theta = 0. 
      Twenty-five of the 58 reported MRX families are linked to a region that is partially 
      overlapping with the region reported here. Extension of the pedigree showed a number 
      of unaffected distant relatives with haplotypes corresponding to the disease locus. 
      Apparently, a new mutation in a female is causative for the disease in the family 
      reported here. Furthermore, we show the importance of combining clinical, 
      cytogenetic, and molecular studies since one of the family members, expected to be 
      affected by the same genetic defect, has a 48,XXXY karyotype.

TI  - Loss of the 3p25.3 band is critical in the manifestation of del(3p) syndrome: 
      karyotype-phenotype correlation in cases with deficiency of the distal portion of 
      the short arm of chromosome 3.
PG  - 269-73
AB  - Two patients with monosomy for the distal portion of the short arm of chromosome 3 
      are described. Chromosome analysis on prometaphase cells demonstrated a karyotype of 
      46,XX,del(3) (p25.3) in one patient and 46,XX,r(3)(p26.1q29) in the other. The 
      former patient showed characteristic clinical manifestations of the 3p- syndrome, 
      including growth failure, mental retardation, microcephaly with a flat occiput, 
      triangular face, synophrys, blepharoptosis, hypertelorism, broad and flat nose, long 
      philtrum, down-turned mouth, micrognathia, apparently lowset and malformed ears, 
      fingers abnormalities, and deafness. The latter patient had a nonspecific phenotype 
      with mental retardation, growth failure and microcephaly. Karyotype-phenotype 
      comparisons in the present cases and 16 previously reported cases with deficiency of 
      the distal portion of 3p suggests that deficiency of the 3p25.3 band is critical to 
      produce the main clinical manifestations of the del(3p) syndrome.

TI  - Familial X-linked mental retardation with an X chromosome abnormality.
PG  - 46-50
AB  - An X-linked pattern of transmission observed in four families with familial mental 
      retardation in several generations was associated with a probable secondary 
      constriction at the distal end of the q arms of the X chromosome. Twenty retarded 
      males and no retarded females were observed. All available live retarded males and 
      most of their normal mothers were found to have the abnormal X chromosome. The 
      marker chromosome was shown to be the X chromosome in each case by Giemsa banding. 
      In affected male and female carriers the marker chromosome varied in appearance and 
      was not present in all metaphases. The significance of this study in relation to 
      previously reported pedigrees showing non-specific X-linked mental retardation is 
      discussed.

TI  - Phenotype-genotype characterization of alpha-thalassemia mental retardation syndrome 
      due to isolated monosomy of 16p13.3.
PG  - 225-32
AB  - An 8-year-old Caucasian girl presented with mild dysmorphic features and 
      intellectual disability (ID) affecting multiple spheres. Dysmorphisms included a 
      high forehead with up-slanting palpebral fissures, prominent nasal root and bridge, 
      flattened maxilla, high-arched palate, and anterior frenulum. Structural brain 
      anomalies included reduced periventricular white matter volume and thin corpus 
      callosum. The presence of HbH bodies and her clinical presentation raised suspicion 
      for autosomal alpha-thalassemia mental retardation syndrome (ATR-16). Whole-genome 
      array analysis at 1 Mb resolution was performed, which revealed a sub-microscopic 
      loss of 16p involving clones RP11-344L6 at 0.1 Mb, RP1-121I4 at 0.2 Mb and 
      RP11-334D3 at 1 Mb. FISH confirmed deletion (del) of the terminal clone (RP1-121I4) 
      on 16pter, which was de novo in origin. The more proximal clone RP11-334D3 (at 1 Mb) 
      showed diminished FISH signal intensity on one of the homologues, suggesting that 
      one breakpoint occurred within this clone. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) confirmed a de 
      novo deletion encompassing SOX8 (at 0.97 Mb). ATR-16 is characterized by ID with 
      mild, nonspecific dysmorphic features, and is associated with terminal del16p (MIM 
      No. 141750). Cases of isolated monosomy for 16p are rarely described; such 
      descriptions help to delineate the syndrome in the absence of confounding karyotypic 
      anomalies. We describe detailed molecular cytogenetic and clinical findings relating 
      to a subject with ATR-16.

PG  - 32-43
LID - 10.1352/0895-8017(2008)113[32:ECICWD]2.0.CO;2 [doi]
AB  - Although often described as temperamentally "easy" and sociable, children with Down 
      syndrome also exhibit behavior problems. Affective development is important for 
      social and behavioral competence. We examined negative affective expressions and a 
      range of emotion regulation/coping strategies during a frustrating task in a sample 
      of children with Down syndrome, nonspecific mental retardation, and typical 
      development. Results revealed that children with Down syndrome displayed 
      significantly more frustration and more orienting to the experimenter without asking 
      for help. Typical children used more goal-directed strategies, including 
      assistance-seeking and cognitive self-soothing. Findings suggest that children with 
      Down syndrome may use a limited repertoire of strategies for coping with 
      frustration. Suggestions for future intervention studies are provided.

TI  - Rethinking the fate of males with mutations in the gene that causes Rett syndrome.
PG  - S144-6
AB  - Rett syndrome (RTT) is usually described as an X-linked dominant disorder that is 
      lethal prenatally to males. While this hypothesis stemmed from the nearly exclusive 
      recognition of the classical features in females and the scarcity of similarly 
      affected or severely affected brothers of girls manifesting the classic phenotype, 
      there are actually no pedigree data to support it. The identification of 
      methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 gene (MECP2) as the causative gene for most cases of 
      RTT allows us to examine the fate of males with a mutation in the gene. Although the 
      number of cases is small, mutations in MECP2 that lead to the classical phenotype in 
      females do not appear to result in prenatal lethality of affected hemizygous males. 
      It is likely that sporadic cases are not ascertained because of the relative 
      non-specific congenital onset encephalopathy. Males who have MECP2 mutations and 
      Klinefelter syndrome or who are mosaic for the mutation are more likely to present 
      with a RTT-like phenotype.

TI  - Non-specific X-linked mental retardation: linkage analysis in MRX2 and MRX4 families 
      revisited.
PG  - 569-74
AB  - We have previously reported linkage analysis in 3 families with non-specific 
      X-linked mental retardation (XLMR). This used RFLPs and was limited by the 
      relatively low informativeness and density of markers available. We have performed a 
      new linkage analysis using microsatellites (including new Genethon markers) in the 
      two most informative families. In the MRX2 family, a lod score of 2.61 at theta = 
      0.05 had previously been obtained with DXS85 in Xp22.2. We now report a tighter 
      linkage with AFM 135xe7 (DXS989, z = 4.62 at theta = 0.00) and established the order 
      DXS85-DXS207-DXS999 (AFM234 y12)-MRX2, DXS365, DXS1052 (AFM 163yh2), DXS989-DXS1065 
      (AFM224zf2), DMD 3'. The localization of MRX2 in Xp22.2-p22.1 is thus clearly 
      different from the more distal MRX gene defined by patients with contiguous gene 
      syndromes. In the MRX4 family, a maximum lod score of 2.53 at theta = 0.00 had been 
      obtained with DXS159 in Xq13. Our present study did not show recombination from 
      ALAS2 in Xp11.21 to DXS441 in Xq13.3 (z = 3.38 at theta = 0.00 for the latter 
      marker) and the closest flanking markers are DXS255 in Xp11.22 and DXYS1 in Xq21.3. 
      Reduced recombination around the centromere prevents precise mapping. The 
      localisation of MRX4 overlaps with that of several other MRX families.

PG  - 2059-2069
LID - 10.1038/s41436-019-0473-6 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the effect of different DEAF1 variants on the phenotype of 
      patients with autosomal dominant and recessive inheritance patterns and on DEAF1 
      activity in vitro. METHODS: We assembled a cohort of 23 patients with de novo and 
      biallelic DEAF1 variants, described the genotype-phenotype correlation, and 
      investigated the differential effect of de novo and recessive variants on 
      transcription assays using DEAF1 and Eif4g3 promoter luciferase constructs. RESULTS: 
      The proportion of the most prevalent phenotypic features, including intellectual 
      disability, speech delay, motor delay, autism, sleep disturbances, and a high pain 
      threshold, were not significantly different in patients with biallelic and 
      pathogenic de novo DEAF1 variants. However, microcephaly was exclusively observed in 
      patients with recessive variants (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: We propose that different 
      variants in the DEAF1 gene result in a phenotypic spectrum centered around 
      neurodevelopmental delay. While a pathogenic de novo dominant variant would also 
      incapacitate the product of the wild-type allele and result in a dominant-negative 
      effect, a combination of two recessive variants would result in a partial loss of 
      function. Because the clinical picture can be nonspecific, detailed phenotype 
      information, segregation, and functional analysis are fundamental to determine the 
      pathogenicity of novel variants and to improve the care of these patients.

TI  - Localization of non-specific X-linked mental retardation genes.
PG  - 392-401
AB  - Gene localization was determined by linkage analysis in 5 families with non-specific 
      X-linked mental retardation (MRX) and were MRX1, Xp11.4-q21.31; MRX10, Xp21.3-p11.4; 
      MRX11, Xp21.3-p11.22; MRX12, Xp21.3-q21.1; and MRX13, Xp22.3-q21.22. Four of these 
      localizations cross the dystrophin brain promoter, a candidate locus for MRX. None 
      of the affected individuals who were tested showed variation suggestive of a 
      deletion. No consistent clinical features were observed between or within 4 of the 5 
      families. In MRX12, prematurity or low birth weight, hypotelorism and short stature 
      were seen in several affected males. Heterozygote manifestations occurred in 3 
      families. There was no evidence to suggest involvement of the same gene in more than 
      one family, nor to clinically separate these families into distinct genetic 
      entities. Non-overlapping localizations for MRX1 and MRX10 demonstrate the existence 
      of at least 2 separate loci among these 5 families.

TI  - Androgen insensitivity with mental retardation: a contiguous gene syndrome?
PG  - 158-60
AB  - We present data to suggest the existence of a mental retardation (MR) locus at 
      Xq11.2-q12 between DXS1 and DXS905, identified in two subjects with complete 
      androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS) and MR. Androgen insensitivity syndrome is a 
      disorder of male sexual differentiation caused by a defect in the androgen receptor 
      (AR) gene (Xq11-q12). Two subjects with CAIS resulting from a complete deletion of 
      the AR gene have previously been reported, one of whom also has MR. We have 
      identified another mentally retarded person with a complete deletion of the AR gene. 
      The deletion in the two patients with CAIS and MR extends past the AR gene and 
      includes several marker loci both proximal and distal to the AR gene, the limits of 
      the deletions being DXS1 and DXS905. The deletions in the CAIS patients who do not 
      have MR do not include any of the markers outside the AR gene itself. These data 
      suggest that located close to the AR gene is a gene which is implicated in 
      non-specific MR.

TI  - Transmitted cytogenetic abnormalities in patients with mental retardation: 
      pathogenic or normal variants?
PG  - 243-55
AB  - Knowing the origin of cytogenetic abnormalities detected in individuals with mental 
      retardation and dysmorphic features is essential to genetic counselling of affected 
      families. To illustrate this, we report on six families with transmitted cytogenetic 
      abnormalities and discuss the genotype-phenotype correlations, including the 
      possibility of the abnormalities being normal genomic variants. The abnormalities 
      were detected using metaphase HR-CGH; their size was estimated to range from 1.6 to 
      7.5 Mb using tiling path array-CGH and real-time PCR. The abnormalities were 
      transmitted through two to four generations and included interstitial deletions of 
      1p31.3-p32.1, 2q13, 10q11.21-q11.23, and 13q31.1; a duplication of 1p34.1-p34.2; and 
      in one family both a deletion of 18q21.1 and a duplication of 4q35.1-q35.2. The 
      probands were mentally retarded and had nonspecific dysmorphic features except for 
      one patient with the Bohring-Opitz syndrome. We considered the abnormalities in two 
      families to be clinically significant: In one family, the proband's brain 
      abnormality was comparable to previously reported abnormalities in individuals with 
      a similar duplication of 1p31-p32. Congenital heart disease was previously mapped to 
      the chromosomal region of 18q that was affected in the proband of another family. 
      The carrier parents in both families had mild clinical features. In two families the 
      abnormalities were considered as coincidental findings, and in two further families 
      the abnormalities were insufficient to explain the phenotypes of the probands but 
      possibly were related to a milder phenotype in other family members. These cases 
      illustrate the need for careful assessment of the extended family in order to 
      interpret the phenotypic consequences of abnormalities identified using array-CGH.

PG  - 582-94
AB  - The X-linked FG syndrome is characterised by mental retardation, congenital 
      hypotonia and constipation (which may both be severe), structural anal anomalies and 
      relative macrocephaly in some, and an unusual and characteristic facial appearance. 
      We describe 7 males from 4 families. One had anal stenosis. Two of the mothers and 
      one sister show probable carrier manifestations. The features of the FG syndrome are 
      individually non-specific. We emphasize that the characteristic combination of 
      features is needed to avoid overdiagnosis.

      and adaptive functioning, presenting before 18 y of age. Identifying the cause of ID 
      is important to provide treatment where available, genetic counseling, recurrence 
      risks and reproductive options for subsequent pregnancies. Advances in technology, 
      especially next generation sequencing and microarrays, have greatly increased the 
      diagnostic yield of evaluation in cases of ID. This paper describes the points in 
      history taking and examination in the evaluation of a proband, and discusses the 
      proper use of newer diagnostic technologies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: It has been reported that de novo heterozygous variants of DEAF1 can 
      cause DEAF1-associated neurodevelopmental disorder. The purpose of this article is 
      to explore the clinical and genetic characteristics of Chinese patients harboring de 
      novo DEAF1 variants. METHODS: We assembled a cohort of six unrelated patients with 
      de novo variants in DEAF1. Clinical and genetic features of these patients were 
      summarized. RESULTS: Each child showed intellectual disability (ID)/ global 
      developmental delay (GDD). Severe language impairment was prominent. Behavior 
      problems, seizures, sleep disturbance, and a high pain threshold were common 
      features. DEAF1-related seizures were reported to be difficult to treat or 
      intractable. Seizures in our cohort were almost all treatable. Valproic acid was the 
      most commonly used drug. Five heterozygous missense mutations of DEAF1 gene were 
      identified, three of which (p.W234C, p.L203P, p.H275Q) were not published in 
      literature before. CONCLUSION: Mutations of DEAF1 gene should be considered in 
      ID/GDD patients with a nonspecific phenotype, comprising intellectual disability, 
      prominent speech delay, abnormal behaviors, especially autism. In our study, 
      DEAF1-related epilepsy is completely treatable in Eastern-Asian individuals when 
      compared to patients in other regions, and valproic acid can be used as a first 
      choice. The knowledge of DEAF1-related neurodevelopmental disorder and the de novo 
      variant database of DEAF1 were expanded.

TI  - Cerebrofaciothoracic dysplasia: Four new patients with a recurrent TMCO1 pathogenic 
      variant.
PG  - 43-49
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.a.60678 [doi]
AB  - Biallelic loss of function variants in the TMCO1 gene have been previously 
      demonstrated to result in cerebrofaciothoracic dysplasia (CFTD; MIM #213980). The 
      phenotype of this condition includes severe intellectual disability, as well as 
      distinctive craniofacial features, including brachycephaly, synophrys, arched 
      eyebrows, "cupid's bow" upper lip, and microdontia. In addition, nonspecific 
      skeletal anomalies are common, including bifid ribs, scoliosis, and spinal fusion. 
      Only 19 molecularly confirmed patients have been previously described. Here, we 
      present four patients with CFTD, including three brothers from a Pakistani 
      background and an additional unrelated white Scottish patient. All share the 
      characteristic craniofacial appearance, with severe intellectual disability and 
      skeletal abnormalities. We further define the phenotype with comparison to the 
      published literature, and present images to define the dysmorphic features in a 
      previously unreported ethnic group. All of our patient series are homozygous for the 
      same c.292_293del (p.Ser98*) TMCO1 pathogenic variant, which has been previously 
      reported only in an isolated Amish population. Thus we provide evidence that CFTD 
      may be more common than previously thought. The patients presented here further 
      delineate the phenotypic spectrum of CFTD and provide evidence for a recurrent 
      pathogenic variant in TMCO1.

TI  - Familial heterogeneity in infantile autism.
PG  - 315-21
AB  - The incidence of autism and cognitive disability was assessed in the biological 
      siblings of 29 autistic probands subdivided on the basis of IQ. A significant 
      clustering of autism and nonspecific intellectual retardation was found in the 
      siblings of severely retarded autistic probands which was not present in the 
      siblings of our higher-functioning autistic sample. These findings suggest that 
      there may be etiological differences in autism, depending on the degree of 
      associated mental retardation.

AB  - Our study aimed at comparing, over a period of 3 years, the effectiveness of three 
      different educational approaches addressed to children with autism and severe mental 
      retardation. The first one was a treatment and education of autistic and related 
      communication handicapped children (TEACCH) program implemented in a residential 
      center; the second was a TEACCH program implemented at home and at mainstream 
      schools, after a specific parent psychoeducational training; the third approach 
      referred to inclusive education in mainstream schools, in which a nonspecific 
      approach was implemented. Each subject was assessed twice, using the 
      Psycho-Educational Profile-Revised (PEP-R) and Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale 
      (VABS)-survey form. Effectiveness of TEACCH appeared to be confirmed, showing 
      positive outcomes in the natural setting, and revealing its inclusive value.

TI  - IL1 receptor accessory protein like, a protein involved in X-linked mental 
      retardation, interacts with Neuronal Calcium Sensor-1 and regulates exocytosis.
PG  - 1415-25
AB  - Previously, human genetics-based approaches allowed us to show that mutations in the 
      IL-1 receptor accessory protein-like gene (IL1RAPL) are responsible for a 
      non-specific form of X-linked mental retardation. This gene encodes a predicted 
      protein of 696 amino acids that belongs to a novel class of the IL-1/Toll receptor 
      family. In addition to the extracellular portion consisting of three Ig-like domains 
      and the intracellular TIR domain characteristic of the IL-1/Toll receptor family, 
      IL1RAPL contains a specific 150 amino acid carboxy terminus that has no significant 
      homology with any protein of known function. In order to begin to elucidate the 
      function of this IL-1/Toll receptor-like protein, we have assessed the effect of 
      recombinant IL1RAPL on the binding affinity of type I IL-1R for its ligands 
      IL-1alpha and beta and searched for proteins interacting with the specific carboxy 
      terminus domain of IL1RAPL. Our results show that IL1RAPL is not a protein receptor 
      for IL-1. In addition we present here the identification of Neuronal Calcium 
      Sensor-1 (NCS-1) as an IL1RAPL interactor. Remarkably, although NCS-1 and its 
      non-mammalian homologue, frequenin, are members of a highly conserved EF-hand Ca(2+) 
      binding protein family, our data show that IL1RAPL interacts only with NCS-1 through 
      its specific C-terminal domain. The functional relevance of IL1RAPL activity was 
      further supported by the inhibitory effect on exocytosis in PC12 cells 
      overexpressing IL1RAPL. Taken together, our data suggest that IL1RAPL may regulate 
      calcium-dependent exocytosis and provide insight into the understanding of 
      physiopathological mechanisms underlying cognitive impairment resulting from IL1RAPL 
      dysfunction.

TI  - Parenting children with intellectual disability: linking maternal insightfulness to 
      sensitivity.
PG  - 1285-1289
LID - 10.1111/jir.12614 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study examined mothers' representation of their children's inner 
      world - maternal insightfulness - and its link to sensitive maternal behaviour. We 
      aimed to understand some of the parental processes that underlie parenting children 
      with intellectual disability (ID). METHODS: The sample included 38 mothers and their 
      children with non-specific ID aged 2.5 to 5.5 years. Children had developmental 
      quotient scores of M = 56.29, SD = 9.65 and adaptive behaviour scores of M = 60.72, 
      SD = 10.43. We hypothesised that mothers who were insightful show more sensitive 
      behaviour when interacting with their children than non-insightful mothers do. 
      Maternal insightfulness was assessed using the insightfulness interview, and 
      maternal sensitive behaviour during mother-child interaction was assessed using the 
      emotional availability observation scales. RESULTS: Forty-one per cent of the 
      mothers showed positive insightfulness regarding their children's inner world. These 
      mothers showed higher levels of sensitive behaviour than did the non-insightful 
      mothers. The insightfulness-sensitivity link was not associated with any of the 
      mothers' or the children's characteristics, including the level of developmental 
      quotient, suggesting that these parental constructs are not simply a reflection of 
      the level of the children's developmental delay. CONCLUSIONS: Better understanding 
      of the mechanism of parenthood, including the insightfulness-sensitivity link, may 
      help personalise the support provided to parents of children with ID. The 
      associations between maternal insightfulness and sensitivity imply that promoting 
      maternal insightfulness may enhance mothers' sensitivity towards their children.

LID - 10.1007/s12098-015-1764-9 [doi]
AB  - History of consanguinity is important in monogenic disorders as it supports 
      autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. This case report illustrates the use of 
      homozygosity mapping using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarray data to 
      identify the causative gene in a case with Warburg Micro syndrome (WARBM). This 
      syndrome has non-specific features like microcephaly and cataract; etiological 
      diagnosis based on clinical features is not possible. Four causative genes are known 
      for WARBM syndrome. In such a situation of autosomal recessive disorders of 
      heterogeneous etiologies, SNP microarray and homozygosity mapping is a useful and 
      cost effective strategy.

TI  - Outcome of the routine assessment of patients with mental retardation in a genetics 
      clinic.
PG  - 60-8
AB  - This study reviewed hospital and genetics clinic records of 411 patients evaluated 
      in our department from 1986 to 1997 inclusive. Major objectives were to establish 
      how often and under what circumstances a specific genetic/syndrome diagnosis was 
      made and to determine the value of laboratory tests in the hope of gaining a more 
      selective approach to referral, evaluation, and use of the laboratory. A specific 
      genetic/syndrome diagnosis was made in 19.9% of cases, and in a further 4.4% the 
      referring diagnosis was eliminated but no new diagnosis made. There was a 
      significant excess of affected males (277:134) and of affected male sib pairs over 
      expectation, suggesting an additional, potentially important, contribution from 
      nonspecific X-linked mental retardation (MR). Factors associated with making a 
      diagnosis included referral from a pediatrician or neurologist, absence of cerebral 
      palsy, presence of more than three minor anomalies and/or an unusual appearance, a 
      recognizable Gestalt or key anomaly. There was a linear relationship between the 
      likelihood of making a diagnosis and the number of minor anomalies. Factors not 
      associated with making a diagnosis included the year when the patient was seen, 
      degree of MR, number of prior specialists seen, presence of a major malformation, 
      occurrence of seizures, and a head circumference either <3rd or >97th centile. 
      Although chromosome studies were somewhat less likely to be ordered in patients with 
      less severe MR, the positive rate was unaffected by the severity of the MR. The rate 
      of abnormal results was positively correlated with the presence of minor anomalies 
      and/or an unusual appearance. None of 134 studies carried out on patients with </=3 
      minor anomalies alone were positive. Fragile X studies were less likely to be 
      ordered with increasing levels of MR and 10 of 14 positive test results were among 
      those with mild delay. Thirteen of 14 diagnoses were based on Gestalt. Molecular and 
      fluorescence in situ hybridization studies had a positive rate of >60% when ordered 
      by a clinical geneticist compared with 0% when ordered by other physicians. Results 
      showed that use of the laboratory was inconsistent and not clearly based on the 
      findings in a particular child. Significant changes in patterns of referral and the 
      evaluation process could be made that would result in significant economies of time 
      and laboratory use and a minimum level of missed diagnoses.

TI  - Dissection of an inverted X(p21.3q27.1) chromosome associated with mental 
      retardation.
PG  - 124-9
AB  - In a 6 year old boy referred for mental retardation, fragile X syndrome was ruled 
      out by cytogenetic and molecular analyses. Cytogenetic investigations revealed an 
      inverted X chromosome (p21.3q27.1). A similar chromosomal rearrangement was detected 
      in his mildly mentally retarded mother. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), 
      using a panel of ordered YAC clones, allowed the identification of YACs spanning 
      both the Xp21.3 and Xq27.1 breakpoints, where many non-specific mental retardation 
      loci have been reported so far. Further investigations by FISH showed that the 
      IL1RAPL1 gene at Xp21.3 was disrupted by the X chromosome inversion and therefore 
      its inactivation may be related to the mental retardation observed in our patients.

TI  - Localisation of a new gene for non-specific mental retardation to Xq22-q26 (MRX35).
PG  - 52-5
AB  - Non-specific mental retardation (MR) is a condition in which MR appears to be the 
      only consistent manifestation. The X linked form (MRX) is genetically heterogeneous. 
      We report clinical, cytogenetic, and linkage data on a family with X linked 
      non-specific MR. Two point and multi-point linkage analysis with 18 polymorphic 
      markers, covering the entire chromosome, showed close linkage to DXS1001 and DXS425 
      with a maximal lod score of 2.41 at 0% recombination. DXS178 and the gene for 
      hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl-transferase (HPRT), located in Xq22 and Xq26 
      respectively, flank the mutation. All other chromosomal regions could be excluded 
      with odds of at least 100:1. To our knowledge there is currently no other 
      non-specific MR gene mapped to this region. Therefore, the gene causing MR in this 
      family can be considered to be a new, independent MRX locus (MRX35).

TI  - Is the good-imitator-poor-talker profile syndrome-specific in Down syndrome?: 
      evidence from standardised imitation and language measures.
PG  - 148-57
LID - 10.1016/j.ridd.2010.09.010 [doi]
AB  - The emergence of the Down syndrome (DS) behavioural phenotype during early 
      development may be of great importance for early intervention. The main goal of this 
      study was to investigate the good-imitator-poor-talker developmental profile in DS 
      at preschool age. Twenty children with Down syndrome (DS; mean nonverbal mental age 
      NMA 1 y10 m) and 15 children with non-specific mental retardation (NS-MR; mean NMA 1 
      y11 m) participated in this study. The Preschool Imitation and Praxis Scale (PIPS) 
      and the Dutch version of the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventories 
      (N-CDI) were used to determine absolute and relative (contrasted to a nonverbal 
      mental age reference) imitation and language abilities. Results revealed that there 
      was clear evidence for a good-imitator-poor-talker profile in preschoolers with DS. 
      However, only the advanced bodily imitation ability seems to be syndrome-specific. 
      Clinical implications of these findings are considered.

TI  - Two novel mutations in SLC6A8 cause creatine transporter defect and distinctive 
      X-linked mental retardation in two unrelated Dutch families.
PG  - 288-95
AB  - Four Dutch male patients, two brothers from unrelated families were referred for 
      investigation of psychomotor and severe language/speech delay. All four patients 
      showed growth deficiency over the years. Facial features and poor body habitus were 
      quite similar in the patients and in their mothers. Brain MRI showed nonspecific 
      periventricular white matter lesions. In all the patients neuropsychological tests 
      revealed moderate mental retardation, attention deficit and hyperactivity with 
      impulsivity, a semantic-pragmatic language disorder, and oral dyspraxia. This 
      specific cognitive profile is different from other children with mental retardation 
      syndromes and seems to be unique. Excretion of creatine to creatinine ratio in urine 
      of the four boys was increased compared to controls and their creatine uptake in 
      fibroblasts was deficient. In the two brothers from the first pedigree, DNA sequence 
      analysis revealed a novel mutation in the splice donor site in intron 10 (IVS10 + 
      5G>C, c.1495 + 5G>C) of the SLC6A8 gene leading to skipping of exon 10. In the other 
      sib pair a novel missense mutation (c. 1361C>T; p.Pro544Leu) was found. These are 
      the first families reported, in which the clinical suspicion of a creatine 
      transporter disorder was raised on clinical grounds, before a brain 1H-MRS suggested 
      the diagnosis. Screening of apparently X-linked mental retarded patients with this 
      somatic and behavioral phenotype by the biochemical assay of creatine to creatinine 
      ratio in the urine or DNA sequence analysis of SLC6A8 is worthwhile even when 1H-MRS 
      is not available.

AB  - Secretory fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) and their receptors are known for their 
      regulatory function in the early stages of neural development. FGF13, a nonsecretory 
      protein of the FGF family, is expressed in cerebral cortical neurons during 
      development and is a candidate gene for syndromal and nonspecific forms of 
      X-chromosome-linked mental retardation (XLMR). However, its function during 
      development remains unclear. We show that FGF13 acts intracellularly as a 
      microtubule-stabilizing protein required for axon and leading process development 
      and neuronal migration in the cerebral cortex. FGF13 is enriched in axonal growth 
      cones and interacts directly with microtubules. Furthermore, FGF13 polymerizes 
      tubulins and stabilizes microtubules. The loss of FGF13 impairs neuronal 
      polarization and increases the branching of axons and leading processes. Genetic 
      deletion of FGF13 in mice results in neuronal migration defects in both the 
      neocortex and the hippocampus. FGF13-deficient mice also exhibit weakened learning 
      and memory, which is correlated to XLMR patients' intellectual disability.

TI  - Infant-onset progressive myoclonus epilepsy.
PG  - 134-42
AB  - We report the clinical, electroencephalographic, neurophysiologic, and neuroimaging 
      findings in eight children with infant-onset progressive myoclonus epilepsy, all of 
      whom had muscle biopsies performed as as part of the diagnostic evaluation. Each 
      child had myoclonic seizures, generalized tonic-clonic seizures, and neurologic 
      regression or marked developmental delay. Four children died before 3 years of age. 
      Electroencephalograms in seven children showed an abnormally slow background with 
      bilateral multifocal paroxysmal discharges but no burst suppression pattern or 
      photoparoxysmal response. Muscle biopsy specimens were submitted for histopathology 
      and respiratory-chain enzyme studies. Nonspecific abnormalities on light microscopy 
      or electron microscopy were found in seven samples, including increased 
      subsarcolemmal deposits of mitochondria or morphologic mitochondrial changes, but no 
      ragged-red fibers were seen. Respiratory-chain enzyme studies were performed on five 
      samples and in three children (all of whom had a history of elevated lactate in 
      serum or cerebrospinal fluid), there were low levels of rotenone-sensitive reduced 
      nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) cytochrome c reductase characteristic of a 
      defect in the complex I part of the respiratory-chain pathway. This study has shown 
      that infant-onset progressive myoclonus epilepsy can be distinguished from other 
      myoclonic epilepsy syndromes of infancy by clinical and electrographic features. 
      Furthermore, respiratory-chain enzyme defects are a relatively common cause of 
      infant-onset progressive myoclonus epilepsy. The absence of ragged-red fibers on 
      muscle histopathology does not preclude a mitochondrial enzyme abnormality.

TI  - A third MRX family (MRX68) is the result of mutation in the long chain fatty 
      acid-CoA ligase 4 (FACL4) gene: proposal of a rapid enzymatic assay for screening 
      mentally retarded patients.
PG  - 11-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: The gene encoding fatty acid CoA ligase 4 (FACL4) is mutated in families 
      with non-specific X linked mental retardation (MRX) and is responsible for cognitive 
      impairment in the contiguous gene syndrome ATS-MR (Alport syndrome and mental 
      retardation), mapped to Xq22.3. This finding makes this gene a good candidate for 
      other mental retardation disorders mapping in this region. METHODS: We have screened 
      the FACL4 gene in eight families, two MRX and six syndromic X linked mental 
      retardation (MRXS), mapping in a large interval encompassing Xq22.3. RESULTS: We 
      have found a missense mutation in MRX68. The mutation (c.1001C>T in the brain 
      isoform) cosegregates with the disease and changes a highly conserved proline into a 
      leucine (p.P375L) in the first luciferase domain, which markedly reduces the 
      enzymatic activity. Furthermore, all heterozygous females showed completely skewed X 
      inactivation in blood leucocytes, as happens in all reported females with other 
      FACL4 point mutations or deletions. CONCLUSIONS: Since the FACL4 gene is highly 
      expressed in brain, where it encodes a brain specific isoform, and is located in 
      hippocampal and cerebellar neurones, a role for this gene in cognitive processes can 
      be expected. Here we report the third MRX family with a FACL4 mutation and describe 
      the development of a rapid enzymatic assay on peripheral blood that we propose as a 
      sensitive, robust, and efficient diagnostic tool in mentally retarded males.

TI  - Non-specific X linked mental retardation with aphasia exhibiting genetic linkage to 
      chromosomal region Xp11.
PG  - 629-34
AB  - A new type of non-specific X linked mental retardation is described in a three 
      generation family. The three affected males had severe mental retardation (IQ 20 to 
      30), mutism, growth failure, frequent infections, seizures, and the following minor 
      anomalies: brachycephaly, frontal hair whorl, square face, large mouth, thick lips, 
      and prognathism. There was not a characteristic facies. Normal laboratory studies on 
      the proband included a karyotype with fragile X screening, skeletal survey, blood 
      amino acid, urine organic acid, and HGPRT levels. Linkage analysis was performed 
      with 10 X chromosome DNA probes of which probe DXS255 at chromosomal region Xp11.22 
      gave a maximal two point lod score of 2.10 if phase was inferred and 1.20 if it was 
      not. Crossovers were shown with probes mapping to regions Xp22, Xp21, and Xq28. 
      Comparison of these patients with 80 X linked causes of mental retardation, 
      including 41 which might be classified as 'non-specific', showed no other disorders 
      compatible with the phenotypic and linkage data.

TI  - Delineation of the clinical phenotype associated with OPHN1 mutations based on the 
      clinical and neuropsychological evaluation of three families.
PG  - 314-7
AB  - Recent reports have demonstrated that mutations in the OPHN1 gene were responsible 
      for a syndromic rather than non-specific mental retardation. Abnormalities of the 
      posterior fossa with cerebellar hypoplasia have been demonstrated in all male 
      patients reported to date. We report here a new family with X-linked mental 
      retardation due to mutation in OPHN1 and present unpublished data about two families 
      previously reported, concerning the facial and psychological phenotype of affected 
      males and carrier females. Our study confirms that cerebellar hypoplasia is a 
      hallmark of this syndrome. In addition, affected males display facial similarities 
      that can help the diagnosis. Most carrier females have mild mental retardation and 
      subtle facial changes.

TI  - Ethological approach to autism spectrum disorders.
PG  - 223-44
AB  - The purpose of the study was to develop a new ethogram for the assessment of 
      children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and intellectual 
      developmental disorder (IDD) and to test whether this instrument accurately 
      distinguishes ASD participants (n = 61) from IDD participants (n = 61). An ethogram 
      with 88 behavior elements was generated, including body postures, verbalizations, 
      facial expressions, motor stereotypies, head postures, gaze behavior, gestures, and 
      interpersonal distance. Significant differences were detected between both groups in 
      classic ASD behaviors; in behaviors that are deficient in ASD according to 
      established theoretical models, such as symbolic play, gaze direction, gaze 
      following, and use of mental state language; in atypical behaviors that have also 
      been described previously in ethological studies with ASD; and in the nonspecific 
      behaviors of ASD, such as walk, look own body, explore, and cry. The predictive 
      success of a diagnosis of ASD in the logistic regression model with the ethogram's 
      factors was 98.4%. The results suggest that this ethogram is a powerful and useful 
      tool for both the detailed study of the social behaviors of autistic children and 
      adolescents, and for discriminating ASD and IDD.

TI  - A gene for non-specific X-linked mental retardation (MRX55) is located in Xp11.
PG  - 11-6
AB  - A new family with a non-specific X-linked mental retardation (MRX55) is described. 
      An X-linked recessive inheritance is suggested by the segregation from two healthy 
      transmitting females of moderate mental retardation in three males, without any 
      specific clinical, radiological or biological features. Two point linkage analysis 
      demonstrated significant linkage between the disorder and several markers in Xp11 
      (Zmax = 2.11, theta = 0); multipoint linkage analyses confirmed the significant 
      linkage with a maximum lod score (Z = 2.11 at theta = 0, at DXS8012). Recombination 
      events observed with the flanking markers DXS1068 and DXS1275 delineate a 34 
      centimorgan interval in the pericentromeric region. The interval of assignment 
      pointed out in this family overlaps with several MRX loci previously reported in 
      Xp11 which are reviewed here in.

TI  - Localization of a non-specific X-linked mental retardation gene, MRX23, to Xq23-q24.
PG  - 411-4
AB  - More than 100 X-linked mental retardation syndromes have been described. We report 
      the localization of the disease gene, MRX23, in one family to Xq23-24. Affected 
      family members present with non-specific X-linked mental retardation with verbal 
      disability (BDOAS 10, 1-100). MRX23 is tightly linked to the markers DXS1220 (Z = 
      3.76 at theta = 0.1) and DXS424 (Z = 3.9 at theta = 0.06). Multipoint linkage 
      analysis, taking five loci (DXS1072-0.07-DXS1220-0.014-MRX23-0.01-DXS 
      424-0.08-DXS1001) at a time, gives a maximum LOD score of 6.7 between these two 
      markers. The next most likely location, between DXS424 and DXS1001 is 120-fold less 
      likely. Haplotype analysis also indicates the most likely location for the disease 
      gene is between DXS1220 and DXS424.

TI  - De novo MECP2 frameshift mutation in a boy with moderate mental retardation, obesity 
      and gynaecomastia.
PG  - 359-62
AB  - Rett syndrome (RTT) is an X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations 
      in the MECP2 gene, with apparent lethality in male embryos. However, recent studies 
      indicate that mutations in the MECP2 gene can cause congenital encephalopathy, an 
      Angelman-like phenotype and even nonspecific mental retardation in males. We report 
      on a 10-year-old boy with moderate mental retardation, hypotonia, obesity and 
      gynaecomastia and a de novo 2-bp deletion in the MECP2 gene that resulted in a 
      frameshift and premature stop codon. As some of the clinical features were 
      suggestive of the Prader-Willi syndrome, it might be worthwhile screening for MECP2 
      mutations in patients with an atypical Prader-Willi phenotype but without the 
      characteristic abnormalities on chromosome 15q. This report contributes to the 
      phenotypic knowledge of male patients with MECP2 mutations. Moreover, this is the 
      first reported male case of a de novo MECP2 mutation.

TI  - Localization of non-specific X-linked mental retardation gene (MRX73) to Xp22.2.
PG  - 200-4
AB  - Clinical and molecular studies are reported on a family (MRX73) of five males with 
      non-specific X-linked mental retardation (XLMR). A total of 33 microsatellite and 
      RFLP markers was typed. The gene for this XLMR condition was been linked to DXS1195, 
      with a lod score of 2.36 at theta = 0. The haplotype and multipoint linkage analyses 
      suggest localization of the MRX73 locus to an interval of 2 cM defined by markers 
      DXS8019 and DXS365, in Xp22.2. This interval contains the gene of Coffin-Lowry 
      syndrome (RSK2), where a missense mutation has been associated with a form of 
      non-specific mental retardation. Therefore, a search for RSK2 mutations was 
      performed in the MRX73 family, but no causal mutation was found. We hypothesize that 
      another unidentified XLMR gene is located near RSK2.

TI  - MRX8: an X-linked mental retardation condition with linkage to Xq21.
PG  - 467-74
AB  - A family in which 6 males have X-linked mental retardation has been studied with 
      polymorphic DNA probes. The males differ from unaffected males only in impaired 
      intellect and in smaller head size. The gene that causes mental retardation in the 
      family appears to be located in band Xq21 on the basis of linkage with 3 markers: 
      DXS250, DXS345 and DXS3 (theta max = 0.00; Zmax = 1.6). A multipoint lod score of 
      2.36 was obtain with no recombination relative to DXS326 in Xq21. This family is 
      considered to have nonspecific X-linked mental retardation and has been given the 
      designation MRX8.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Attachment theory produced a fertile field of research and clinical 
      application. Although the topic of attachment of children with intellectual 
      disability (ID) has received increasing research attention over the past 15 years, 
      the empirical evidence is still limited. AIMS: We applied theoretical and empirical 
      knowledge of parenting typically developing children to examine the mother-child 
      relationship in the ID population. The aim was to examine maternal sensitivity and 
      structuring and its association with children's attachment classification and their 
      disability. METHODS: Forty preschool children (mean age 47.25, range 26-75 months) 
      with non-specific ID and their mothers participated in the study. The mean 
      developmental age was 25.92 months (SD = 10.89), The DQ mean score was 55.45 
      (SD = 17.28). We assessed children's quality of attachment using the SSP and 
      maternal interactive behavior using the Emotional Availability Scales. OUTCOMES: 
      Forty percent of children showed secure attachment, and 32.5% showed disorganized 
      attachment. Attachment classifications correlated significantly with maternal 
      sensitivity and maternal structuring but not with the child's cognitive disability. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The results point to the importance of maternal interactive behavior 
      for children with ID. Clinical implication may consider interventions aiming to 
      enhance maternal sensitivity and structuring to improve children's quality of 
      attachment.

TI  - Neuroimaging in nine patients with inversion duplication of the short arm of 
      chromosome 8.
PG  - 83-7
AB  - Inversion duplication 8p is a rare chromosome disorder characterised by severe 
      mental retardation, minor facial dysmorphisms, and corpus callosum agenesis. Few 
      cerebral imaging studies have been reported. We describe 9 patients with an 
      inversion duplication 8p, involving variable segments of the short arm of chromosome 
      8. MRI was performed in 8 patients and 2 patients underwent CT scanning. The images 
      were systematically reviewed. All patients suffered from severe mental retardation. 
      Head circumference was between 0 and + 2 SD in 7 patients. The corpus callosum was 
      absent in 6, and thin (but complete) in 3 patients. Hypoplasia of the (inferior) 
      cerebellar vermis was observed in 6 patients. Enlargement of the ventricular system 
      and associated hippocampal maldevelopment were found in all patients. The 
      supratentorial external CSF spaces were enlarged in 6 patients, and in 3 patients 
      there was a remarkable enlargement of the retrocerebellar arachnoidal space. 
      Cerebral white matter showed mildly delayed myelination in 7 patients, and 
      periventricular lesions of variable extent in 6 patients. The pattern of imaging 
      abnormalities was non-specific, but remarkably similar between patients. We found no 
      correlation between the severity of the clinical features, imaging results, and 
      extent of the chromosomal aberration.

TI  - MECP2 mutations and clinical correlations in Greek children with Rett syndrome and 
      associated neurodevelopmental disorders.
PG  - 487-95
LID - 10.1016/j.braindev.2011.09.002 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mutations in the MECP2 gene (methyl-CpG-binding protein-2) are 
      responsible for 60-95% of cases of Rett syndrome (RTT), an X-linked dominant 
      neurodevelopmental disorder affecting mostly girls. Classic RTT is characterized by 
      normal early development followed by psychomotor regression and onset of 
      microcephaly, although variant forms are also observed. MECP2 has also been 
      implicated in variable mental retardation (MR) phenotypes, including X-linked Mental 
      Retardation (XLMR), Fragile-X-like Syndrome (FXS) and Angelman-like (AS) phenotypes. 
      AIM: The aim of the study was: (a) to evaluate the incidence and spectrum of MECP2 
      mutations in children with RTT and variant MR; (b) to evaluate phenotype-genotype 
      correlations. METHODS: Exons 3-4 were analyzed for mutations in 281 MR patients 
      (aged 13 months-27 years old, 144 males-137 females) consisting of 88 patients 
      referred for RTT and 193 patients referred for AS-like and FXS-like types of MR. 
      Statistical analysis included correlation between classic MECP2-positive and 
      MECP2-negative and variant RTT patients, and frequency of MECP2 mutations in the 
      various categories. RESULTS: Mutations were detected in ≈ 70% of classic and ≈ 21% 
      of variant RTT, respectively. Amongst MR cases, 2.1% carried MECP2 mutations. 
      MECP2-positive females had more problems in ambulation, muscle tone, tremor and 
      ataxia, respiratory disturbances, head growth, hand use and stereotypies. Classic 
      RTT-positive versus negative had significant respiratory and sitting problems and 
      versus variant RTT-positive females ambulatory, hand and stereotypies problems. 
      CONCLUSION: The analysis of the MECP2 gene could provide a diagnostic tool for RTT 
      and non-specific MR research.

AB  - PURPOSE: Dup15q syndrome is a rare genetic disease with a fairly nonspecific 
      phenotype, clinical heterogeneity, and a wide spectrum of severity. However, no 
      formal characterization has been attempted to select clusters of symptoms, signs and 
      instrumental tests, to be used in the differential diagnosis with other 
      neurodevelopmental disorders. Thus, our purpose was to identify symptoms, signs and 
      instrumental findings, singly or in various combinations, favoring the early 
      diagnosis of the Dup15q syndrome and the indication for genetic testing. METHODS: 25 
      patients with Dup15q syndrome and 25 age and sex matched controls with other 
      neurodevelopmental disorders were the study population. Patients' history, clinical 
      and instrumental assessment were examined by five expert child neurologists blind to 
      the genetic diagnosis. Each rater was asked to make the diagnosis in three 
      subsequent steps: 1. Revision of the medical records; 2. Examination of the 
      videorecorded clinical findings; 3. Assessment of the instrumental tests. 
      Inter-rater agreement was measured with the Kendall's coefficient of concordance) 
      and the Kappa statistic. Sensitivity, specificity and predictive values for 
      symptoms, signs and instrumental findings, singly or in various combinations, were 
      measured. RESULTS: The Kendall's coefficient for the diagnosis of Dup15q syndrome 
      was 0.43 at step 1 was 0.43, at step 2 was 0.42, at step 3. Patients with past 
      feeding difficulties, hypotonia during the neonatal period, and epilepsy had >80 % 
      probability of having the Dup15q syndrome. CONCLUSION: Feeding difficulties, 
      hypotonia and epilepsy, though unspecific, can be used as signals of Dup15q syndrome 
      and focused search of genetic abnormalities.

TI  - [Clinical and genetic consequences of ring chromosome, a structural genome 
      mutation].
PG  - 379-81
AB  - Ring chromosome is a peculiar genetic anomaly which may cause phenotypic 
      abnormalities even without a loss of genetic material. The ring formation of 
      chromosome ends induces difficulties in the sister chromatid separation at cell 
      division, resulting in increased cell death rate through the generation of secondary 
      aneuploid cells. Based on the in vitro analyses of own cases and a review of more 
      than 200 case reports published in the literature, the author presents some 
      conclusions on "ring syndrome", a non-specific clinical manifestation of ring 
      formation of any chromosome, consisting of the lack of (or poorly expressed) organic 
      manifestations, mild or borderline mental retardation, and a severe growth failure 
      which is not explained by organic, biochemical, or endocrine findings. It is also 
      suggested that the phenotypic manifestation of a ring chromosome is even less 
      expressed when the ring is transmitted to the next generation. Based on observations 
      of ring behaviour and the clinical phenotypes in a 3-generational family with a 
      mosaic supernumerary ring, it is not unrealistic to assume that there is a 
      transgenerational increase in the severity of the clinical manifestation resulting 
      from a less efficient elimination process against the ring (cytogenetic 
      anticipation).

TI  - Further linkage evidence for localization of mutational sites for nonsyndromic types 
      of X-linked mental retardation at the pericentromeric region.
PG  - 107-12
AB  - We used several microsatellite markers scattered along the X chromosome to search 
      for linkage relationships in a large Sardinian pedigree segregating for nonspecific 
      X-linked mental retardation (MRX). Markers DXS573 and AR, located at chromosomal 
      subregions Xp11.4-p11.22 and Xq11.2-q12, respectively, were found to segregate in 
      full concordance with the disease, leading to a LOD score of 4.21 at zero 
      recombination value. Recombination with the disease was found with markers MAOB and 
      DXS454 located at Xp11.4-p11.3 and Xq21.1-q22, respectively; accordingly, markers 
      distal to Xp11.4 and Xq22 also segregated independently of the disease. These 
      findings provide strong linkage evidence in favor of the localization of one MRX 
      mutational site in the pericentromeric region of the human X chromosome, justifying 
      the assignment of a new symbol (MRX26) to our pedigree. Finally, on the basis of the 
      recombinational events observed in the Xq21-q22 region, we have been able to refine 
      the assignment of marker DXS456 to Xq21.33-q22.

TI  - Familial Williams-Beuren syndrome ascertained by screening rather than targeted 
      diagnosis.

AB  - Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS), a contiguous gene deletion syndrome, mostly occurs 
      sporadically. Although a few cases of familial WBS have been reported in the 
      literature, molecular confirmation of the deletion has not been carried out in all 
      of them. Here, we report on the eighth clinically and molecularly confirmed 
      inherited WBS detected in a family with 'familial mental retardation.' A 
      comprehensive screening approach to mental retardation that included stepwise 
      karyotyping, assessment for fragile-X syndrome, subtelomeric rearrangements and 
      known microdeletion/microduplication syndromes, and a genome-wide array-CGH study 
      was applied. The father, the mother, and their daughter were all mentally 
      handicapped with nonspecific clinical manifestations and dysmorphic features. The 
      first child of the family died from multiple congenital anomalies. The father and 
      his daughter, who had never been suspected to have WBS, were diagnosed as having a 
      deletion of the WBS critical region. No other abnormalities were detected in the 
      family. Unlike other previously reported cases, in which the disease was ascertained 
      on the basis of clinical manifestations, the present report represents an example of 
      the detection of cryptic chromosomal abnormalities in mental retardation patients by 
      the stepwise application of high-throughput screening methods.

TI  - A new gene involved in X-linked mental retardation identified by analysis of an X;2 
      balanced translocation.
PG  - 167-70
AB  - X-linked forms of mental retardation (MR) affect approximately 1 in 600 males and 
      are likely to be highly heterogeneous. They can be categorized into syndromic (MRXS) 
      and nonspecific (MRX) forms. In MRX forms, affected patients have no distinctive 
      clinical or biochemical features. At least five MRX genes have been identified by 
      positional cloning, but each accounts for only 0.5%-1.0% of MRX cases. Here we show 
      that the gene TM4SF2 at Xp11.4 is inactivated by the X breakpoint of an X;2 balanced 
      translocation in a patient with MR. Further investigation led to identification of 
      TM4SF2 mutations in 2 of 33 other MRX families. RNA in situ hybridization showed 
      that TM4SF2 is highly expressed in the central nervous system, including the 
      cerebral cortex and hippocampus. TM4SF2 encodes a member of the tetraspanin family 
      of proteins, which are known to contribute in molecular complexes including beta-1 
      integrins. We speculate that through this interaction, TM4SF2 might have a role in 
      the control of neurite outgrowth.

AB  - A large kindred is described in which 22 males and 3 females show non-specific 
      mental retardation with impaired speech. An X-linked recessive is the most likely 
      mode of inheritance of this condition. Similar families have been described in the 
      literature, characteristic physical abnormalities are absent and performance I.Q. 
      tends to be higher than verbal I.Q. This possible heterogenous condition may be a 
      major individual cause of mental deficiency in males, and may account for the excess 
      of male retardates in the population.

TI  - [Clinical and molecular screening for fragile X syndrome in 300 patients with 
      non-specific mental retardation].
PG  - 911-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fragile X syndrome is the most frequent cause of mental retardation 
      linked to the X chromosome. In the majority of cases, the mutation responsible for 
      the syndrome is an expansion of the trinucleotide repeat (CGG)n, present in the 5' 
      region of exon 1 of the gene for mental retardation associated with fragile X 
      syndrome (FMR-1). AIM: To report the results of a fragile X screening in patients 
      with mental retardation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fragile X screening using polymerase 
      chain reaction methods was done in 386 X chromosomes from 300 patients (214 male), 
      aged 4 to 26 years old. The modified Hagerman test was applied to male patients. 
      Hybridization techniques were applied in a subgroup of 51 patients. RESULTS: (CGG)n 
      30 was the allele found with the highest frequency in 50.2% of patients. (CGG)n 29 
      was found in 29% of patients. One subject had an allele with 46 CGG repeats, which 
      corresponds to the gray zone. Hybridization studies were highly concordant with PCR, 
      detecting four males with fragile X syndrome and a carrier female. The average 
      clinical score of mental retardation not due to fragile X syndrome was 10.3 +/- 3.4 
      (range 3 to 23), and 97% of males had a score below 19. The concordance between 
      scores over 20 and molecular genotype was 98%. CONCLUSIONS: The distribution of 
      (CGG)n repeats, observed in this study, was significantly different to that 
      previously reported for a normal Chilean population. The dispersion of molecular 
      status and clinical score was lower than previously described using cytogenetic 
      techniques.

TI  - Mutations in the C-terminus of CDKL5: proceed with caution.
PG  - 270-2
LID - 10.1038/ejhg.2013.133 [doi]
AB  - Mutations in the cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5) gene have been described in 
      girls with Rett-like features and early-onset epileptic encephalopathy including 
      infantile spasms. Milder phenotypes have been associated with sequence variations in 
      the 3'-end of the CDKL5 gene. Identification of novel CDKL5 transcripts coding 
      isoforms characterized by an altered C-terminal region strongly questions the 
      eventual pathogenicity of sequence variations located in the 3'-end of the gene. We 
      investigated a group of 30 female patients with a clinically heterogeneous phenotype 
      ranging from nonspecific intellectual disability to a severe neonatal encephalopathy 
      and identified two heterozygous CDKL5 missense mutations, the previously reported 
      p.Val999Met and the novel mutation p.Pro944Thr. However, these mutations have also 
      been detected in their healthy father. Considering our results and all data from the 
      literature, we suggest that genetic variations beyond the codon 938 in human 
      CDKL5115 protein may have minor or no significance. It is probable that screening of 
      exons 19-21 of the CDKL5 gene is not useful in practical molecular diagnosis of 
      atypical Rett syndrome.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation constitutes a group of 
      rare progressive movement disorders sharing intellectual disability and neuroimaging 
      findings as common denominators. Beta-propeller protein-associated neurodegeneration 
      (BPAN) represents approximately 7% of the cases, and its first signs are typically 
      epilepsy and developmental delay. We aimed to describe in detail the phenotype of 
      BPAN with a special focus on iron metabolism. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We present a 
      cohort of paediatric patients with pathogenic variants of WD-Repeat Domain 45 gene 
      (WDR45). The diagnosis was established by targeted panel sequencing of genes 
      associated with epileptic encephalopathies (n = 9) or by Sanger sequencing of WDR45 
      (n = 1). Data on clinical characteristics, molecular-genetic findings and other 
      performed investigations were gathered from all participating centres. Markers of 
      iron metabolism were analysed in 6 patients. RESULTS: Ten children (3 males, 7 
      females, median age 8.4 years) from five centres (Prague, Berlin, Vogtareuth, 
      Tubingen and Cologne) were enrolled in the study. All patients manifested first 
      symptoms (e.g. epilepsy, developmental delay) between 2 and 31 months (median 16 
      months). Seven patients were seizure-free (6 on antiepileptic medication, one 
      drug-free) at the time of data collection. Neurological findings were non-specific 
      with deep tendon hyperreflexia (n = 4) and orofacial dystonia (n = 3) being the most 
      common. Soluble transferrin receptor/log ferritin ratio was elevated in 5/6 examined 
      subjects; other parameters of iron metabolism were normal. CONCLUSION: Severity of 
      epilepsy often gradually decreases in BPAN patients. Elevation of soluble 
      transferrin receptor/log ferritin ratio could be another biochemical marker of the 
      disease and should be explored by further studies.

TI  - Genetic Variants of the MTMR9 Gene Are Associated with Nonspecific Intellectual 
      Disability: A Family-Based Association Study.
PG  - 625-631
LID - 10.1089/gtmb.2020.0145 [doi]
AB  - Background: Mutations within the myotubularin-related protein 9 gene (MTMR9) have 
      been identified in several families with nonsyndromic intellectual disability 
      (NSID), a generalized neurodevelopmental disorder; however, the relationship between 
      MTMR9 and NSID needs to be verified using a larger sample size. Aim: To explore 
      whether genetic variants in the MTMR9 gene are linked to susceptibility of NSID 
      among the Chinese population. Materials and Methods: Seven single nucleotide 
      polymorphisms (SNPs) of the MTMR9 gene (rs4559208, rs3824211, rs2164272, rs2164273, 
      rs1897951, rs6991606, and rs7815802) were analyzed using family-based association 
      testing among 258 Han Chinese NSID families. Results: Three SNPs of MTMR9 were 
      significantly associated with NSID (z = 2.152, p = 0.031 for rs4559208; z = 2.403, 
      p = 0.016 for rs2164273; and z = 2.758, p = 0.006 for rs7815802). Three alleles of 
      these SNPs were more likely to be transferred from the carrier parents to the 
      affected offspring. Haplotypes constructed using these SNPs also showed a similar 
      transmitting trend (z = 2.505, p = 0.012, χ(2)((3)) = 8.835, and global p = 0.032). 
      Carriers with the G-G-C haplotype showed a higher risk of NSID (odds ratio = 1.46, 
      95% confidence interval [1.01-2.09], p = 0.04) than others. In silico functional 
      predictions supported an etiological role for these three SNPs in NSID biology. 
      Conclusions: This study provides additional insights into the association of NSID 
      with specific alleles, and haplotypes within the MTMR9 gene. Genotypic analyses of 
      the MTMR9 gene should be considered for patients presenting with NSID of unknown 
      etiology.

TI  - Refining behavioral phenotypes: personality-motivation in Williams and Prader-Willi 
      syndromes.
PG  - 158-69
AB  - Despite behavioral differences, individuals with Williams or Prader-Willi syndrome 
      share a proneness to certain personality characteristics. We hypothesized that there 
      are qualitative differences in these shared personality features. 
      Personality-motivation (measured using the Reiss Profiles) was compared for equal 
      numbers of age- and gender-matched individuals with Williams or Prader-Willi 
      syndrome or mental retardation due to nonspecific causes. Each syndrome featured 
      aberrant motivational profiles, and similarities were found across groups in various 
      domains. Significant differences emerged in the specific stimuli that motivated 
      behavior in several Reiss Profile domains. Implications are discussed for the 
      "classic" sociable personality in Williams syndrome and for compulsivity in 
      Prader-Willi syndrome. Recommendations are made for treatment and more refined 
      phenotypic research.

TI  - Gene for non-specific X-linked mental retardation maps in the pericentromeric

PG  - 224-7
AB  - Linkage analysis was carried out in a large four-generation German family 
      segregating for non-specific X-linked mental retardation. Affected males have 
      moderate intellectual handicap. Speech delay, deviant behaviour, and hyperactivity 
      have also been reported. Head circumference and testicular volumes are normal. 
      Cytogenetic analysis failed to show evidence for fragile site or structural 
      abnormality of the X chromosome. None of the obligatory carriers shows any clinical 
      symptoms. Close linkage without recombination (lod scores 1.74 to 2.05) has been 
      found between the disease locus (MRX1) and the polymorphic DNA loci DXS7 
      (Xp11.4-p11.3), MAOA (Xp11.3-p11.23), DXS255 (Xp11.22), and DXS159 (Xq12) suggesting 
      that the gene responsible for the disease in this family maps in the pericentromeric 
      region of the X chromosome. Linkage data obtained with the flanking marker loci OTC 
      (Xp21.1) and DXS95 (Xq21.2-q21.3) also were compatible with this localization of the 
      MRX1 gene. Close linkage to loci from Xp22, Xq22, Xq24-25, or Xq28 could be 
      excluded.

TI  - A case of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in a patient with FOXG1-related disorder.
PG  - e116-9
LID - 10.1111/epi.12800 [doi]
AB  - Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a drug-resistant epileptic encephalopathy of 
      childhood with a heterogeneous etiology. Recently, genome-wide association studies 
      have led to the identification of new de novo mutations associated with this 
      epileptic syndrome. Herein, we report an 8-year-old child with intellectual 
      disability, severe postnatal microcephaly, Rett-like features, and LGS, carrying a 
      de novo missense mutation in the forkhead box G1 (FOXG1) gene. This gene is 
      responsible for FOXG1 syndrome, characterized by severe postnatal microcephaly, 
      moderate postnatal growth deficiency, mental retardation with poor social 
      interaction, stereotyped behavior and dyskinesias, absent language, sleep disorders, 
      and epilepsy. Nonspecific epilepsy syndromes have been associated with this genetic 
      disorder. Thus, we hypothesize that FOXG1 might be a new candidate gene in the 
      etiology of LGS and suggest screening for this gene in cases of LGS with concomitant 
      microcephaly and clinical features overlapping with Rett syndrome.

AB  - Thirty adults with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) were compared with 30 adults with 
      non-specific learning disability matched for age, sex and severity of mental 
      retardation. Maladaptive behaviour was assessed with the Aberrant Behavior Checklist 
      (ABC), a 58-item structured interview which rates behaviours from 0 (not a problem) 
      to 3 (severe problem) and which yields five factors (I) irritability, agitation; 
      (II) lethargy, withdrawal; (III) stereotypic behavior; (IV) hyperactivity, 
      non-compliance; and (V) inappropriate speech). The PWS sample had significantly 
      higher factor I (P < 0.001) and factor V (P < 0.05) scores. The PWS sample had mean 
      scores above 1 for 17 ABC items; the contrast subjects had no mean scores above 1. 
      The factor I scores for the PWS sample were similar to those of inpatients in 
      hospital facilities for adults with mental retardation and mental illness or 
      severely challenging behaviour. The results support previous work, and extend it by 
      suggesting that temper tantrums, self-injury, impulsiveness, lability of mood, 
      inactivity and repetitive speech are characteristic behaviours in PWS in adult life. 
      Studies of the reasons for heterogeneity in behaviour are now needed.

TI  - Characterisation of an inverted X chromosome (p11.2q21.3) associated with mental 
      retardation using FISH.
PG  - 146-50
AB  - We report on a patient with a pericentric inversion of the X chromosome, 46,Y,inv(X) 
      (p11.2q21.3), who was referred for cytogenetic analysis because of mild mental 
      retardation, short stature, prepubescent macro-orchidism, and submucous cleft 
      palate. The same chromosomal abnormality was found in the proband's mother. The 
      inverted X chromosome was late replicating in all the mother's lymphocytes studied, 
      indicative of a likely unbalanced inversion. We show, by fluorescence in situ 
      hybridisation (FISH) using a panel of ordered yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) 
      clones, that the Xp breakpoint is localised in Xp11.23 between DXS146 and DXS255 and 
      that the Xq breakpoint is assigned to the X-Y homologous region in Xq21.3. YACs 
      crossing the Xp and Xq breakpoints have been identified. One of these two 
      breakpoints could be linked to the mental retardation in this patient as many 
      non-specific mental retardation (MRX) loci have previously been located in the 
      pericentromeric region of the X chromosome. Morever, the elucidation at the 
      molecular level of this rearrangement will also indicate if cleft palate or 
      prepubescent macro-orchidism, or both, in this boy are related to one of the two X 
      breakpoints.

AB  - Some children with Down syndrome may experience difficulties in recognizing facial 
      emotions, particularly fear, but it is not clear why, nor how such skills can best 
      be facilitated. Using a photo-matching task, emotion recognition was tested in 
      children with Down syndrome, children with nonspecific intellectual disability and 
      cognitively matched, typically developing children (all groups N = 21) under four 
      conditions: veridical vs. exaggerated emotions and emotion-labelling vs. generic 
      task instructions. In all groups, exaggerating emotions facilitated recognition 
      accuracy and speed, with emotion labelling facilitating recognition accuracy. 
      Overall accuracy and speed did not differ in the children with Down syndrome, 
      although recognition of fear was poorer than in the typically developing children 
      and unrelated to emotion label use. Implications for interventions are considered.

PG  - 250-3
AB  - Chromosome lesions which could be interpreted as "fragile sites" on the distal end 
      of the long arm of the X chromosome were identified during a cytogenetic study of 
      160 mentally retarded adult males with no apparent cause of their mental retardation 
      and one normal adult female with a family history of fra (X) syndrome. Peripheral 
      blood samples were cultured in either M199 or RPMI 1640 medium with FUdR or BrdU. 
      Metaphases were examined for chromosome lesions or fragile sites on the distal end 
      of Xq and 3 distinct sites were observed: Xq26, Xq27.2, and Xq27.3. Other chromosome 
      lesions at Xq28 were observed and interpreted as nonspecific telomeric structural 
      changes. Chromosome lesions were observed in cells from 14 of the 161 individuals. 
      These included: 5 patients with an Xq26 site, 2 with the recently reported Xq27.2 
      site, 4 with the Xq27.3 site (characteristic of the fra (X) syndrome), 2 with 
      nonspecific telomeric structural changes, and one individual with 2 lesions (a 
      nonspecific telomeric structural change and an Xq26 site). Additional research is 
      necessary to determine the frequency and clinical significance, if any, of lesions 
      occurring in this region of the X chromosome and to distinguish among heritable 
      fragile sites, constitutive fragile sites, and nonspecific telomeric structural 
      changes.

TI  - Adaptation of the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders in Spanish 
      with Nonspecific Intellectual Disability.

LID - 10.1007/s10578-020-00996-5 [doi]
AB  - Anxiety continues to be one of the most frequent disorders with typically developing 
      children and youth. However, people with intellectual disability (ID) lack validated 
      diagnostic tests backed by sufficient methodological rigor. Analyze the psychometric 
      properties of the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED) in 
      this clinical population, specifically in children and young Spanish with 
      Nonspecific Intellectual Disability. Descriptive statistics and item analysis 
      (N = 542), exploratory factorial analysis (n = 245) and confirmatory (n = 297) and 
      scale reliability analyses were performed and evaluated the internal consistency 
      with various indices (Cronbach's alpha and omega) and the stability of the 
      measurement (test-retest) of the resulting scale with better goodness-of-adjustment 
      indices. A new scale called SCARED-DI was obtained in this clinical sample with 
      three factors and a smaller number of items (22), offering important goodness-of-fit 
      indices (RMSEA [95% CI] 03[0.01; .04]; CFI = 0.99; TLI = 0.98; GFI = 0.88; 
      AGFI = 0.89) and high internal consistency (α = 0.91; ω = 0.93) and adequate 
      measurement stability (r(xx) = 0.92). The importance of validating 
      psychopathological anxiety tests for children and youth with ID in order to build 
      good mental health is discussed, emphasizing the need to provide easy, 
      short-duration tests on both cognitive and emotional aspects in this clinical 
      sub-population. In addition, the results are assessed in terms of future research 
      and practical implications. This new version of SCARED-ID represents a valid and 
      reliable tool to evaluate the anxiety in people with intellectual disabilities.

TI  - Fragile-X syndrome III: dermatoglyphic studies in males.
PG  - 195-207
AB  - Dermatoglyphics of 39 males with the fragile-X syndrome were compared with those of 
      3 groups of control subjects; 497 school boys, 15 males with non-specific mental 
      retardation, and 15 with Down syndrome. Compared with the control males, there was 
      an increased frequency of radial loops, whorls, and arches on the fingers and of 
      third interdigital patterns and abnormal creases on the hands, and a decreased 
      frequency of ulnar loops and fourth interdigital patterns in the patients with the 
      fragile-X syndrome. The mean a-b ridge count was lower than in controls and there 
      were more patients than controls with an a-b ridge count less than 70. All of these 
      differences were significant at p less than 0.01. There was no differences between 
      patients and controls with respect to total ridge count on the fingers and the 
      dermatoglyphics in other areas of the hands or feet. From this small study a 
      preliminary index was developed that attempts to distinguish male patients with the 
      fragile-X syndrome from normal male controls and males with non-fragile-X forms of 
      mental retardation. The patterns on the left and right third fingers, the a-b ridge 
      count, and the palmar creases were used in the index. Sixty-four % of patients with 
      the fragile-X syndrome would be selected out if greater than or equal to + 0.5 was 
      used as the criterion and 90% of these males would be expected to have the fragile-X 
      chromosome.

TI  - Hypomelanosis of Ito. Neurological complications in 34 cases.
PG  - 124-9
AB  - We studied 34 Spanish children with hypomelanosis of Ito. This disease has an 
      incidence of 1 per 1000 new patients consulting a paediatric neurological service, 
      or 1 per 8000-10,000 unselected patients in a children's hospital. About 94% of our 
      patients show noncutaneous abnormalities. Mental retardation (IQ below 70) was 
      present in 64.7%; another 14.7% had an IQ between 70 and 90, usually associated with 
      poor school performance. Four children exhibited autistic behaviour. Seizures of 
      various types were present in 53% of cases. Other skin alterations in addition to 
      the typical hypomelanosis were observed in 38% of our cases: café-au-lait spots, 
      angiomatous nevi, nevus marmorata, nevus of Ota, Mongolian blue spot, heterochromia 
      of the iris or hair, and other nonspecific pigmentations. Other associated disorders 
      occur inconsistently and include macrocephaly, microcephaly, hémihypertrophy, 
      kyphoscoliosis, coarse facial features, genital anomalies, inguinal hernia, 
      congenital heart disease, hypertelorism, and abnormalities of the teeth, feet and 
      eyes. Autosomal dominant inheritance is demonstrated in some but not all cases.

TI  - TBL1XR1 associated intellectual disability, a new missense variant with dysmorphic 
      features plus autism: Expanding the phenotypic spectrum.

LID - 10.1111/cge.13937 [doi]
AB  - Missense and frameshift pathogenic variants and microdeletions involving TBL1XR1 
      gene have been described in patients with intellectual disability, autism, Rett-like 
      features and schizophrenia, some of them with the clinical diagnosis of Pierpont 
      syndrome, a rare pattern of multiple congenital anomalies, but others without 
      dysmorphic findings or with non-specific ones, and also patients with only some of 
      the features associated with Pierpont syndrome. We here present a case with a de 
      novo novel missense variant in TBL1XR1 gene with overlapping features with Pierpont 
      syndrome and autism, a neurobehavioral manifestation not previously reported in 
      Pierpont syndrome. This patient expands the phenotypic spectrum of TBL1XR1 gene 
      pathogenic variants.

TI  - Linkage analysis suggests at least two loci for X-linked non-specific mental 
      retardation.
PG  - 473-83
AB  - Epidemiological studies have suggested that non-specific X-linked mental retardation 
      (XLMR) might be at least as frequent as the fragile X syndrome. The identification 
      of all mutations causing XLMR would thus appear of prime importance. In the absence 
      of other clinical signs the problem of genetic heterogeneity is acute. This can be 
      partly overcome by the analysis of large families. We have been able to perform 
      linkage analysis in 3 such families. The condition in family 1 was described as 
      clinically resembling the fra (X) syndrome by Proops et al [1983]: the kindred 
      includes 7 affected males in 3 sibships. Family 2 from Denmark has affected males in 
      4 generations; however, several affected relatives in this extended pedigree are 
      deceased. Family 3 from France counts 6 affected males in two sibships. The families 
      were analysed with about 25 X-linked markers. Linkage with markers in Xp22.2-p22.3 
      was found in family 1: z(theta) = 2.62 at theta = 0.06 for DXS85 (probe 782). 
      Suggestion of linkage was found in family 2 with both the Duchenne muscular 
      dystrophy region (DXS164 in Xp21.2) and with DXS1 (Xq11-q12). In family 3, DXS159 
      (Xq12-q13) gave a lod score of 2.53 at theta = 0; results were compatible with 
      localisation of the putative XLMR locus in this family proximal to DXYS1 (Xq21). 
      These data suggest that at least two non-specific XLMR loci could exist, one in Xp22 
      and the other in the q12-q13 region.

TI  - Prenatal and postnatal presentation of PRMT7 related syndrome: Expanding the 
      phenotypic manifestations.
PG  - 78-84
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.a.6 [doi]
AB  - Protein arginine methyltransferase 7 (PRMT7) is a member of a family of enzymes that 
      catalyze the transfer of methyl groups from S-adenosyl-l-methionine to nitrogen 
      atoms on arginine residues. Arginine methylation is involved in multiple biological 
      processes, such as signal transduction, mRNA splicing, transcriptional control, DNA 
      repair, and protein translocation. Currently, 10 patients have been described with 
      mutations in PRMT7. The shared findings include: hypotonia, intellectual disability, 
      short stature, brachydactyly, and mild dysmorphic features. We describe the 
      prenatal, postnatal, and pathological findings in two male sibs homozygote for a 
      mutation in PRMT7. Both had intrauterine growth restriction involving mainly the 
      long bones. In addition, eye tumor was found in the first patient, and nonspecific 
      brain calcifications and a systemic venous anomaly in the second. The pregnancy of 
      the first child was terminated and we describe the autopsy findings. The second 
      child had postnatal growth restriction of prenatal onset, hypotonia, strabismus, 
      sensorineural hearing loss, genitourinary and skeletal involvement, and global 
      developmental delay. He had dysmorphic features that included frontal bossing, 
      upslanting palpebral fissures, small nose with depressed nasal bridge, and pectus 
      excavatum. Our patients provide additional clinical and pathological data and expand 
      the phenotypic manifestations associated with PRMT7 homozygote/compound heterozygote 
      mutations to include brain calcifications and delayed myelination, and congenital 
      orbital tumor.

TI  - Can adolescents with Williams syndrome tell the difference between lies and jokes?
PG  - 85-103
AB  - A group of adolescents with Williams syndrome (WS) was compared to matched groups of 
      adolescents with Prader-Willi syndrome and nonspecific mental retardation on a task 
      that tested the ability to distinguish different forms of nonliteral language. 
      Participants listened to stories that ended in either a lie or an ironic joke. They 
      were asked to decide the form of the nonliteral utterance and justify their 
      responses. Almost none of the participants in any of the groups were able to 
      correctly classify the ironic jokes, instead judging them to be lies because they 
      did not correspond to reality. Their errors were similar to those made by younger 
      normally developing children, but contrasted with those made by brain-damaged 
      adults. These data are taken as further evidence that neurodevelopmental disorders 
      are quite different from acquired brain disorders and require different 
      neuropsychological models. The findings from this study also have important 
      implications for considering the difficulties that adolescents with WS and other 
      disorders will have in everyday social situations, especially among peers.

TI  - Dropped head syndrome in severe intractable epilepsies with mental retardation.
PG  - 282-7
AB  - PURPOSE: Dropped head syndrome is characterized by a gradual forward sagging of the 
      head due to the isolated weakness of the neck extensor muscles. The syndrome has a 
      relatively benign clinical course. To date, there have been no reports of dropped 
      head syndrome in epileptic patients. METHODS: Nine patients with intractable 
      epilepsy (mean age, 33.6+/-9.91 years), each presenting with apparent dropped head, 
      were evaluated. The duration of the drooping head symptom varied from 3 to 15 years 
      (mean, 7.4+/-4.06 years), with a slowly progressing weakness in most of the 
      patients. In all of the patients, extensive clinical, laboratory, 
      electrophysiological, histopathological, and neuroimaging examinations were 
      performed. RESULTS: The weakness in all of the subjects was strictly limited to the 
      cervical paraspinal muscles. Laboratory studies produced normal results from all 
      subjects. EMG and muscle biopsy were normal or revealed subtle nonspecific myopathic 
      changes without inflammation in the cervical paraspinal muscles. Polymyographic 
      investigation revealed that none of the patients had convincing dystonic spasms of 
      the anterior neck muscles. No atrophy or fatty changes of the neck extensor muscles 
      were observed on CT or MRI. In most of the patients (7/9), altered L-carnitine 
      concentrations were observed (four patients displayed a marked decrease in plasma 
      carnitine concentrations, and three other patients showed abnormalities in urinary 
      excretion of carnitine). CONCLUSIONS: These findings seem to suggest that a 
      secondary carnitine deficiency, induced by antiepileptic drugs (principally valproic 
      acid), represents a plausible pathogenetic mechanism for the development of dropped 
      head in some epileptic patients.

TI  - 10 years' experience in fragile X testing among mentally retarded individuals in 
      Greece: a molecular and epidemiological approach.
PG  - 451-5
AB  - Fragile X syndrome, the second most common genetic cause of mental retardation, is 
      due to the expansion of a trinucleotide repeat (CGG)n within the first exon of the 
      FMR-1 gene. Molecular genetic analysis provides accurate diagnosis and facilitates 
      genetic counselling and prenatal testing. Screening for the fragile X mutation in a 
      sample of 3,888 individuals in Greece is reported: 1,755 children with non-specific 
      mental retardation, 1,733 parents and other family members and 400 normal 
      individuals. Molecular analysis allowed for the identification and characterization 
      of 52 fragile X families confirming the clinical diagnosis in 57 males and 4 
      females. Sixty-six female carriers (6 mentally retarded) and 4 normal transmitting 
      males were also identified. Four severely retarded males and their mothers carried 
      unmethylated premutations, while a moderately retarded girl had a deletion of 
      approximately equal to 150 bp. Overall sizing of the CGG repeat produced an allele 
      distribution of 6-58 CGG repeats (mean 28-30), similar to that in other Caucasian 
      populations.

PG  - 620-4
AB  - Linkage studies and cytogenetically visible deletions associated with nonspecific 
      X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) and a specific form of deafness (DFN3) have 
      indicated that the genes responsible for these disorders are located at Xq21. Using 
      DNA probes from this region, we have studied several overlapping deletions spanning 
      different parts of Xq21. This has enabled us to assign the DFN3 gene and a gene for 
      nonspecific XLMR to an interval that encompasses the locus DXS232 and that is 
      flanked by DXS26 and DXS121.

TI  - Is autosomal recessive Silver-Russel syndrome a separate entity or is it part of the 
      3-M syndrome spectrum?
PG  - 1236-45
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.a.34009 [doi]
AB  - Intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) is a nonspecific finding that occurs in 
      approximately 0.17% of all live-births. However, IUGR can also be a significant 
      feature of many recognized genetic syndromes including Silver-Russel syndrome (SRS), 
      Three M syndrome (3-M), Dubowitz syndrome, and Mulibrey nanism. Differentiation of 
      3-M syndrome from autosomal recessive SRS has been difficult because of the 
      phenotypic variability of the latter. Limb length asymmetry is seen in over half of 
      those with autosomal recessive SRS, but not in individuals with 3-M syndrome. 
      Characteristic radiologic findings of 3-M syndrome are not present in SRS. We used 
      single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarrays to investigate the cause of 
      phenotypic features of SRS that shows autosomal recessive inheritance in three 
      consanguineous families, two from United Arab Emirates (UAE), and one from Jordan. 
      The mapped regions contained CUL7 and OBSL1, the genes that have recently been shown 
      to cause 3-M syndrome. Subsequently, direct DNA sequencing of CUL7 and OBSL1 genes 
      revealed novel mutations in both genes including two mutations in OBSL1 [c.1119G>C 
      (p.W373C) and c.681_682delinsTT (p.Q228X)], and a nonsense mutation in CUL7 
      [c.203G>A (p.W68X)]. In addition, a six nucleotide deletion in CUL7 
      [c.649_654delAGCCGC (p.217_218delSR)] was found in a consanguineous family from UAE 
      that had the typical features of 3-M. As a result of these findings, we question the 
      identity of the autosomal recessive SRS and suggest that all apparently recessive 
      SRS families should be tested for mutations in CUL7 and OBSL1.

PG  - 680-4
AB  - A 12-year-old female with developmental delay/mental retardation and a family 
      history of gynecologic cancers presented with nonspecific abdominal complaints and 
      was found to have a 4.5-kg, 25- x 23- x 15-cm pelvic mass with solid and cystic 
      components and associated retroperitoneal and mesenteric lymphadenopathy. Laboratory 
      studies revealed increased serum levels of CA-125 and inhibin B. Histologically, the 
      tumor exhibited several different morphologic appearances including adult granulosa 
      cell tumor, juvenile granulosa cell tumor (with areas of marked atypia), and Sertoli 
      cell tumor. Immunohistochemically, the tumor was positive for calretinin, MIC-2 
      (CD99), S100 protein, PGP 9.5, and neuron-specific enolase. Electron microscopy of 
      the Sertoli cell tumor-like areas showed Charcot-Bottcher filaments, a 
      distinguishing feature of Sertoli cells. Together, these findings supported a 
      diagnosis of mixed sex cord-stromal tumor including granulosa cell tumor of adult 
      and juvenile types and intermediate- to high-grade Sertoli cell tumor, with large 
      areas of markedly atypical sex cord-stromal tumor.

TI  - ATRX mutation in two adult brothers with non-specific moderate intellectual 
      disability identified by exome sequencing.
PG  - 102-8
LID - 10.1016/j.mgene.2013.09.004 [doi]
AB  - In this report, we describe two adult brothers affected by moderate non-specific 
      intellectual disability (ID). They showed minor facial anomalies, not clearly 
      ascribable to any specific syndromic patterns, microcephaly, brachydactyly and broad 
      toes. Both brothers presented seizures. Karyotype, subtelomeric and FMR1 analysis 
      were normal in both cases. We performed array-CGH analysis that revealed no 
      copy-number variations potentially associated with ID. Subsequent exome sequence 
      analysis allowed the identification of the ATRX c.109C>T (p.R37X) mutation in both 
      the affected brothers. Sanger sequencing confirmed the presence of the mutation in 
      the brothers and showed that the mother is a healthy carrier. Mutations in the ATRX 
      gene cause the X-linked alpha thalassemia/mental retardation (ATR-X) syndrome (MIM 
      #301040), a severe clinical condition usually associated with profound ID, facial 
      dysmorphism and alpha thalassemia. However, the syndrome is clinically heterogeneous 
      and some mutations, including the c.109C>T, are associated with a broad phenotypic 
      spectrum, with patients displaying a less severe phenotype with only mild-moderate 
      ID. In the case presented here, exome sequencing provided an effective strategy to 
      achieve the molecular diagnosis of ATR-X syndrome, which otherwise would have been 
      difficult to consider due to the mild non-specific phenotype and the absence of a 
      family history with typical severe cases.

TI  - Low frequency of MECP2 mutations in mentally retarded males.
PG  - 487-90
AB  - A high frequency of mutations in the methyl CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2) gene has 
      recently been reported in males with nonspecific X-linked mental retardation. The 
      results of this previous study suggested that the frequency of MECP2 mutations in 
      the mentally retarded population was comparable to that of CGG expansions in FMR1. 
      In view of these data, we performed MECP2 mutation analysis in a cohort of 475 
      mentally retarded males who were negative for FMR1 CGG repeat expansion. Five novel 
      changes, detected in seven patients, were predicted to change the MECP2 coding 
      sequence. Except for one, these changes were not found in a control population. 
      While this result appeared to suggest a high mutation rate, this conclusion was not 
      supported by segregation studies. Indeed, three of the five changes could be traced 
      in unaffected male family members. For another change, segregation analysis in the 
      family was not possible. Only one mutation, a frameshift created by a deletion of 
      two bases, was found to be de novo. This study clearly shows the importance of 
      segregation analysis for low frequency mutations, in order to distinguish them from 
      rare polymorphisms. The true frequency of MECP2 mutations in the mentally retarded 
      has probably been overestimated. Based on our data, the frequency of MECP2 mutations 
      in mentally retarded males is 0.2% (1/475).

TI  - Phonological short-term memory impairment and the word length effect in children 
      with intellectual disabilities.

LID - S0891-4222(13)00538-6 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.ridd.2013.11.025 [doi]
AB  - There is mounting evidence that children and adolescents with intellectual 
      disabilities (ID) of nonspecific aetiology perform poorer on phonological short-term 
      memory tasks than children matched for mental age indicating a structural deficit in 
      a process contributing to short-term recall of verbal material. One explanation is 
      that children with ID of nonspecific aetiology do not activate subvocal rehearsal to 
      refresh degrading memory traces. However, existing research concerning this 
      explanation is inconclusive since studies focussing on the word length effect (WLE) 
      as indicator of rehearsal have revealed inconsistent results for samples with ID and 
      because in several existing studies, it is unclear whether the WLE was caused by 
      rehearsal or merely appeared during output of the responses. We assumed that in 
      children with ID only output delays produce a small WLE while in typically 
      developing 6- to 8-year-olds rehearsal and output contribute to the WLE. From this 
      assumption we derived several predictions that were tested in an experiment 
      including 34 children with mild or borderline ID and 34 typically developing 
      children matched for mental age (MA). As predicted, results revealed a small but 
      significant WLE for children with ID that was significantly smaller than the WLE in 
      the control group. Additionally, for children with ID, a WLE was not found for the 
      first word of each trial but the effect emerged only in later serial positions. The 
      findings corroborate the notion that in children with ID subvocal rehearsal does not 
      develop in line with their mental age and provide a potential explanation for the 
      inconsistent results on the WLE in children with ID.

TI  - MECP2 mutations or polymorphisms in mentally retarded boys: diagnostic implications.
PG  - 3-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Among the well characterized X-linked conditions causing mental 
      retardation, mutations in the methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 gene (MECP2) in Xq28 have 
      been found in up to 85% of patients with Rett syndrome, a neurologic disorder which, 
      in addition to other symptoms, severely affects higher cognitive functions in 
      females. Mutations in the MECP2 gene are involved in a broad spectrum of phenotypes 
      from classical Rett syndrome to mild intellectual difficulties in females and 
      neonatal encephalopathy in males. Recently, mutations in the MECP2 gene were 
      reported in males with non-specific mental retardation suggesting that defects in 
      MECP2 could be responsible for up to 2% of X-linked mental retardation. METHODS: We 
      screened by denaturing high-pressure liquid chromatography the entire coding region 
      and flanking intronic sequences of the MECP2 gene in a cohort of 354 mentally 
      retarded males found negative for an expansion across the FRAXA CGG repeat and in a 
      family in which a boy and his sister were mentally retarded. RESULTS: We identified 
      mainly silent polymorphisms within the MECP2 gene, together with four sequence 
      alterations of unknown significance, i.e. three missense mutations (T197M, T228S, 
      and P376S) and one substitution at position -19 in intron 3 (378-19delT). Further 
      familial investigations allowed us to ruled out a pathogenic effect for the intronic 
      variant, the T228S and the P376S missense mutations. CONCLUSIONS: These results 
      confirm that MECP2 mutations in males are far more rare than initially thought and 
      call for a careful evaluation of the pathogenicity of the MECP2 missense mutations 
      identified in mentally retarded males before genetic counseling is proposed to the 
      relatives.

TI  - A systematic review of cognitive behavioural therapy for anxiety in adults with 
      intellectual disabilities.
PG  - 974-991
LID - 10.1111/jir.12548 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anxiety disorders have high prevalence in people with intellectual 
      disabilities. In populations without intellectual disabilities, cognitive 
      behavioural therapy is a first line psychological therapy for these presentations. 
      There is no existing review of the range of methods and outcomes from intervention 
      studies in this area. METHOD: A systematic review was carried out following guidance 
      in the Cochrane handbook for systematic reviews of interventions. RESULTS: Nineteen 
      studies were identified. The majority of reports were descriptive case studies; the 
      most frequently described presentations were non-specific anxiety disorders and 
      post-traumatic stress disorder; the most frequently described cognitive techniques 
      were psycho-education and interventions directly aimed at thoughts and beliefs and 
      most studies reported positive outcomes, although the better controlled studies 
      tended to report less comprehensive impacts. CONCLUSIONS: A range of presentations 
      have been described although the area is still at a primarily descriptive stage. We 
      discuss intervention structures and approaches that require further research.

TI  - Refining diagnoses: applying the DC-LD to an Irish population with intellectual 
      disability.
PG  - 813-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: The diagnostic criteria for psychiatric disorders for use with adults 
      with learning disabilities/mental retardation (DC-LD) is a diagnostic tool developed 
      in 2001 to improve upon existing classification systems for adults with learning 
      disability. The aim of this study was to apply the classification system described 
      by the DC-LD to a residential intellectual disability (ID) population to examine 
      whether it improved our diagnostic understanding of residents. METHODS: Chart 
      reviews of 113 of 178 people in a residential ID service were conducted. For each 
      resident, information was recorded according to the DC-LD multi-axial system. Each 
      resident's case was then discussed with a member of nursing staff familiar with the 
      resident. If diagnosis was unclear, the case was discussed with a senior clinical 
      psychiatrist. RESULTS: The percentage of residents with a moderate to profound ID 
      was 87.6%. In total, 94 diagnoses of psychiatric illness (Axis III, Level B, DC-LD) 
      were made. Of those 94 diagnoses, seven new diagnoses were found because of DC-LD 
      criteria. Of the total number of psychiatric diagnoses made, 72.3% were 
      non-specific, residual category diagnoses. A total of 79 residents (69.9%) had at 
      least one behaviour problem diagnosed on Axis III, Level D, Problem behaviours. 
      Fifty-six (49.6%) of residents in this sample had co-morbid epilepsy. CONCLUSIONS: 
      In people with moderate to profound learning disabilities, diagnosis continues to be 
      challenging. The DC-LD is a useful tool in helping to clarify diagnoses in this 
      population by providing revised criteria and a system to classify problem 
      behaviours. The DC-LD would be more helpful if specific axes were included to 
      document medical and psychosocial problems independently from other diagnoses. 
      Further research is warranted to determine whether the DC-LD hierarchical approach 
      to diagnosis improves diagnostic validity.

TI  - [Anassociation study between OPHN1 gene rs492933 polymorphism and mental retardation 
      in children of the Qinba Mountain region.].
PG  - 1307-11
AB  - The OPHN1 gene encodes a Rho-GTPase activating protein (RhoGAP), and mutations in 
      OPHN1 are responsible for non-specific X-linked mental retardation (NSMR). A SNP 
      located in the 5'-untranslated region (UTRs) of OPHN1 (rs492933) was examined by 
      PCR-RFLP to assess its contribution to cognitive ability in 234 unrelated healthy 
      and MR children in the Qinba Mountain region in Shaanxi. The allelic frequencies of 
      rs492933 were 0.826 for the C allele and 0.174 for the T allele. Genotype 
      frequencies and allelic frequencies were not significantly different between the MR 
      and the controls, or between the borderline group and the controls. In conclusion, 
      there is no association between the OPHN1 gene polymorphism and NSMR in the Qinba 
      Mountain region children.

TI  - Detection of the fragile X syndrome protein for the evaluation of FMR1 intermediate 
      alleles.
PG  - 195-6
AB  - Molecular screening programs in mentally retarded individuals have been performed in 
      several populations worldwide. One finding has been an excess of FMR1 intermediate 
      alleles in a population with learning difficulties. However, other published reports 
      with similar characteristics did not corroborate those previous results. In order to 
      contribute additional data from our population, we studied 563 patients affected 
      with nonspecific mental retardation (MRX) that did not present a CGG expansion in 
      the FMR1 gene and 208 individuals as a control population. Forty MRX patients 
      presented alleles within the intermediate range. Among them, one case showed a 
      pattern of expression of the FMR1 protein (FMRP) concordant with a fragile X 
      syndrome case with an intermediate allele/full mutation mosaicism, although it was 
      not detected by Southern blot analysis. Statistical analysis was performed again 
      showing no statistically significant difference regarding the intermediate allele 
      frequency in the MRX and control populations. This finding is in agreement with the 
      hypothesis that the incidence of intermediate FMR1 alleles in MRX populations does 
      not seem to be higher than in control populations, and it emphasizes the importance 
      of FMRP detection as a diagnostic tool for fragile X syndrome.

PG  - 283-7
AB  - Two families with nonspecific X-linked mental retardation (MRX) are presented. In 
      the first family, MRX51, three male patients showed mild to borderline mental 
      retardation. Multipoint linkage analysis yielded a maximal LOD score of 2.10 between 
      markers DXS8012 and DXS1003, localizing the MRX51 gene at Xp11.3-p11.23. In the 
      second family, XLMR7, three men showed moderate mental retardation (MR), and one 
      possible female carrier had mild MR. Multipoint linkage analysis yielded an LOD 
      score of 1.80 between markers DXS8063 and DXS1047, situating the disease gene at 
      Xq23-q26.1. When the analysis was performed considering the affected female to be an 
      expressing heterozygote carrier of the disease mutation, a maximal LOD score of 2.10 
      was found in the same region.

TI  - Identification of the gene FMR2, associated with FRAXE mental retardation.
PG  - 105-8
AB  - Five folate-sensitive fragile sites have been characterized at the molecular level 
      (FRAXA, FRAXE, FRAXF, FRA16A and FRA11B). Three of them (FRAXA, FRAXE and FRA11B) 
      are associated with clinical problems, and two of the genes (FMR1 in FRAXA and CBL2 
      in FRA11B) have been identified. All of these fragile sites are associated with 
      (CCG)n/(CGG)n triplet expansions which are hypermethylated beyond a critical size. 
      FRAXE is a rare folate sensitive fragile site only recently recognized. Its 
      cytogenetic expression was found to involve the amplification of a (CCG)n repeat 
      adjacent to a CpG island. Normal alleles vary from 6 to 25 copies. Expansions of 
      greater than 200 copies were found in FRAXE expressing males and their FRAXE 
      associated CpG island was fully methylated. An association of FRAXE expression with 
      concurrent methylation of the CpG island and mild non-specific mental handicap in 
      males has been reported by several groups. We now report the cloning and 
      characterization of a gene (FMR2) adjacent to FRAXE. Elements of FMR2 were initially 
      identified from sequences deleted from a developmentally delayed boy. We correlate 
      loss of FMR2 expression with (CCG)n expansion at FRAXE, demonstrating that this is a 
      gene associated with the CpG island adjacent to FRAXE and contributes for 
      FRAXE-associated mild mental retardation.

AB  - The teaching of imitation skills is often the first step in interventions for young 
      learners with intellectual disabilities. The main goal of this study was to 
      determine the smallest detectable difference (SDD) at 95% confidence of the 
      Preschool Imitation and Praxis Scale (PIPS) in preschoolers with intellectual 
      disabilities. Two raters independently scored videotapes of the imitation 
      performance of 44 preschoolers (27 with Down syndrome, 10 with Non-Specific Mental 
      Retardation and 7 with Low-functioning Autism) between 13 and 58 months of age (mean 
      age 39.6 months, SD 11.9 months). Results revealed that the PIPS demonstrated 
      acceptable interrater reliability on item level (weighted kappa values ranged from 
      0.52 to 0.96) and scale level (ICC = 0.986; 95% CI: 0.975-0.993). The SDD of the 
      PIPS was 7.2%, indicating that the change score rated by different raters for an 
      individual child with an intellectual disability is valid and that the PIPS can be 
      used by early interventionists and researchers as an outcome measure to determine 
      children's maturation or improvement.

LID - 10.1002/ajmg.a.38019 [doi]
AB  - There is a significant level of genetic heterogeneity underlying the phenotype of 
      nonspecific hypotonia with severe intellectual disability. Exome sequencing has 
      proven to be a powerful tool for identifying the underlying molecular basis of such 
      nonspecific, abnormal neurological phenotypes. Mutations in the TBCK gene have been 
      reported associated with very poor, if any, psychomotor development, poor speech, 
      and inability to walk independently. We describe the long-term phenotypic evolution 
      of a severe nonspecific neurodevelopmental disorder in two siblings born to an 
      Arab-Moslem family living in northern Israel. Exome sequencing led to identification 
      of a novel homozygous mutation: c.1854delT in the TBCK gene. Abnormal elevated β-HCG 
      was found in the maternal serum during the two pregnancies, a finding that has not 
      been reported before. These individuals present with severe intellectual disability, 
      no speech, hypotonia, convulsions, and lack of any independent daily skills. © 2016

TI  - A genotype-first approach for the molecular and clinical characterization of 
      uncommon de novo microdeletion of 20q13.33.
PG  - e12462
LID - e12462 [pii]
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0012462 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Subtelomeric deletions of the long arm of chromosome 20 are rare, with 
      only 11 described in the literature. Clinical features of individuals with these 
      microdeletions include severe limb malformations, skeletal abnormalities, growth 
      retardation, developmental and speech delay, mental retardation, seizures and mild, 
      non-specific dysmorphic features. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We characterized 
      microdeletions at 20q13.33 in six individuals referred for genetic evaluation of 
      developmental delay, mental retardation, and/or congenital anomalies. A comparison 
      to previously reported cases of 20q13.33 microdeletion shows phenotypic overlap, 
      with clinical features that include mental retardation, developmental delay, speech 
      and language deficits, seizures, and behavior problems such as autistic spectrum 
      disorder. There does not appear to be a clinically recognizable constellation of 
      dysmorphic features among individuals with subtelomeric 20q microdeletions. 
      CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Based on genotype-phenotype correlation among individuals 
      in this and previous studies, we discuss several possible candidate genes for 
      specific clinical features, including ARFGAP1, CHRNA4 and KCNQ2 and 
      neurodevelopmental deficits. Deletion of this region may play an important role in 
      cognitive development.

TI  - The RhoGAP activity of OPHN1, a new F-actin-binding protein, is negatively 
      controlled by its amino-terminal domain.
PG  - 574-86
AB  - Recent human genetic approaches showed that mutations in three genes encoding OPHN1, 
      PAK3, and alphaPIX cause nonspecific X-linked mental retardation. These three 
      proteins act to modulate Rho GTPase signaling pathways and may participate in 
      neuronal morphogenesis by regulating the actin cytoskeleton. Here we showed that the 
      Oligophrenin-1 gene is expressed in the developing spinal cord and later in brain 
      areas that are characterized by high synaptic plasticity. At the cellular level 
      OPHN1 is expressed in both glial and neuronal cells where it colocalizes with actin, 
      notably at the tip of growing neurites. This interaction seems to be direct through 
      a novel uncharacterized domain in the carboxyl-terminal end of OPHN1. Overexpression 
      experiments in fibroblasts showed that the OPHN1 RhoGAP domain regulates in vivo the 
      actin cytoskeleton by inhibition of Rho pathways. Interestingly the amino-terminal 
      domain of OPHN1 inhibits the RhoGAP activity through an as yet unknown mechanism, 
      suggesting that OPHN1 may be tightly regulated in vivo.

AB  - Mutations in more than 500 genes have been associated with intellectual disability 
      (ID) and related disorders of cognitive function, such as autism and schizophrenia. 
      Here we aimed to unravel the molecular epidemiology of non-specific ID in a genetic 
      isolate using a combination of population and molecular genetic approaches. A large 
      multigenerational pedigree was ascertained within a Dagestan Genetic Heritage 
      research program in a genetic isolate of indigenous ethnics. Clinical 
      characteristics of the affected members were based on combining diagnoses from 
      regional psychiatric hospitals with our own clinical assessment, using a Russian 
      translation of the structured psychiatric interviews, the Diagnostic Interview for 
      Genetic Studies and the Family Interview for Genetic Studies, based on DSM-IV 
      criteria. Weber/CHLC 9.0 STRs set was used for multipoint parametric linkage 
      analyses (Simwalk2.91). Next, we checked CNVs and LOH (based on Affymetrix SNP 5.0 
      data) in the linked with ID genomic regions with the aim to identify candidate genes 
      associated with mutations in linked regions. The number of statistically significant 
      (p ≤ 0.05) suggestive linkage peaks with 1.3 < LOD < 3.0 we detected in a total of 
      10 genomic regions: 1q41, 2p25.3-p24.2, 3p13-p12.1, 4q13.3, 10p11, 11q23, 
      12q24.22-q24.31, 17q24.2-q25.1, 21q22.13 and 22q12.3-q13.1. Three significant 
      linkage signals with LOD >3 were obtained at 2p25.3-p24.2 under the dominant model, 
      with a peak at 21 cM flanked by loci D2S2976 and D2S2952; at 12q24.22-q24.31 under 
      the recessive model, with a peak at -120 cM flanked by marker D12S2070 and D12S395 
      and at 22q12.3 under the dominant model, with a peak at 32 cM flanked by marker 
      D22S683 and D22S445. After a set of genes had been designated as possible candidates 
      in these specific chromosomal regions,we conducted an exploratory search for LOH and 
      CNV based on microarray data to detect structural genomic variants within five 
      ID-linked regions with LOD scores between 2.0 and 3.9. In these selected regions we 
      obtained 173 ROH segments and 98 CN segments. Further analysis of region 
      2p25.3-p24.2 revealed deletions within genes encoding MYTL, SNTG2 and TPO among five 
      of 21 affected cases at 2p25.3-p24.2. In the ID-linked region at 12q24.22-12q24.31 
      19 out of 21 ID cases carried segmental CNV and 20 of 21 them displayed ROH segments 
      with mean size lengths for ID cases 2512 kb (500-6,472 kb) and for healthy control 
      682 kb (531-986 kb), including the genes MED13L, HRK, FBXW8, TESC, CDK2AP1 and 
      SBNO1. Seven of 21 affected pedigree members displayed segmental deletions at 
      22q12.3 that includes the gene LARGE. Eight affected pedigree members carried ROH 
      segments and 6 CN segments at 10p11.23-p11.21 containing the genes ZEB1, c10orf68 
      and EPC1. Our linkage and structural genomic variation analyses in a remote highland 
      genetic isolate with aggregation of ID demonstrated that even highly isolated single 
      kindred ID has oligo/polygenic pathogenesis. The results obtained implicate 10 
      genomic regions linked with ID that contain some of previously reported candidate 
      genes, including HRK, FBXW8, TESC, CDK2AP1 and SBNO1 at 12q24 that were shown in 
      recent studies as associated with brain measures derived from MRI scans.

AB  - This study is the first to investigate the effectiveness of deep and shallow 
      intervention programs in the acquisition of visual metaphor comprehension in 
      individuals with non-specific intellectual disability (NSID; aged 15-59, N = 53) or 
      Down syndrome (DS; aged 15-52, N = 50). The deep intervention program was based on 
      dynamic assessment model for enhancing analogical thinking. The shallow intervention 
      program involves memorizing a metaphorical relationship between pairs of pictures. 
      Visual metaphor comprehension was measured by the construction of a metaphorical 
      connection between pairs of pictures. The results indicated that both etiology 
      groups exhibited poor understanding of visual metaphors before the intervention. A 
      significant improvement was observed in both interventions and both etiology groups, 
      with greater improvement among individuals who underwent the deep processing. 
      Moreover, the latter procedure led to greater generalization ability. The results 
      also indicated that vocabulary contributed significantly to understanding unstudied 
      metaphors and that participants with poorer linguistic abilities exhibited greater 
      improvement in their metaphorical thinking. Thus, individuals with ID with or 
      without DS are able to recruit the higher-order cognitive abilities required for 
      visual metaphor comprehension.

TI  - Prenatal exposure to influenza epidemics and risk of mental retardation.
PG  - 255-9
AB  - This study was undertaken to determine whether prenatal exposure to influenza 
      epidemics increases the risk of mental handicap. The monthly birth frequencies of 
      827 first-admission individuals (mean age at admission 13 years) with a primary 
      diagnosis of non-specific mental retardation, discharged from psychiatric hospitals 
      in England and Wales, were examined in relation to the monthly death rates from 
      influenza over the period 1953-1980. The relative risk of developing mental handicap 
      when exposed to influenza epidemics during mid-gestation was assessed by a 
      generalized linear model. Increased death rates from influenza, a measure of 
      prevalence of the infection, were significantly associated with an increase in 
      births of mentally handicapped individuals 6 months later. For every 1000 female 
      deaths from influenza there was a 17% increase in births of mentally handicapped 
      individuals 6 months later. Maternal exposure to influenza at approximately the 
      third to fourth month of gestation may be risk factor for developing mental 
      handicap.

TI  - Inv(X)(p21.1;q22.1) in a man with mental retardation, short stature, general muscle 
      wasting, and facial dysmorphism: clinical study and mutation analysis of the NXF5 
      gene.
PG  - 367-74
AB  - We describe a 59-year-old male (patient A059) with moderate to severe mental 
      retardation (MR) and a pericentric inversion of the X-chromosome: 
      inv(X)(p21.1;q22.1). He had short stature, pectus excavatum, general muscle wasting, 
      and facial dysmorphism. Until now, no other patients with similar clinical features 
      have been described in the literature. Molecular analysis of both breakpoints led to 
      the identification of a novel "Nuclear RNA export factor" (NXF) gene cluster on 
      Xq22.1. Within this cluster, the NXF5 gene was interrupted with subsequent loss of 
      gene expression. Hence, mutation analysis of the NXF5 and its neighboring homologue, 
      the NXF2 gene was performed in 45 men with various forms of syndromic X-linked MR 
      (XLMR) and in 70 patients with nonspecific XLMR. In the NXF5 gene four nucleotide 
      changes: one intronic, two silent, and one missense (K23E), were identified. In the 
      NXF2 gene two changes (one intronic and one silent) were found. Although none of 
      these changes were causative mutations, we propose that NXF5 is a good candidate 
      gene for this syndromic form of XLMR, given the suspected role of NXF proteins is 
      within mRNA export/transport in neurons. Therefore, mutation screening of the NXF 
      gene family in phenotypically identical patients is recommended.

TI  - A familial contiguous gene deletion syndrome at Xp22.3 characterized by severe 
      learning disabilities and ADHD.
PG  - 139-47
AB  - We describe a mother and two sons with a 6-Mb terminal deletion of the short arm of 
      the X chromosome. The breakpoint was localized to a region between DXS6837 and 
      sAJ243947 in Xp22.33. The two boys were shown to be deleted for the SHOX and ARSE 
      genes on their X chromosome. Both sons were short in stature and showed mild to 
      moderate skeletal abnormalities. The most significant findings in the younger son 
      were severe learning disabilities and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder 
      (ADHD). The older son tested in the mild mental retardation range and was also 
      affected by ADHD. The VCX-A gene, implicated recently in X-linked nonspecific mental 
      retardation, was found to be present in both boys. The mother's stature was greater 
      than one standard deviation below her target height and she had only subtle 
      radiographic evidence of Madelung deformity. Our findings indicate that loss of the 
      Xp22.3 region is not always associated with the classic presentations of Léri-Weill 
      syndrome, or chondrodysplasia punctata, and that one or more genes involved in 
      learning and attention may reside in Xp22.3.

PG  - 46-54
LID - 10.1192/bjp.bp.113.132324 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Children with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS) have been reported 
      to have high rates of cognitive and psychiatric problems. AIMS: To establish the 
      nature and prevalence of psychiatric disorder and neurocognitive impairment in 
      children with 22q11.2DS and test whether risk of psychopathology is mediated by the 
      children's intellectual impairment. METHOD: Neurocognition and psychopathology were 
      assessed in 80 children with 22q11.2DS (mean age 10.2 years, s.d. = 2.1) and 39 
      sibling controls (mean age 10.9 years, s.d. = 2.0). RESULTS: More than half (54%) of 
      children with 22q11.2DS met diagnostic criteria for one or more DSM-IV-TR 
      psychiatric disorder. These children had lower IQ (mean 76.8, s.d. = 13.0) than 
      controls (mean 108.6, s.d. = 15.2) (P<0.001) and showed a range of neurocognitive 
      impairments. Increased risk of psychopathology was not mediated by intellectual 
      impairment. CONCLUSIONS: 22q11.2DS is not related to a specific psychiatric 
      phenotype in children. Moreover, the deletion has largely independent effects on IQ 
      and risk of psychopathology, indicating that psychopathology in 22q11.2DS is not a 
      non-specific consequence of generalised cognitive impairment.

TI  - Computerized approach to X-linked mental retardation syndromes.
PG  - 190-9
AB  - Photographs of normal and abnormal relatives with X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) 
      and clinical data are combined in a Macintosh II computer system to provide an 
      objective and versatile means of evaluating developmental abnormalities. The system 
      includes a flatbed scanner for the entry of photographs and text, additional memory 
      to enhance resolution of photographs, and several programs which facilitate searches 
      for keywords. The primary advantages of the system include an easy interaction 
      between descriptive words and photographs, and rapid comparison of whole faces and 
      specific traits from many individuals. Information within families and between 
      disorders can easily be compared in coded or uncoded fashion. Data from the 34 
      currently described syndromes emerging from the category of "non-specific XLMR" are 
      being used to develop and test this approach. Neither standard photographs nor most 
      computerized diagnostic systems permit this flexibility. Ultimately, this approach 
      will provide a valuable diagnostic and teaching aid.

TI  - Deletion mapping and X inactivation analysis of a non-specific mental retardation 
      gene at Xp21.3-Xp22.11.
PG  - 187-91
AB  - We report on deletion mapping and X inactivation analysis of a gene for X linked 
      non-specific mental retardation (MRX) at Xp21.3-Xp22.11, on the basis of molecular 
      studies in two families with Xp microdeletions involving the DAX-1 gene. In family 
      A, mental retardation (MR) was profound in the older brother with an episode of 
      adrenal crisis, severe in the younger brother with no episode of adrenal crisis, and 
      mild to moderate in the sister and the mother with no signs of adrenal hypoplasia. 
      In family B, MR was absent in the male patient with adrenal hypoplasia. Polymerase 
      chain reaction for 16 loci in the middle of Xp showed that the brothers of family A 
      had a small Xp deletion between DXS7182 and DXS1022, and that the patient of family 
      B had a tiny Xp deletion between DXS319 and DXS1022. Microsatellite analysis for 
      tetranucleotide repeats in the promoter region of the DAX-1 gene and Southern 
      blotting for DAX-1 and DXS28 showed that the sister and the mother of family A were 
      heterozygous for the interstitial deletion. X inactivation analysis for the 
      methylation status of the AR gene and the HPRT gene indicated that the normal X and 
      the deleted X chromosome underwent random X inactivation in both the sister and the 
      mother. The results imply that an MRX gene subject to X inactivation is present in a 
      roughly 4 Mb region between DXS7182 and DAX-1, and that reduced expression of the 
      normal MRX gene caused by random X inactivation results in MR in carrier females.

TI  - Phenotypic expansion in Zhu-Tokita-Takenouchi-Kim syndrome caused by de novo 
      variants in the SON gene.
PG  - e1432
LID - 10.1002/mgg3.1432 [doi]
LID - e1432
AB  - BACKGROUND: The genetic etiology of intellectual and psychomotor disability without 
      a defined spectrum of dysmorphic features is usually monogenic. As no diagnostic 
      criteria for such diseases are established, the clinical diagnosis becomes to be a 
      challenge. The object of our paper is to present two patients with non-specific 
      clinical symptoms for whom whole-exome-sequencing identified the new SON mutations 
      and thus allowed for establishing the diagnosis of Zhu-Tokita-Takenouchi-Kim (ZTTK) 
      syndrome. In both patients, the same symptoms including hypotonia, developmental and 
      speech delay, feeding difficulties as well as frequent infections of the respiratory 
      tract and internal ear were observed. However, both cases presented also with 
      exceptional symptoms such as in case 1 ventriculomegaly and asymmetry of ventricles, 
      hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS), intellectual disability, intestinal 
      malrotation, gastroparesis, and duodenal atresia and in the case 2 febrile seizures 
      and reduced IgA levels. We will be presenting the patients and comparing them to 30 
      previously described cases. METHODS: Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed on 
      the probands' DNA and paired-end sequenced (2x100 bp) on HiSeq 1500. Variants 
      considered as disease-causing were validated in the proband and studied in all 
      available family members by amplicon deep sequencing performed using Nextera XT Kit 
      and sequenced on HiSeq 1500. RESULTS: We have identified two new variants in SON 
      gene. In case 1 it has been a heterozygous frameshift variant p.(Ala1340GlnfsTer26), 
      while in case 2 it has been a heterozygous frameshift variant, p.(Asp1640GlyfsTer7). 
      Both variants are described for the first time and up to now, are not mentioned in 
      any database. CONCLUSION: As there are no precise criteria established for the 
      clinical diagnosis of ZTTK, an identification of SON gene mutation by 
      whole-exome-sequencing is the best method that allows for a diagnosis of this 
      syndrome.

TI  - Cognitive impairment in Gdi1-deficient mice is associated with altered synaptic 
      vesicle pools and short-term synaptic plasticity, and can be corrected by 
      appropriate learning training.
PG  - 105-17
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddn321 [doi]
AB  - The GDI1 gene, responsible in human for X-linked non-specific mental retardation, 
      encodes alphaGDI, a regulatory protein common to all GTPases of the Rab family. Its 
      alteration, leading to membrane accumulation of different Rab GTPases, may affect 
      multiple steps in neuronal intracellular traffic. Using electron microscopy and 
      electrophysiology, we now report that lack of alphaGDI impairs several steps in 
      synaptic vesicle (SV) biogenesis and recycling in the hippocampus. Alteration of the 
      SV reserve pool (RP) and a 50% reduction in the total number of SV in adult synapses 
      may be dependent on a defective endosomal-dependent recycling and may lead to the 
      observed alterations in short-term plasticity. As predicted by the synaptic 
      characteristics of the mutant mice, the short-term memory deficit, observed when 
      using fear-conditioning protocols with short intervals between trials, disappeared 
      when the Gdi1 mutants were allowed to have longer intervals between sessions. 
      Likewise, previously observed deficits in radial maze learning could be corrected by 
      providing less challenging pre-training. This implies that an intact RP of SVs is 
      necessary for memory processing under challenging conditions in mice. The 
      possibility to correct the learning deficit in mice may have clinical implication 
      for future studies in human.

TI  - CALL interrupted in a patient with non-specific mental retardation: gene 
      dosage-dependent alteration of murine brain development and behavior.
PG  - 1463-74
AB  - Investigation of MR patients with 3p aberrations led to the identification of the 
      translocation breakpoint in intron five of the neural Cell Adhesion L1-Like (CALL or 
      CHL1) gene in a man with non-specific mental retardation and 46,Y, 
      t(X;3)(p22.1;p26.3). The Xp breakpoint does not seem to affect a known or predicted 
      gene. Moreover, a fusion transcript with the CALL gene could not be detected and no 
      mutations were identified on the second allele. CALL is highly expressed in the 
      central and peripheral nervous system, like the mouse ortholog 'close homolog to L1' 
      (Chl1). Chl1 expression levels in the hippocampus of Chl1(+/-) mice were half of 
      those obtained in wild-type littermates, reflecting a gene dosage effect. Timm 
      staining and synaptophysin immunohistochemistry of the hippocampus showed focal 
      groups of ectopic mossy fiber synapses in the lateral CA3 region, outside the 
      trajectory of the infra-pyramidal mossy fiber bundle in Chl1(-/-) and Chl1(+/-) 
      mice. Behavioral assessment demonstrated mild alterations in the Chl1(-/-) animals. 
      In the probe trial of the Morris Water Maze test, Chl1(-/-) mice displayed an 
      altered exploratory pattern. In addition, these mice were significantly more 
      sociable and less aggressive as demonstrated in social exploration tests. The 
      Chl1(+/-) mice showed a phenotypic spectrum ranging from wild-type to knockout 
      behavior. We hypothesize that a 50% reduction of CALL expression in the developing 
      brain results in cognitive deficits. This suggests that the CALL gene at 3p26.3 is a 
      prime candidate for an autosomal form of mental retardation. So far, mutation 
      analysis of the CALL gene in patients with non-specific MR did not reveal any 
      disease-associated mutations.

TI  - Two unrelated patients with inversions of the X chromosome and non-specific mental 
      retardation: physical and transcriptional mapping of their common breakpoint region 
      in Xq13.1.
PG  - 754-8
AB  - Two unrelated mildly retarded males with inversions of the X chromosome and 
      non-specific mental retardation (MRX) are described. Case 1 has a pericentric 
      inversion 46,Y,inv(X) (p11.1q13.1) and case 2 a paracentric inversion 46,Y,inv(X) 
      (q13.1q28). Both male patients have severe learning difficulties. The same 
      chromosomal abnormalities were found in their mothers who are intellectually normal. 
      Fluorescence in situ hybridisation mapping showed a common area of breakage of each 
      of the inverted chromosomes in Xq13.1 near DXS131 and DXS162. A detailed long range 
      restriction map of the breakpoint region was constructed using YAC, PAC, and cosmid 
      clones. We show that the two inverted chromosomes break within a short 250 kb 
      region. Moreover, a group of ESTs corresponding to an as yet uncharacterised gene 
      was mapped to the same critical interval. We hypothesise that the common inversion 
      breakpoint region of the two cases in Xq13.1 may contain a new MRX gene.

TI  - De novo mutations of TUBB2A cause infantile-onset epilepsy and developmental delay.
PG  - 601-608
LID - 10.1038/s10038-020-0739-5 [doi]
AB  - We analyzed our two new cases of infantile-onset epilepsy with developmental delay 
      with de novo variant in TUBB2A and review the related literatures. Our two probands 
      were both girls with infantile-onset epilepsy and global developmental delay. Case 1 
      had a novel de novo heterozygous missense variant: c.728C>T [p.Pro243Leu] 
      (NM_001069.2). Her brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed nonspecific white 
      matter myelination delay and slightly enlarged anterior horn of lateral ventricle. 
      Her epilepsy had been controlled by TPM monotherapy. Case 2 had a reported de novo 
      variant c.743C>T [p.Ala248Val] (NM_001069.2). Her brain MRI showed bilateral 
      microgyria and corpus callosum dysplasia. A total of seven TUBB2A mutations cases 
      had been published previously in five papers, therefore, until now, there were nine 
      patients with TUBB2A mutations. All patients had developmental delay, among them 
      seven cases also with infantile-onset epilepsy, one case with abnormal EEG but 
      without clinical seizures. There are six cases that have different degree of 
      cortical dysplasia, one case with cerebellar vermis atrophy and brainstem 
      sacsinopathy, the rest two cases have no obvious brain structural abnormalities. 
      There was one case with variant c.1249G>A (p.D417N) that had atypical clinical 
      presentation, including prominent progressive spastic ataxia, sensory motor axonal 
      neuropathy, and bilateral optic macular dystrophy, but relatively mild intellectual 
      disability, his MRI showed cerebellar atrophy, thinning of the corpus callosum and 
      pons sacsinopathy, but no cortical malformation. The p.A248V mutation was the most 
      common mutation occurred in three patients (3/9). The clinical phenotypes of these 
      three patients were similar, all of them had global developmental delay with no 
      language and corpus callosum dysplasia, two cases with epilepsy and the other one 
      only have EEG epileptic discharges without clinical seizure, two cases with cortical 
      dysplasia and the other one without obvious brain malformation. In brief, global 
      developmental delay was the most common phenotype of TUBB2A mutation-related 
      disease, most cases also had infantile-onset epilepsy and cortical dysplasia and 
      corpus callosum dysplasia. The region between seventh and eighth alpha-helix of 
      TUBB2A may be a "hot spot" mutation domain.

TI  - Fragile X syndrome is less common than previously estimated.
PG  - 1-5
AB  - In 1986, a population study of school children in the city of Coventry gave an 
      overall prevalence in males and females for fragile X syndrome of 1/952. The 29 
      children diagnosed as having fragile X syndrome in this study have been re-evaluated 
      with molecular diagnostic techniques. Eighteen of the original 29 children have been 
      found not to have the expansion of the FMR1 gene associated with fragile X syndrome. 
      Revised prevalence figures have been calculated giving rise to an overall prevalence 
      figure of 1/2720 (range 1/2198-1/3089). If the four children lost to follow up are 
      also assumed not to have the fragile X syndrome, the revised prevalence figure was 
      1/5714 (range 1/4762-1/6349). Clinical review of boys with severe mental retardation 
      from this and a subsidiary study show that the clinical features of head 
      circumference greater than the 50th centile, testicular volume greater than the 50th 
      centile, and IQ between 35 and 70 remain helpful in distinguishing boys with fragile 
      X syndrome from those who have non-specific mental retardation.

TI  - Intellectual disability without epilepsy associated with STXBP1 disruption.
PG  - 607-9
LID - 10.1038/ejhg.2010.183 [doi]
AB  - STXBP1 (Munc18-1) is a component of the machinery involved in the fusion of 
      secretory vesicles to the presynaptic membrane for the release of neurotransmitters. 
      De novo missense mutations in STXBP1 were recently reported in patients with 
      Ohtahara syndrome, a form of encephalopathy with severe early-onset epilepsy. In 
      addition, sequencing of the coding region of STXBP1 in 95 patients with 
      non-syndromic intellectual disability (NSID) revealed de novo truncating mutations 
      in two patients who also showed severe non-specific epilepsy, suggesting that STXBP1 
      disruption has the potential of causing a wide spectrum of epileptic disorders in 
      association with intellectual disability. Here, we report on the mutational 
      screening of STXBP1 in a different series of 50 patients with NSID and the 
      identification of a novel de novo truncating mutation (c.1206delT/ p.Y402X) in a 
      male with NSID, but surprisingly with no history of epilepsy. This is the first 
      report of a patient with a truncating mutation in STXBP1 that does not show 
      epilepsy, thus, expanding the clinical spectrum associated with STXBP1 disruption.

PG  - 185-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore genetic patterns of non-specific mental retardation (NSMR). 
      METHODS: Using segregation analysis, Finney method and Falconer method, the authors 
      studied 157 pedigrees with NSMR selected in a population survey in Shandong 
      province. RESULTS: Ux U multiplex families may accept the autosomal recessive 
      inheritance, Ux U total families is the autosomal recessive inheritance while it may 
      be the multifactorial inheritance with major-gene effect, the frequency of sporadic 
      cases is approximately 46%; Ux A mating families may keep the incomplete penetrance 
      in autosomal dominant inheritance. CONCLUSION: The genetic pattern of NSMR has the 
      genetic heterogeneity.

AB  - During the course of a population study of non-specific mental retardation in 
      school-age males, a 13-year-old boy was ascertained. Cytogenetic studies revealed 
      the presence of a fragile site at chromosome 22. The site was found to be both 
      folate-dependent and heritable. The possibility that the presence of this fragile 
      site is linked to mental retardation is discussed.

TI  - Mosaic pattern of gliosis in the neostriatum of a North American man with 
      craniocervical dystonia and parkinsonism.
PG  - 783-9
AB  - We present the case of a 51-year-old patient with a 31-year history of psychiatric 
      symptoms, craniocervical dystonia, bulbar dysfunction, and parkinsonism. His 
      dystonic movements included blepharospasm, jaw opening and lingual dystonia, and 
      spasmodic retrocollis. Psychiatric symptoms included psychosis and depression, with 
      onset years before the movement disorder. After his death by aspiration, examination 
      of his brain revealed abnormalities limited to the neostriatum. Staining of brain 
      sections, including Holzer, glial fibrillary acidic protein, and immunohistochemical 
      stain for calbindin D28k, revealed the presence of a mosaic pattern of gliosis with 
      neuronal loss (sparing large neurons) within this region. The islands of tissue 
      between stands of gliosis had a normal appearance. This patient represents only the 
      fourth case (and first North American born) with a mosaic pattern of gliosis in the 
      neostriatum. The clinical and pathologic features were similar in all four cases 
      except that our patient was the first with prominent psychiatric symptoms and a more 
      stable, less progressive course. Mosaicism has been described in the X-linked 
      Filipino disorder Lubag. Occurrence in non-Filipino patients, such as ours, suggest 
      that either Lubag can develop in non-Filipino families or that mosaicism is a 
      nonspecific pathologic finding in some patients with idiopathic dystonia. Finally, 
      our case reports the notion that craniocervical dystonia may result from neostriatal 
      dysfunction.

TI  - Supporting people with intellectual disabilities in psychological therapies for 
      depression: A qualitative analysis of supporters' experiences.
PG  - 323-335
LID - 10.1111/jar.12529 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinicians recommend including carers or others in a supporting role in 
      the therapy as an important adaptation of psychological therapies for people with 
      intellectual disabilities. This nested qualitative study from a larger trial 
      explored supporters' experiences of supporting people with intellectual disabilities 
      receiving behavioural activation or guided self-help therapies for depression. 
      METHOD: Twenty-one purposively sampled supporters were interviewed. The 
      semi-structured interviews were subject to framework analysis, covering expectations 
      of therapy, views of therapy sessions, relationships with therapist and participant, 
      and perceived changes. RESULTS: Supporters were positive about both therapies and 
      reported both therapy-specific and nonspecific therapeutic factors that had 
      significant positive impacts on people's lives. Most supporters reported their 
      involvement contributed to the interventions' effectiveness, and helped establish 
      closer relationships to the people they were supporting. CONCLUSIONS: The presence 
      of supporters within psychological therapies for people with intellectual 
      disabilities can be an effective adaptation to therapies for this population.

TI  - Contiguous gene syndromes due to deletions in the distal short arm of the human X 
      chromosome.
PG  - 10001-5
AB  - Mendelian inherited disorders due to deletions of adjacent genes on a chromosome 
      have been described as "contiguous gene syndromes." Short stature, chondrodysplasia 
      punctata, mental retardation, steroid sulfatase deficiency, and Kallmann syndrome 
      have been found as isolated entities or associated in various combinations in 27 
      patients with interstitial and terminal deletions involving the distal short arm of 
      the X chromosome. The use of cDNA and genomic probes from the Xp22-pter region 
      allowed us to identify 12 different deletion intervals and to confirm, and further 
      refine, the chromosomal assignment of X-linked recessive chondrodysplasia punctata 
      and Kallmann syndrome genes. A putative pseudoautosomal gene affecting height and an 
      X-linked non-specific mental retardation gene have been tentatively assigned to 
      specific intervals. The deletion panel described is a useful tool for mapping new 
      sequences and orienting chromosome walks in the region.

TI  - The fragile X-chromosome: an evaluation of the results in a routine cytogenetic 
      laboratory in the period 1981-1986.
PG  - 410-7
AB  - We report on the cytogenetic studies, performed in a routine cytogenetic laboratory 
      between 1981 and 1986, on 428 subjects: 291 probands with non-specific mental 
      retardation, 101 first-degree relatives of fra(X) positive patients and 36 
      non-retarded patients, referred for other reasons. As a rule 50 cells, cultured in 
      folate-deficient medium were analysed. The results are compared with data collected 
      from the literature and with the data expected from prior genetic risks and fra(X) 
      penetrance. If no more than 50 cells were analysed, the fragile site was found in a 
      lower than expected proportion (69.2%) of the retarded first-degree male relatives. 
      The conclude that in a substantial number of unselected patients with mental 
      retardation the diagnosis fra(X) syndrome will only be confirmed cytogenetically if 
      at least 100 cells are analysed. Five percent of the male and 10% of the female 
      index patients showed a fragile X-like abnormality, probably not associated with the 
      Martin-Bell syndrome.

TI  - Severe mental retardation in children from socially disadvantaged families.
PG  - 69-91
AB  - Children receiving ESN(S) education, attending special day schools, and living at 
      home, were categorized into those whose handicap had been medically recognized in 
      infancy and those of unknown aetiology, 'non-specific'. Information obtained from 
      interviews with their families was used to identify a subgroup of those who were 
      relatively socially disadvantaged. Both factors, medical and social, are shown to 
      have a significant effect on early provisions for special needs. The non-specific 
      cases from disadvantaged families tended to have been recognized at a later age than 
      the rest; their parents had less information, less access to services, and less 
      contact with others who could provide aid and support. It is argued that the 
      theoretical model which distinguishes pathogenic and subcultural aetiologies of 
      severe mental subnormality is inappropriate. It may be wrongly applied by 
      fieldworkers, especially those serving families with a developmentally backward 
      preschool child. The result may discriminate against socially disadvantaged families 
      with a child whose handicap is not medically diagnosed.

PG  - 62-4
AB  - The parotid saliva in persons with Down's syndrome was analyzed for three enzymes: 
      acid phosphatase, nonspecific esterase, and amylase. The results have shown a 
      statistically significant elevation of esterase activity in persons with Down's 
      syndrome whereas no statistical differences were observed with the other enzymes. 
      The current investigation has provided further insight into salivary gland 
      metabolism and may have yielded some information pertaining to the genetic control 
      of the processes regulating the electrolyte concentration of human saliva.

TI  - Hearing impairment as an early sign of alpha-mannosidosis in children with a mild 
      phenotype: Report of seven new cases.
PG  - 1756-1763
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.a.61273 [doi]
AB  - Alpha-mannosidosis (AM) is a very rare (prevalence: 1/500000 births) autosomal 
      recessive lysosomal storage disorder. It is characterized by multi-systemic 
      involvement associated with progressive intellectual disability, hearing loss, 
      skeletal anomalies, and coarse facial features. The spectrum is wide, from very 
      severe and lethal to a milder phenotype that usually progresses slowly. AM is caused 
      by a deficiency of lysosomal alpha-mannosidase. A diagnosis can be established by 
      measuring the activity of lysosomal alpha-mannosidase in leucocytes and screening 
      for abnormal urinary excretion of mannose-rich oligosaccharides. Genetic 
      confirmation is obtained with the identification of MAN2B1 mutations. Enzyme 
      replacement therapy (LAMZEDE(R) ) was approved for use in Europe in August 2018. 
      Here, we describe seven individuals from four families, diagnosed at 3-23 years of 
      age, and who were referred to a clinical geneticist for etiologic exploration of 
      syndromic hearing loss, associated with moderate learning disabilities. Exome 
      sequencing had been used to establish the molecular diagnosis in five cases, 
      including a two-sibling pair. In the remaining two patients, the diagnosis was 
      obtained with screening of urinary oligosaccharides excretion and the association of 
      deafness and hypotonia. These observations emphasize that the clinical diagnosis of 
      AM can be challenging, and that it is likely an underdiagnosed rare cause of 
      syndromic hearing loss. Exome sequencing can contribute significantly to the early 
      diagnosis of these nonspecific mild phenotypes, with advantages for treatment and 
      management.

AB  - RAB-GDP dissociation inhibitor 1 (GDI1) loss-of-function mutations are responsible 
      for a form of non-specific X-linked Intellectual Disability (XLID) where the only 
      clinical feature is cognitive impairment. GDI1 patients are impaired in specific 
      aspects of executive functions and conditioned response, which are controlled by 
      fronto-striatal circuitries. Previous molecular and behavioral characterization of 
      the Gdi1-null mouse revealed alterations in the total number/distribution of 
      hippocampal and cortical synaptic vesicles as well as hippocampal short-term 
      synaptic plasticity, and memory deficits. In this study, we employed cognitive 
      protocols with high translational validity to human condition that target the 
      functionality of cortico-striatal circuitry such as attention and stimulus selection 
      ability with progressive degree of complexity. We previously showed that Gdi1-null 
      mice are impaired in some hippocampus-dependent forms of associative learning 
      assessed by aversive procedures. Here, using appetitive-conditioning procedures we 
      further investigated associative learning deficits sustained by the fronto-striatal 
      system. We report that Gdi1-null mice are impaired in attention and associative 
      learning processes, which are a key part of the cognitive impairment observed in 
      XLID patients.

TI  - Computerized EEG analyses of autistic children.
PG  - 169-87
AB  - Electroencephalographic measures of the neurophysiological dysfunction underlying 
      autism have been nonspecific and incomplete. Studies using electroencephalographic 
      methods have been fraught with subject sampling bias, a lack of standardized 
      techniques and measures, and a lack of appropriate control groups. Low-functioning 
      autistic children with age-matched normals, age-matched mentally handicapped, and 
      mentally age-matched normal toddlers were tested using a computerized 
      electroencephalographic technique. The autistic children showed significantly more 
      slow wave activity and less alpha, as well as less inter- and intrahemispheric 
      asymmetry than either normal or mentally handicapped children. In general, 
      electroencephalographic features of autistic children closely resembled those of the 
      toddlers, supporting a model of maturational lag as the key descriptor for autistic 
      CNS functioning. A model of diminished cortical differentiation is proposed to 
      account for the low level of intellectual functioning.

TI  - Families with more than one handicapped child.
PG  - 281-90
AB  - Clinical patterns, aetiological factors and utilization of services were studied in 
      40 families who had more than one handicapped child. By retrospective review of the 
      case notes and interviewing consenting parents (90%), data relating to diagnosis, 
      investigations, genetic counselling, social circumstances and help received were 
      obtained. Both children had the same disorder in 31 families, however in only nine 
      of these families did the children have a specific diagnosis. Non-specific mental 
      retardation was the commonest disorder (40 children). Of the 673 special 
      investigations performed, only 14 were diagnostic. Genetic counselling had been 
      given to only 19 families. Thirty-two of the families had remained as stable units 
      and of the children, 51 received attendance allowances and 21 had periods of respite 
      care. The implications of these findings are discussed.

TI  - Interaction of alphaPIX (ARHGEF6) with beta-parvin (PARVB) suggests an involvement 
      of alphaPIX in integrin-mediated signaling.
PG  - 155-67
AB  - Members of the Rho GTPase family are key regulatory molecules that link surface 
      receptors to the organization of the actin cytoskeleton. It is now well established 
      that these small GTPases are also crucial for neuronal morphogenesis and 
      connectivity. Moreover, mutations in ARHGEF6 (also known as alphaPIX or Cool-2 ), 
      encoding a Rac1/Cdc42-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor, have been 
      implicated in X-linked mental retardation. In an attempt to get insight into the 
      biological function of ARHGEF6 and the upstream signaling cascades leading to its 
      activation, we used the full-length coding region of ARHGEF6 as bait in yeast-two 
      hybrid screens and identified PARVB (beta-parvin or affixin) as a novel binding 
      partner. The interaction was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down. 
      We showed by immunofluorescence that ARHGEF6 and PARVB co-localize at the cell 
      periphery to lamellipodia and ruffles in well-spread and actively spreading cells 
      adhered to fibronectin. In addition, interaction of ARHGEF6 to ARHGEF7 (betaPIX or 
      Cool-1), a close homolog of ARHGEF6, was confirmed. In in vivo assays, two ARHGEF6 
      mutations identified previously in patients with X-linked non-specific mental 
      retardation, ARHGEF6 deltaaa56-83 and deltaaa396-776, abolished interaction of 
      ARHGEF6 to PARVB. Binding between ARHGEF6 and ARHGEF7 was not affected by ARHGEF6 
      deltaaa56-83 but did not occur with ARHGEF6 deltaaa396-776. These data suggest that 
      both the N-terminal calponin homology (CH) and C-terminal coiled-coil domains are 
      necessary for the ARHGEF6-PARVB binding. In contrast, it seems that only the 
      coiled-coil domain is required for the interaction and heterodimerization of ARHGEF6 
      and ARHGEF7. PARVB is known to interact with integrin-linked kinase (ILK) and is 
      involved in the early stage of cell-substrate interaction through integrins. The 
      identification of PARVB as an ARHGEF6 interacting partner together with the 
      co-localization of ARHGEF6 and ILK in spreading cells suggest that ARHGEF6 is 
      involved in integrin-mediated signaling leading to activation of the GTPases Rac1 
      and/or Cdc42.

AB  - Studies of brain lateralization in individuals with non-specific intellectual 
      disability and Down syndrome suggest atypical brain lateralization to speech 
      perception. According to the biological dissociation model, the right hemisphere 
      (RH) mediates speech perception and the left hemisphere (LH) mediates motor control 
      in Down syndrome. The current study aimed to test, for the first time, brain 
      lateralization in both non-specific intellectual disability and Down syndrome, 
      compared to individuals with typical development. Furthermore, bilateral word 
      presentation was utilized to assess interhemispheric communication. Twenty adults 
      with non-specific intellectual disability, 14 adults with Down syndrome, and 30 
      adults with typical development participated in the study. Participants in the 
      non-specific intellectual disability and Down syndrome groups were trained to 
      perform the task prior to the experiment. The results showed that whereas 
      hemispheric lateralization did not differ between individuals with non-specific 
      intellectual disability and typical development, individuals with DS showed reduced 
      brain lateralization in comparison to adults with typical development. All three 
      groups showed no significant difference between words presented to the LH and 
      bilaterally. Our results also show that individuals with intellectual disabilities 
      can benefit from training programmes and that they may perform equally as fast as 
      their typically developing peers.

TI  - Novel mutations in WWOX, RARS2, and C10orf2 genes in consanguineous Arab families 
      with intellectual disability.
PG  - 901-7

AB  - Intellectual disability is a heterogeneous disease with many genes and mutations 
      influencing the phenotype. Consanguineous families constitute a rich resource for 
      the identification of rare variants causing autosomal recessive disease, due to the 
      effects of inbreeding. Here, we examine three consanguineous Arab families, 
      recruited in a quest to identify novel genes/mutations. All the families had 
      multiple offspring with non-specific intellectual disability. We identified 
      homozygosity (autozygosity) intervals in those families through SNP genotyping and 
      whole exome sequencing, with variants filtered using Ingenuity Variant Analysis 
      (IVA) software. The families showed heterogeneity and novel mutations in three 
      different genes known to be associated with intellectual disability. These mutations 
      were not found in 514 ethnically matched control chromosomes. p.G410C in WWOX, 
      p.H530Y in RARS2, and p.I69F in C10orf2 are novel changes that affect protein 
      function and could give new insights into the development and function of the 
      central nervous system.

PG  - 888-92
LID - 10.1007/s10803-014-2185-8 [doi]
AB  - Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by impaired social interaction and 
      communication, restricted interests and repetitive behaviors. Fragile X E is 
      associated with X-linked non-specific mild intellectual disability (ID) and with 
      behavioral problems. Most of the known genetic causes of ASD are also causes of ID, 
      implying that these two identities share common genetic bases. We present a child 
      with an ASD with a normal range of intelligence quotient, that later evolved to 
      compulsive behavior. FRAXE locus analysis by polymerase chain reaction revealed a 
      complete mutation of the FMR 2 gene. This report stresses the importance of 
      clinicians being aware of the association between a full mutation of FMR2 and ASD 
      associated with compulsive behavior despite normal intellectual level.

AB  - The present study aimed to assess the psychometric proprieties of a new social 
      adaptive skills questionnaire and examine the impact of maladaptive behaviour on 
      social functioning in adults with ID of non-specific aetiology and those with Down 
      syndrome. The results of an exploratory factor analysis led to the exclusion of 20 
      items out of 48 and yielded a four-factor structure. The Confirmatory Factor 
      Analysis conducted on 28 remaining items confirmed a four-factor structure 
      explaining 43% of the total variance. The results computed on the global sample 
      (n = 567) showed a "very good" internal consistency for the global score (.89) for 
      all four factors with a very good fit (.97). Thus, this new assessment tool 
      presented a good conceptual validity for assessing social-adaptive skills in adults 
      with ID. The results also showed that participants with DS (no = 92) exhibited a 
      higher global score of social adaptive skills on three subscales (sociability, 
      social relating and respect for social rules) compared to adults with ID of 
      non-specific aetiology (no = 328), and presented a lower level of psychopathology 
      problems. Although aetiology was significantly related to these group differences 
      even after controlling for level of ID and chronological age, the general level of 
      psychopathology fully mediated these relations. In conclusion, the regression 
      coefficient analyses showed that the general level of psychopathology fully mediated 
      the relationship between aetiology and social adaptive skills. A combined assessment 
      of these dimensions should provide information about their predictive value for 
      social functioning in ID adults and target specific remediation goals.

AB  - Asymptomatic testicular enlargement is common in mentally retarded males. This 
      enlargement includes males with non-specific forms of mental retardation as well as 
      a subgroup of males who have a chromosomally recognizable feature involving the 
      X-chromosome ("fragile X" chromosome). We examined the testes of a group of 25 
      mentally retarded males with macro-orchidism including both fragile X and 
      non-fragile X patients. Apart from large size, the testes scanned were all normal in 
      appearance. In particular, there was no evidence for neoplasia. There were no 
      distinguishing features between the fragile X and the non-fragile X groups.

TI  - Clinical features and molecular analysis of the alpha thalassemia/mental retardation 
      syndromes. I. Cases due to deletions involving chromosome band 16p13.3.
PG  - 1112-26
AB  - We describe eight patients who have alpha thalassemia which cannot be accounted for 
      by the Mendelian inheritance of abnormal alpha globin genes. Apart from the 
      hematologic abnormality, the other universal clinical finding is mild to moderate 
      mental handicap; there is also a broad spectrum of associated dysmorphic features. 
      Initial analysis of the alpha globin gene complex (which maps to chromosome band 
      16p13.3), demonstrated that the alpha thalassemia results from failure of the 
      patient to inherit an alpha globin allele from one of the parents. Using a combined 
      molecular and cytogenetic approach, we have extended this analysis to show that all 
      of these patients have 16p deletions which are variable in extent but limited to the 
      terminal band 16p13.3; in at least four cases the deletion results from unbalanced 
      chromosome translocation, and hence aneuploidy of a second chromosome is also 
      present. The relatively nonspecific clinical phenotype contrasts with the other 
      currently known microdeletion syndromes; this may reflect ascertainment bias in the 
      recognition of such syndromes. This work represents the first step in the 
      characterization of a new microdeletion syndrome that is probably underdiagnosed at 
      present.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The demand for support for persons with mild intellectual disability or 
      borderline intellectual functioning is growing rapidly. These persons often 
      encounter individual and familial limitations that influence their human 
      functioning, and often have difficulty coping with the demands of modern society. 
      Although in the areas of policy, research and practice, people with mild 
      intellectual disability or borderline intellectual functioning are generally 
      approached as one group, important differences between them have been reported. 
      Current support seems to be both suboptimal and insufficiently differentiated. 
      METHODS: In this Delphi study we aimed to explore the need for appropriate and 
      differentiated support for individuals with mild intellectual disability or 
      borderline intellectual functioning. The study was based on five unique profiles of 
      persons with mild intellectual disability or borderline intellectual functioning 
      that are associated with individual and environmental variables. The opinions of 
      expert primary caregivers, professional caregivers and scientists were analysed for 
      potentially appropriate types of support for each of the five profiles. RESULTS: A 
      total of 174 statements, divided over the five profiles, were presented to the 
      participants. For 74 statements, consensus was reached between the expert groups. 
      For each profile, these consensual statements represented specific items (e.g. 
      concrete personal goals) and non-specific items (e.g. the attitude towards persons 
      with mild intellectual disability or borderline intellectual functioning, and the 
      coordination of health care) related to the support needs. CONCLUSION: This 
      Delphi-based study generated consensual opinions contributing to a more 
      differentiated system of support for individuals with mild intellectual disability 
      or borderline intellectual functioning. Although these findings need additional 
      investigation, they address actions that might enhance the support programmes for 
      these individuals into more personalized support.

AB  - Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome (AHDS, MIM 300523) is an X-linked neurodegenerative 
      disorder characterized by intellectual disability, severe hypotonia, diminished 
      muscle mass, and progressive spastic paraplegia. All affected males have 
      pathognomonic thyroid profiles with an elevated T3 , low-normal free T4 , and normal 
      TSH. Mutations in the monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8) gene, SLC16A2, have been 
      found to be causative. Here, we describe a proband whose extensive evaluation and 
      ultimate diagnosis of AHDS unmasked three previously undiagnosed generations of 
      affected individuals in one family. This case illustrates the need for clinicians to 
      consider obtaining full thyroid studies on individuals with the non-specific 
      findings of severe hypotonia, failure to thrive, and gross motor delay.

TI  - Visual attention and academic performance in children with developmental 
      disabilities and behavioural attention deficits.
LID - 10.1111/desc.12468 [doi]
AB  - Despite well-documented attention deficits in children with intellectual and 
      developmental disabilities (IDD), distinctions across types of attention problems 
      and their association with academic attainment has not been fully explored. This 
      study examines visual attention capacities and inattentive/hyperactive behaviours in 
      77 children aged 4 to 11 years with IDD and elevated behavioural attention 
      difficulties. Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD; n = 23), Down syndrome 
      (DS; n = 22), and non-specific intellectual disability (NSID; n = 32) completed 
      computerized visual search and vigilance paradigms. In addition, parents and 
      teachers completed rating scales of inattention and hyperactivity. Concurrent 
      associations between attention abilities and early literacy and numeracy skills were 
      also examined. Children completed measures of receptive vocabulary, phonological 
      abilities and cardinality skills. As expected, the results indicated that all groups 
      had relatively comparable levels of inattentive/hyperactive behaviours as rated by 
      parents and teachers. However, the extent of visual attention deficits varied as a 
      result of group; namely children with DS had poorer visual search and vigilance 
      abilities than children with ASD and NSID. Further, significant associations between 
      visual attention difficulties and poorer literacy and numeracy skills were observed, 
      regardless of group. Collectively the findings demonstrate that in children with IDD 
      who present with homogenous behavioural attention difficulties, at the cognitive 
      level, subtle profiles of attentional problems can be delineated.

PG  - 170-3
AB  - alpha 1-Antitrypsin phenotypes and alpha 2-macroglobulin concentrations were 
      determined for an Australian population of 286 Down's syndrome patients, 296 newborn 
      babies, and 193 patients with non-specific mental retardation. There was no 
      significant difference between the groups in the distribution of the phenotypes or 
      level of heterozygosity. The phenotypic frequencies were 89.5% PiMM, 8.0% PiMS and 
      1.0% PiMZ among controls. The mean alpha 2-macroglobulin concentrations were 
      investigated and it was shown that PiMZ phenotypes had a higher concentration, 2.67 
      +/- 0.27 g/l (newborns) and 2.74 +/- 0.32 g/l (Down's syndrome), in comparison with 
      PiMS, PiSS, and PiMM.

TI  - Clinical correlates of very fast beta activity in the EEG.
PG  - 237-41
AB  - Beta activity of 30-40 hz is rarely encountered, and has been reported to be more 
      common in retarded individuals and those with psychiatric disorders. Of 3752 records 
      in 1982-83, 0.8 percent demonstrated beta activity of 30 hz or faster, with a 
      disproportionate representation of psychiatric symptoms and mental retardation in 
      comparison with the general EEG referral population. No other specific correlations 
      were evident, but the activity also occurred in neurologically and psychiatrically 
      normal individuals. Although these findings may imply an association between very 
      fast beta activity and psychiatric illness or mental subnormality, that association 
      may be spurious or nonspecific in view of the small and heterogenous population 
      demonstrating this type of beta activity. Controversy concerning very fast beta 
      activity, as well as other infrequent or controversial patterns, may be lessened by 
      application of spectral analysis and statistical techniques which are increasingly 
      available for clinical EEG studies.

TI  - A componential view of theory of mind: evidence from Williams syndrome.
PG  - 59-90
AB  - In this paper we argue that there are two distinct components of a theory of mind: a 
      social-cognitive and a social-perceptual component. Evidence for this proposal is 
      presented from various sources, including studies of children with Williams 
      syndrome, a rare genetic neurodevelopmental disorder. Earlier work has demonstrated 
      that people with Williams syndrome appear to be spared in the social-perceptual 
      component of a theory of mind. In this paper we present evidence that they are not 
      spared in the social-cognitive component of theory of mind. Three experiments with 
      young children with Williams syndrome were conducted. In each experiment the 
      children with Williams syndrome were compared to age-, IQ-, and language-matched 
      children with Prader-Willi syndrome, and children with non-specific mental 
      retardation. The experiments used different measures of theory of mind ability, 
      including false belief (Experiment 1), explanation of action (Experiment 2), and 
      recognition of emotional expressions (Experiment 3). In none of these experiments 
      did the children with Williams syndrome evidence superior performance compared to 
      the control groups. The results from this and other studies on Williams syndrome 
      support the view that the social-cognitive and social-perceptual components of a 
      theory of mind are dissociable. In Williams syndrome only the latter components, 
      which are linked to distinct neurobiological substrates, are spared.

      TBC1-domain-containing kinase (TBCK) were identified through whole-exome sequencing. 
      All affected individuals were found to share a core phenotype of intellectual

      white-matter changes on neuroimaging. Minor non-specific facial dysmorphism was also 
      noted in some individuals, including multiple older children who developed coarse 
      features similar to those of storage disorders. TBCK has been shown to regulate the 
      mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway, which is also stimulated by 
      exogenous leucine supplementation. TBCK was absent in cells from affected 
      individuals, and decreased phosphorylation of phospho-ribosomal protein S6 was also 
      observed, a finding suggestive of downregulation of mTOR signaling. Lastly, we 
      demonstrated that activation of the mTOR pathway in response to L-leucine 
      supplementation was retained, suggesting a possible avenue for directed therapies 
      for this condition.

TI  - Disease-causing variants in TCF4 are a frequent cause of intellectual disability: 
      lessons from large-scale sequencing approaches in diagnosis.
PG  - 996-1006
LID - 10.1038/s41431-018-0096-4 [doi]
AB  - High-throughput sequencing (HTS) of human genome coding regions allows the 
      simultaneous screen of a large number of genes, significantly improving the 
      diagnosis of non-syndromic intellectual disabilities (ID). HTS studies permit the 
      redefinition of the phenotypical spectrum of known disease-causing genes, escaping 
      the clinical inclusion bias of gene-by-gene Sanger sequencing. We studied a cohort 
      of 903 patients with ID not reminiscent of a well-known syndrome, using an 
      ID-targeted HTS of several hundred genes and found de novo heterozygous variants in 
      TCF4 (transcription factor 4) in eight novel patients. Piecing together the patients 
      from this study and those from previous large-scale unbiased HTS studies, we 
      estimated the rate of individuals with ID carrying a disease-causing TCF4 mutation 
      to 0.7%. So far, TCF4 molecular abnormalities were known to cause a syndromic form 
      of ID, Pitt-Hopkins syndrome (PTHS), which combines severe ID, developmental delay, 
      absence of speech, behavioral and ventilation disorders, and a distinctive facial 
      gestalt. Therefore, we reevaluated ten patients carrying a pathogenic or likely 
      pathogenic variant in TCF4 (eight patients included in this study and two from our 
      previous ID-HTS study) for PTHS criteria defined by Whalen and Marangi. A 
      posteriori, five patients had a score highly evocative of PTHS, three were possibly 
      consistent with this diagnosis, and two had a score below the defined PTHS 
      threshold. In conclusion, these results highlight TCF4 as a frequent cause of 
      moderate to profound ID and broaden the clinical spectrum associated to TCF4 
      mutations to nonspecific ID.

AB  - A psychoanalyst who listens to a Down syndrome child can discover how this 
      disability, which makes the child seem somewhat strange, is integrated into the 
      development of the personality by non-specific psychic processes similar to those at 
      work in other children. This can occur only if the reciprocal identification between 
      parents and child is not made impossible by the traumatic significance of the 
      handicap. Early therapy can restore a narcissistically positive image of the child 
      and free the family dynamics previously paralyzed around the handicap. The author 
      reports on the two cases that prompted these considerations: the psychotherapy of a 
      Down syndrome girl between 5 and 7 years of age and sessions with the mother of a 
      5-year old Down syndrome boy.

TI  - Prevalence of fragile X(A) syndrome in mentally retarded children at a genetics 
      referral centre in Delhi, India.
PG  - 12-6
AB  - The usefulness of the clinical score based on Turner 5-trait scale prior to 
      undertaking cytogenetic or molecular tests for the diagnosis of the fragile X(A) 
      syndrome was evaluated. Mean clinical score in fragile X positive patients was 
      significantly higher than in fragile X negative patients (7.06 +/- 1.85 vs 2.98 +/- 
      1.6, P < 0.0001). Of 1206 children with mental retardation 360 (29.8%) boys 
      fulfilled defined clinical criteria to be screened for fragile X syndrome by 
      chromosomal studies. Twenty three (6.38%) of them were found to be positive for 
      fragile X syndrome using cytogenetic techniques. Molecular confirmation in 21 
      affected boys (two were lost to follow up) showed full mutation in 19 (5.27%). Two 
      patients showed a normal 5.2 kb band on southern blot. This frequency (5.27%) of 
      fragile X(A) patients among children with non-specific mental retardation is 
      comparable to the results of studies in the West. Routine use of the clinical score, 
      and the selection of patients with a score > or = 5 for diagnostic tests would 
      reduce the laboratory load, especially in countries with limited facilities.

TI  - Interstitial 6q25 microdeletion syndrome: ARID1B is the key gene.
PG  - 1257-61
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.a.37553 [doi]
AB  - Interstitial deletions of the long arm of chromosome 6 are rare. Clinically, these 
      deletions are considered to be part of a unique microdeletion syndrome associated 
      with intellectual disability and speech impairment, typical dysmorphic features, 
      structural anomalies of the brain, microcephaly, and non-specific multiple organ 
      anomalies. The critical region for the interstitial 6q microdeletion phenotype was 
      mapped to 6q24-6q25, particularly the 6q25.3 region containing the genes ARID1B and 
      ZDHHC14. It has been hypothesized that haploinsufficiency of these genes impairs 
      normal development of the brain and is responsible for the phenotype. This case 
      report describes a girl presenting with typical features of 6q microdeletion 
      syndrome, including global developmental delay, speech impairment, distinct 
      dysmorphic features, dysgenesis of the corpus callosum, common limb anomalies, and 
      hearing loss. Chromosome analysis by array-CGH revealed a small interstitial 6q 
      deletion spanning approximately 1.1 Mb of DNA and containing only one coding gene, 
      ARID1B. We suggest that ARID1B is the key gene behind 6q microdeletion syndrome, and 
      we discuss its possible role in the phenotypic manifestations.

TI  - Utility of subtelomeric fluorescent DNA probes for detection of chromosome anomalies 
      in 425 patients.
PG  - 28-34
AB  - PURPOSE: A complete set of subtelomeric fluorescent DNA probes, except the 
      acrocentric p-arms, was developed in 1996, was optimized in 1998, and is 
      commercially available. These and other fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) 
      probes have been used to detect anomalies of the subtelomere regions among groups of 
      patients with idiopathic mental retardation (MR), developmental delay (DD), and/or 
      nonspecific dysmorphic features (NDF), and individuals with multiple miscarriages 
      (MM) who were karyotypically normal by standard G-banding techniques. METHODS: A 
      total of 425 patients were analyzed, of whom 372 had idiopathic MR/DD/NDF and 53 
      were involved in MM. An effort was made to select individuals for this study who 
      were either normal karyotypically or who had subtle chromosomal anomalies that were 
      inconclusive by banded chromosome analysis, although this was not always possible. 
      RESULTS: Anomalies involving the subtelomere regions were detected at a frequency of 
      6.8% in the MR/DD/NDF group. The cryptic or subtle anomalies are estimated to be 
      about 3.4%. It was necessary to use M-FISH, chromosome, and locus specific FISH 
      probes to clarify some of the abnormalities. No abnormalities were detected in the 
      MM group. Deletion variants were present for 2qter, 7pter, and Xpter/Ypter 
      subtelomeric regions ranging from <1 to 9.6%. CONCLUSIONS: The subtelomeric FISH 
      probes are instrumental in the detection of subtelomeric anomalies in a significant 
      proportion, although no more than 50% are subtle, of patients with idiopathic 
      MR/DD/NDF. In some cases, however, it was necessary to use other FISH probes to 
      clarify the nature of these abnormalities. No subtelomeric abnormalities were 
      detected in our group of 53 MM patients, suggesting a relatively low frequency of 
      occurrence in this patient population.

TI  - Null mutation in PGAP1 impairing Gpi-anchor maturation in patients with intellectual 
      disability and encephalopathy.
PG  - e1004320

AB  - Many eukaryotic cell-surface proteins are anchored to the membrane via 
      glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI). There are at least 26 genes involved in 
      biosynthesis and remodeling of GPI anchors. Hypomorphic coding mutations in seven of 
      these genes have been reported to cause decreased expression of GPI anchored 
      proteins (GPI-APs) on the cell surface and to cause autosomal-recessive forms of 
      intellectual disability (ARID). We performed homozygosity mapping and exome 
      sequencing in a family with encephalopathy and non-specific ARID and identified a 
      homozygous 3 bp deletion (p.Leu197del) in the GPI remodeling gene PGAP1. PGAP1 was 
      not described in association with a human phenotype before. PGAP1 is a deacylase 
      that removes an acyl-chain from the inositol of GPI anchors in the endoplasmic 
      reticulum immediately after attachment of GPI to proteins. In silico prediction and 
      molecular modeling strongly suggested a pathogenic effect of the identified 
      deletion. The expression levels of GPI-APs on B lymphoblastoid cells derived from an 
      affected person were normal. However, when those cells were incubated with 
      phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC), GPI-APs were cleaved and 
      released from B lymphoblastoid cells from healthy individuals whereas GPI-APs on the 
      cells from the affected person were totally resistant. Transfection with wild type 
      PGAP1 cDNA restored the PI-PLC sensitivity. These results indicate that GPI-APs were 
      expressed with abnormal GPI structure due to a null mutation in the remodeling gene 
      PGAP1. Our results add PGAP1 to the growing list of GPI abnormalities and indicate 
      that not only the cell surface expression levels of GPI-APs but also the fine 
      structure of GPI-anchors is important for the normal neurological development.

LID - 10.1007/s10803-011-1229-6 [doi]
AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) and Smith-Magenis syndrome (SMS) are associated with a 
      number of specific topographies of problem behavior. Very few studies have examined 
      the function served by problem behavior in these groups. Using the Questions About 
      Behavioral Function scale Matson and Vollmer (User's guide: questions about 
      behavioral function (QABF). Scientific Publishers Inc., Baton Rouge, LA, 1995) the 
      current study examined group differences in the function of problem behavior 
      displayed by children with FXS and SMS, in comparison to a control group of children 
      with non-specific intellectual and developmental disabilities. Between-group 
      analyses showed children with SMS were more likely to display problem behavior 
      related to physical discomfort. Both within- and between-group analyses showed 
      children with FXS were less likely to display attention-maintained problem behavior. 
      These findings hold implications for the assessment, treatment and prevention of 
      problem behavior associated with both FXS and SMS.

PG  - 332-43
LID - 10.3109/13668250.2013.826346 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: According to the literature, children with Down syndrome (DS) have 
      difficulties recognising facial expressions. Yet abilities to recognise emotional 
      expressions are often assessed in tasks that imply comprehension of words for 
      emotions. We investigated the development of these abilities in children with DS in 
      a longitudinal study that did not involve lexical knowledge of emotions. METHOD: 
      Children with DS and nonspecific intellectual disability and typically developing 
      children matched for developmental age (DA) were assessed once a year over 3 years. 
      They were asked to recognise the facial expression of an emotion after hearing a 
      vocalisation. RESULTS: In each annual session, children with DS were not 
      significantly different from others at recognising emotions. Their abilities to 
      discriminate basic emotions improved significantly and to a similar extent to those 
      of other children. CONCLUSION: The findings indicate that children with DS develop 
      emotion recognition abilities similarly to other children of the same DA.

LID - 10.1038/jhg.2015.106 [doi]
AB  - Here, we report on a patient with a 625 kb duplication in Xp22.12, detected by array 
      comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). The duplicated region contains only one 
      gene, RPS6KA3, that results in partial duplication. The same duplication was present 
      in his mother and his maternal uncle. This partial duplication inhibits the RPS6KA3 
      expression, mimicking the effect of loss-of-function mutations associated with 
      Coffin-Lowry syndrome (CLS). The phenotype of the patient here presented is not 
      fully evocative of this syndrome because he does not present some of the facial, 
      digital and skeletal abnormalities that are considered the main diagnostic features 
      of CLS. This case is one of the few examples where RPS6KA3 mutations are associated 
      with a non-specific X-linked mental retardation.

AB  - FG syndrome, Lujan syndrome, and Ohdo syndrome, the Maat-Kievit-Brunner type, have 
      been described as distinct syndromes with overlapping non-specific features and 
      different missense mutations of the MED12 gene have been reported in all of them. We 
      report a family including 10 males and 1 female affected with profound non-specific 
      intellectual disability (ID) which was linked to a 30-cM region extending from 
      Xp11.21 (ALAS2) to Xq22.3 (COL4A5). Parallel sequencing of all X-chromosome exons 
      identified a frameshift mutation (c.5898dupC) of MED12. Mutated mRNA was not 
      affected by non-sense mediated RNA decay and induced an additional abnormal isoform 
      due to activation of cryptic splice-sites in exon 41. Dysmorphic features common to 
      most affected males were long narrow face, high forehead, flat malar area, high 
      nasal bridge, and short philtrum. Language was absent or very limited. Most patients 
      had a friendly personality. Cognitive impairment, varying from borderline to 
      profound ID was similarly observed in seven heterozygous females. There was no 
      correlation between cognitive function and X-chromosome inactivation profiles in 
      blood cells. The severe degree of ID in male patients, as well as variable cognitive 
      impairment in heterozygous females suggests that the duplication observed in the 
      present family may have a more severe effect on MED12 function than missense 
      mutations. In a cognitively impaired male from this family, who also presented with 
      tall stature and dysmorphism and did not have the MED12 mutation, a 600-kb 
      duplication at 17p13.3 including the YWHAE gene, was found in a mosaic state.

TI  - Fragile (X) syndrome: a study of the psychological profile in 23 prepubertal 
      patients.
PG  - 179-86
AB  - In this study a further analysis of the psychological profile in the prepubertal 
      fragile (X) (fra(X] male was performed. The results of the psycho-diagnostic 
      examination of 23 fra(X) boys were compared to a control group of 17 males of the 
      same age with 'non-specific' mental retardation. A number of important quantitative 
      and qualitative differences were observed between the two groups. In the preschool 
      age group the majority of fra(X) boys was mildly mentally retarded. In the 
      school-age group, however, most boys were moderately to severely mentally retarded. 
      This indication of a decline in intellectual performance with age in the fra(X) 
      syndrome was confirmed by a longitudinal individual follow-up of seven fra(X) boys 
      in this age group. In contrast to intellectual performance, appearance of the 
      attention deficit disorder (or hyperkinesis), with its attendent overactivity and 
      impulsiveness, decreases with age, and is independent of the intellectual level. 
      Autistic behaviour was more frequently observed in the youngest fra(X) males, and 
      was more pronounced in the moderately mentally retarded. In more than 50% of the 
      boys of preschool age the association of hyperkinesis and autistic features was 
      found. Language and speech development in the fra(X) syndrome is both symptomatic 
      and specific. Beside a severe, global speech retardation, there are some distinct 
      speech characteristics in the young fra(X) males such as rapid speech rhythm, speech 
      impulsiveness and perseverative speech.

TI  - Systematic molecular and cytogenetic screening of 100 patients with marfanoid 
      syndromes and intellectual disability.
PG  - 507-21
LID - 10.1111/cge.12094 [doi]
AB  - The association of marfanoid habitus (MH) and intellectual disability (ID) has been 
      reported in the literature, with overlapping presentations and genetic 
      heterogeneity. A hundred patients (71 males and 29 females) with a MH and ID were 
      recruited. Custom-designed 244K array-CGH (Agilent®; Agilent Technologies Inc., 
      Santa Clara, CA) and MED12, ZDHHC9, UPF3B, FBN1, TGFBR1 and TGFBR2 sequencing 
      analyses were performed. Eighty patients could be classified as isolated MH and ID: 
      12 chromosomal imbalances, 1 FBN1 mutation and 1 possibly pathogenic MED12 mutation 
      were found (17%). Twenty patients could be classified as ID with other 
      extra-skeletal features of the Marfan syndrome (MFS) spectrum: 4 pathogenic FBN1 
      mutations and 4 chromosomal imbalances were found (2 patients with both FBN1 
      mutation and chromosomal rearrangement) (29%). These results suggest either that 
      there are more loci with genes yet to be discovered or that MH can also be a 
      relatively non-specific feature of patients with ID. The search for aortic 
      complications is mandatory even if MH is associated with ID since FBN1 mutations or 
      rearrangements were found in some patients. The excess of males is in favour of the 
      involvement of other X-linked genes. Although it was impossible to make a diagnosis 
      in 80% of patients, these results will improve genetic counselling in families.

      and/or anal anomalies and joint hyperlaxity. Mental deficiency is the rule. 
      Craniofacial dysmorphism is nonspecific. Macrocephaly may be present at birth or

TI  - The cerebral cortex in fetal Down syndrome.
PG  - 159-63
AB  - Brain histopathology of 32 fetuses with Down syndrome was compared to that of 25 
      age-matched normal controls and 9 brains of fetuses of HIV positive mothers. Four 
      cases of Down syndrome and 1 HIV case showed microdysgenesia of the cerebral cortex. 
      As the pathogenetic background of cortical irregularities is presently not known, we 
      analyzed the neuronal expression of drebrin, an actin-binding protein of neuronal 
      dendritic spines. This protein is thought to play a role in synaptic formation and 
      was recently shown to be manifold reduced in brains of fetuses with Down syndrome. 
      However, immunocytochemistry revealed no differences in drebrin expression pattern 
      between Down patients and controls. We conclude that cerebral cortical 
      microdysgenesia is an infrequent non-specific pathology in fetal Down syndrome.

AB  - 17q11.2 microduplication syndrome is a recently described relatively rare condition 
      associated with a nonspecific phenotype. Intellectual disability, developmental 
      delay, and dysmorphisms are the only clinical features common to a majority of 
      cases. Seventeen patients have been reported so far. Here, we present another 
      patient with 17q11.2 duplication and no signs of neurofibromatosis type 1, 
      identified by array-CGH. We compared clinical features and genetic data with those 
      of previously reported patients with 17q11.2 microduplications. We also analyzed the 
      gene content of the duplicated region in order to investigate the possible role of 
      specific genes in the clinical phenotype of our patient.

TI  - Sotos syndrome (cerebral gigantism): a clinical and radiological study of 14 cases 
      from Saudi Arabia.
PG  - 197-203
AB  - Fourteen children (of Arab ethnic origin) with Sotos syndrome are described. They 
      were referred to King Khalid University Hospital, Riyadh between July 1992 and June 
      1997. Their phenotypic characteristics were compared with established diagnostic 
      criteria. There was a male:female ratio of 1.3:1 and a high rate of consanguinity 
      (36%) among parents. At birth, 54% were large and about one-third showed increased 
      height and occipitofrontal head circumference (OFHC). The neonatal histories 
      revealed respiratory and feeding problems in 21%, followed later by delayed motor 
      milestones and speech development in 57%. During childhood, weight, height and OFHC 
      increased further to > 97th centile in 71%, 71% and 93%, respectively. A seizure 
      disorder affected 43%, and 75% had mental retardation (IQ < 70). A non-specific EEG 
      abnormality was found in half of those with seizures. Cranial CT/MRI showed 
      ventricular dilatation in 15% and one patient had corpus callosum dysgenesis. 
      Abdominal ultrasound revealed hydronephrosis in two patients. Radiological 
      cephalometric measurements showed relative prognathism in cases of Sotos syndrome 
      compared with controls (p = 0.003). The study highlights the importance of 
      considering Sotos syndrome in children who present with psychomotor delay.

AB  - PROBLEM: Comorbid psychiatric diagnoses tend to be underdiagnosed in patients with 
      intellectual disability. Diagnosing anxiety disorders in such patients can pose 
      challenges, in particular with regard to obsessive and compulsive disorder (OCD). 
      METHODS: We present the case of an adolescent diagnosed with intellectual disability 
      with poor expressive language skills who presented with nonspecific mood and 
      behavioral symptoms, not improving with routine clinical evaluations and treatment. 
      A structured assessment was done to decipher the psychopathology. FINDINGS: The 
      structured evaluation was able to diagnose OCD, and the treatment response was 
      accentuated, bringing about a significant reduction in patient and caregiver 
      distress. Psychosocial interventions through nurses played a significant role. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The case highlights the need for a systematic assessment of patients 
      with intellectual disability to arrive at reliable diagnoses and to plan appropriate 
      treatment strategies.

AB  - The use of pharmacologic agents in the control of aggression and self-mutilation in 
      the mentally retarded is controversial but at times necessary for the implementation 
      of behavioral treatments. The choice of drug is often empirical, as the specific 
      etiology of aggression is generally unknown. On the other hand, certain rare 
      conditions may be treated specifically. Controlled therapeutic studies are still 
      lacking, as most treatments are symptomatic and nonspecific.

      Xp22.
PG  - 581-5
AB  - A gene responsible for a non-specific form of X-linked mental retardation (MRX19) 
      was localised by linkage analysis. Exclusions and regional localisation were made 
      using 21 highly informative PCR-based markers along the X chromosome. Significant 
      lod scores at a recombination fraction of zero were detected with the marker loci 
      DXS207, DXS987 (Zmax = 3.58) and DXS999 (Zmax = 3.28) indicating that this gene is 
      localised to the proximal portion of Xp22. Recombination between MRX19 and the 
      flanking loci KAL and DXS989 was observed. The multipoint CEPH background map, with 
      map distances in cM, is DXS996-1.8-KAL-19.0-DXS207-0.9-[DXS987,DXS443 
      ]-4.3-DXS999-3.5-DXS365-14.0-DXS989. Two other MRX disorders and two syndromal 
      mental retardations, Coffin-Lowry syndrome and Partington syndrome, have been mapped 
      to this region. There is a possibility that the 3 MRX disorders are the same entity. 
      Most MRX disorders remain clustered around the pericentromeric region.

TI  - Offenders with intellectual disability: a prospective comparative study.
PG  - 69-76
AB  - BACKGROUND: Intellectually disabled offenders (IDO) are a poorly served and 
      under-recognized group, who are likely to require long-term specialist treatments 
      and interventions. METHOD: This prospective study investigated the characteristics 
      and factors that influence outcome in this group, with particular reference to 
      therapeutic interventions. Sixty-one individuals were identified from contact with 
      either (1) specialist health and social services for people with intellectual 
      disability (ID) or (2) nonspecialist services in the criminal justice or (forensic) 
      mental health/social service systems. The participants were assessed at baseline and 
      after a mean of 10 months in order to compare recidivism rates and the impact of 
      therapeutic interventions. RESULTS: The findings suggest that IDO start offending at 
      an early age, that they frequently have a history of multiple offences, and that sex 
      offending and arson are over-represented offence types. Those participants recruited 
      from nonspecialist ID services had significantly higher IQs and were less likely to 
      have had contact with community social and health support agencies. Despite the high 
      rates of psychopathology, there was little evidence for efficacy of therapeutic 
      interventions, which, where offered, appeared to be of a nonspecific nature. At 
      second interview, approximately half of the sample had re-offended.

      displays a peculiar neurometabolic profile.
PG  - 2377-2383
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.a.61773 [doi]
AB  - Mutations in the MBOAT7 gene have been described in 43 patients, belonging to 18 
      families, showing nonspecific clinical features (intellectual disability [ID], 
      seizures, microcephaly or macrocephaly, and mild to moderate cerebellar atrophy) 
      that make the clinical diagnosis difficult. Here we report the first Italian 
      patient, a 22.5-year-old female, one of the oldest reported, born to apparently 
      consanguineous parents. She shows severe ID, macrocephaly, seizures, aggressive 
      outbursts, hyperphagia. We also documented progressive atrophy of the cerebellar 
      vermis, that appeared not before the age of 7. The whole-exome sequencing of the 
      trio identified a novel homozygous variant c.1057_1058delGCinsCA (p.Ala353His) in 
      the MBOAT7 gene. The variant is considered to be likely pathogenic, since it is 
      absent from population database and it lies in a highly conserved amino acid 
      residue. This disorder has a neurometabolic pathogenesis, implicating a phospholipid 
      remodeling abnormalities. A brain hydrogen-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-MRS) 
      examination in our patient disclosed a peculiar neurometabolic profile in the 
      cerebellar hemispheric region. This new finding could address the clinical suspicion 
      of MBOAT7-related disorder, among the wide range of genetic conditions associated 
      with ID and cerebellar atrophy. Moreover, the documented progression of cerebellar 
      atrophy and the worsening of the disease only after some years open to the 
      possibility of a therapeutic window after birth.

      mean age 28 years, range 3-65 years) with a confirmed diagnosis of the Finnish type 
      of sialic acid storage disease (FSASD) and 200 controls with mental retardation 
      without any evidence of metabolic disease were examined for the presence of 
      vacuolated lymphocytes. Urine samples were analysed by thin-layer chromatography for 
      free sialic acid. Only 62% of the patients with FSASD had a clearly increased 
      percentage of vacuolated lymphocytes (greater than normal mean + 2 s.d.). In 
      thin-layer chromatography all the FSASD patients gave a positive test result. No 
      false positive or negative results were obtained. Electronmicroscopical examination 
      of peripheral blood lymphocytes demonstrated only non-specific changes in a few 
      cells. Examination of peripheral lymphocytes for vacuoles is not a reliable 
      screening test for FSASD. The screening method of choice is the analysis of free 
      sialic acid by thin-layer chromatography.

TI  - Training parents of retarded children: program-specific outcomes.
PG  - 255-60
AB  - This study examined the specificity of outcome in a group behavior modification 
      training program for parents of developmentally disabled children. Fifteen families 
      were randomly assigned to either a Parents as Teachers or Parents as Advocates 
      course. Measures of behavior modification knowledge and skill, and advocacy 
      knowledge and skill were administered to all subjects pre and post training. On 
      three of the four outcome measures, subjects demonstrated gains that were specific 
      to their training program. The effects of nonspecific factors appear to have been 
      minimal.

TI  - Executive function in preschoolers with autism: evidence consistent with a secondary 
      deficit.
PG  - 1068-79
AB  - Recent research on executive function (EF) deficits in autism has led investigators 
      to conclude that EF deficits are secondary to the disorder. The current study has 
      two major goals: (1) Examine whether specific EF deficits are present in the 
      youngest autism group to date (mean=2.9 years), and (2) examine whether such 
      deficits are secondary to autism, or act as an early non-specific cognitive risk 
      factor for autism by comparing EF abilities of this autism group to a CA-matched 
      typically developing group. Results from Experiment 1 suggest no specific EF 
      deficits in autism relative to MA-matched controls, while results from Experiment 2 
      are consistent with the hypothesis that EF deficits may emerge as a secondary 
      deficit in autism. Alternative hypotheses are also considered.

PG  - 525-37
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2788.2010.01277.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Data on typically developing children show that humour development 
      starts from an early age. Studies investigating humour in children with intellectual 
      disability (ID) are few and have generally focused on identifying differences 
      between this population and other groups of children. This study focuses on children 
      with ID as a heterogeneous group and seeks to answer the following questions: (1) 
      what kinds of humour do children with ID appreciate most in a video cartoon? (2) How 
      does the mode of presentation of jokes influence humour comprehension? METHOD: This 
      study examines humour appreciation and comprehension in school-aged children (n = 9; 
      chronological age: 7-11 years) with mild/moderate ID. Specific tools were developed 
      to explore each aspect. Participants rated short scenes from a video cartoon to show 
      their appreciation for different kinds of humour. A set of video-recorded jokes, 
      with different modes of presentation, were used in the comprehension task. RESULTS: 
      The greatest appreciation was expressed for physical and visual humour. Non-specific 
      scenes (i.e. scenes with no particularly funny elements) were also rated highly. 
      Jokes presented with gesture were understood more than jokes told without supports. 
      These differences in comprehension, arising from supported/unsupported jokes, were 
      statistically significant within the group studied. CONCLUSIONS: The context of 
      humour (e.g. being part of a video cartoon) is important in determining what 
      children with ID find funny. The significant difference in comprehension brought 
      about by a change in mode of presentation (i.e. supported/unsupported joke telling) 
      suggests that humour comprehension can be facilitated.

TI  - Family MRX9 revisited: further evidence for locus heterogeneity in MRX.
PG  - 17-22
AB  - Nonspecific X-linked mental retardation (MRX) patients are characterized by mental 
      retardation, without additional distinguishing features. Consequently, MRX families 
      can only be distinguished by mapping studies; yet, due to imprecise mapping studies 
      performed in the past, the number of genes causing MRX is debatable, and a more 
      precise localization for families is necessary to estimate this number. MRX 9 has 
      been mapped to the pericentromeric region Xp21-q13. We refined the mapping of the 
      MRX9 family to Xp11.22-Xp11.4. A sequencing analysis of three likely candidate genes 
      in Xp11, SREB3, synapsin I, and TM4SF2, revealed no mutations.

TI  - The novel homozygous KCNJ10 c.986T>C (p.(Leu329Pro)) variant is pathogenic for the 
      SeSAME/EAST homologue in Malinois dogs.
PG  - 222-226
LID - 10.1038/ejhg.2016.157 [doi]
AB  - SeSAME/EAST syndrome is a multisystemic disorder in humans, characterised by 
      seizures, sensorineural deafness, ataxia, developmental delay and electrolyte 
      imbalance. It is exclusively caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous 
      variations in the KCNJ10 gene. Here we describe a similar syndrome in two families 
      belonging to the Malinois dog breed, based on clinical, neurological, 
      electrodiagnostic and histopathological examination. Genetic analysis detected a 
      novel pathogenic KCNJ10 c.986T>C (p.(Leu329Pro)) variant that is inherited in an 
      autosomal recessive way. This variant has an allele frequency of 2.9% in the Belgian 
      Malinois population, but is not found in closely related dog breeds or in dog breeds 
      where similar symptoms have been already described. The canine phenotype is 
      remarkably similar to humans, including ataxia and seizures. In addition, in half of 
      the dogs clinical and electrophysiological signs of neuromyotonia were observed. 
      Because there is currently no cure and treatment is nonspecific and unsatisfactory, 
      this canine translational model could be used for further elucidating the 
      genotype/phenotype correlation of this monogenic multisystem disorder and as an 
      excellent intermediate step for drug safety testing and efficacy evaluations before 
      initiating human studies.

PG  - 1845-1851

AB  - Gross deletions involving the MEIS2 gene have been described in a small number of 
      patients with overlapping phenotypes of atrial or ventricular septal defects, cleft 
      palate, and variable developmental delays and intellectual disability. Non-specific 
      dysmorphic features were noted in some patients, including broad forehead with high 
      anterior hairline, arched eyebrows, thin or tented upper lip, and short philtrum. 
      Recently, a patient with a de novo single amino acid deletion, c.998_1000delGAA 
      (p.Arg333del), and a patient with a de novo nonsense variant, (c.611C>G, p.Ser204*), 
      were reported with a similar, but apparently more severe phenotypes. Clinical whole 
      exome sequencing (WES) performed at our clinical molecular diagnostic laboratory 
      identified four additional patients with predicted damaging de novo MEIS2 missense 
      variants. Our patients' features closely resembled those previously reported in 
      patients with gross deletions, but also included some less commonly reported 
      features, such as autism spectrum disorder, hearing loss, and short stature, as well 
      as features that may be unique to nucleotide-level variants, such as hypotonia, 
      failure to thrive, gastrointestinal, skeletal, limb, and skin abnormalities. All of 
      the observed missense variants, Pro302Leu, Gln322Leu, Arg331Lys, and Val335Ala, are 
      located in the functionally important MEIS2 homeodomain. Pro302Leu is found in the 
      region between helix 1 and helix 2, while the other three are located in the 
      DNA-binding helix 3. To our knowledge, these are the first described de novo 
      missense variants in MEIS2, expanding the known mutation spectrum of the newly 
      recognized human disorder caused by aberrations in this gene.

TI  - Socio-cognitive understanding: a strength or weakness in Down's syndrome?
PG  - 996-1005
AB  - BACKGROUND: Social understanding is often thought to be relatively 'protected' in 
      children with Down's syndrome (DS) and to underlie the outgoing personality 
      characteristically attributed to them. This paper draws together findings from our 
      studies of behaviours during object concept testing, generally considered a 
      theoretically 'pure' measure of early cognitive ability, and from more recent work 
      focusing on two key socio-cognitive skills: recognising facial expressions of 
      emotion and collaborative learning. Age range of children studied was 4 months to 18 
      years. METHODS: Using standardised hiding tasks, object concept ability was assessed 
      cross-sectionally and longitudinally in children with DS and in age- or 
      stage-matched typically developing (TD) children. Stability of cognitive advances 
      was assessed and similarities/differences in developmental pathways explored. In the 
      emotion recognition studies, the ability to distinguish six primary emotions was 
      measured, with performance compared with that of developmentally-matched TD children 
      and age-matched children with intellectual disabilities of similar severity but 
      differing aetiology [non-specific intellectual disability (NSID) or fragile X 
      syndrome (FXS)]. In the collaborative learning study, the impact on sorting skills 
      of working with a peer on a conceptually related task was measured, with outcomes 
      compared in DS, NSID and TD child pairings. RESULTS: Evidence of counterproductive, 
      socially-based strategies being inappropriately applied by children with DS in 
      learning contexts was found in both the object concept and collaborative learning 
      studies, along with inefficient use of current cognitive and linguistic abilities. 
      Emotion recognition weaknesses were also identified, although deficits were relative 
      rather than absolute and individual variability was marked. CONCLUSIONS: In line 
      with emerging evidence from other research teams, findings suggest possible 
      difficulties in some core aspects of interpersonal functioning in DS, with both 
      qualitative and quantitative differences in how social cognition develops and is 
      applied in learning contexts. Implications for development and for behavioural 
      phenotype theory are briefly discussed.

TI  - Creatine transporter defect diagnosed by proton NMR spectroscopy in males with 
      intellectual disability.
PG  - 2446-52
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.a.34208 [doi]
AB  - Creatine deficiency syndrome due to mutations in X-linked SLC6A8 gene results in 
      nonspecific intellectual disability (ID). Diagnosis cannot be established on 
      clinical grounds and is often based on the assessment of brain creatine levels by 
      magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Considering high costs of MRS and necessity 
      of sedation, this technique cannot be used as a first level-screening test. 
      Likewise, gene test analysis is time consuming and not easily accessible to all 
      laboratories. In this article feasibility of urine analysis (creatine/creatinine 
      (Cr/Crn) ratio) performed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) as a first 
      level-screening test is explored. Before running a systematic selection of cases a 
      preliminary study for further molecular analysis is shown. NMR urine spectra (n = 
      1,347) of male patients with an ID without a clinically recognizable syndrome were 
      measured. On the basis of abnormal Cr/Crn ratio, three patients with the highest 
      values were selected for molecular analysis. A confirmatory second urine test was 
      positive in two patients and diagnosis was further confirmed by a decreased brain 
      creatine level and by SLC6A8 gene analysis. A de novo mutation was identified in 
      one. Another patient inherited a novel mutation from the mother who also has a mild 
      ID. A repeat urine test was negative in the third patient and accordingly creatine 
      level in the brain and SLC6A8 gene analysis both gave a normal result. We conclude 
      that Cr/Crn ratio measured by NMR for male patients represents a rapid and useful 
      first level screening test preceding molecular analysis.

TI  - Emotion recognition by children with Down syndrome: investigation of specific 
      impairments and error patterns.
PG  - 378-92
AB  - The ability of children with Down syndrome to recognize expressions of emotion was 
      compared to performance in typically developing and nonspecific intellectual 
      disability groups matched on either MA or a performance-related measure. Our goal 
      was to (a) resolve whether specific emotions present recognition difficulties; (b) 
      investigate patterns of errors; and (c) explore the relationships among 
      emotion-recognition ability and cognitive, linguistic, and adaptive behavior levels. 
      Emotion-recognition ability in the Down syndrome group was significantly poorer than 
      in the typically developing group overall, particularly for fearful expressions. 
      Error patterns and relationships between task performance and assessment measures 
      also differed across groups. Findings are consistent with a neurological explanation 
      of specific deficits in sociocognitive functioning in children with Down syndrome.

TI  - [Pleural effusion associated with long-term dantrolene administration in three 
      patients with severe motor and intellectual disabilities].
PG  - 39-43
AB  - Chronic unilateral pleural effusion developed in three patients with severe motor 
      and intellectual disabilities. All patients received 5-15 years of dantrolene 
      administration for their spasticity. The cause of pleural effusion was indistinct, 
      despite close investigations for etiologies such as infection or tumor. The pleural 
      fluid consisted of sterile exudate in all patients. One patient had eosinophilia in 
      his pleural fluid, while peripheral blood eosinophilia was seen in the other two. 
      The pleural biopsy and autopsy specimens revealed only non-specific inflammatory 
      findings. After dantrolene therapy was discontinued, pleural effusion almost 
      disappeared in two patients in the following several months, but the other died of 
      multi-organ failure from another underlying disease. It is important to take 
      chemical pleurisy into consideration when dealing with pleural effusion of unknown 
      etiology. Moreover, respiratory side effect should be examined in patients treated 
      with chronic dantrolene administration.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Few case controlled studies have been published on the behavioural 
      phenotype of Angelman syndrome (AS). Little is yet known about preferences in 
      individuals with AS. METHOD: Preferences for water-related items and 
      non-water-related items were assessed in 27 individuals with AS and two matched 
      groups of participants, one with Down syndrome (DS) and the other with non-specific 
      intellectual disabilities (NS), using an adapted Dutch version of the Choice 
      Assessment Scale (Matson et al., 1999). RESULTS: Individuals with AS showed a higher 
      preference for water-related items compared to individuals in both comparison 
      groups, substantiating previous reports which have suggested that individuals with 
      AS are fascinated with water. CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge about preferences in 
      individuals with AS, especially with regard to water-related objects and activities, 
      is important in person-centred planning of daytime activities and training programs 
      for this group.

TI  - Collaborative learning: comparison of outcomes for typically developing children and 
      children with intellectual disabilities.
PG  - 361-74
AB  - Collaborative learning is widely used in mainstream education but rarely utilized 
      with children who have intellectual disabilities, possibly on the assumption that 
      the metacognitive skills on which it capitalizes are less likely to be available. 
      Effects of collaborative learning experience on a core cognitive skill, sorting by 
      category, were investigated in three child groups: typically developing (TD) 
      children, children with nonspecific intellectual disabilities (NSID) and children 
      with Down syndrome (DS). Following collaboration, sorting performance improved 
      significantly in lower ability partners in TD-TD pairings, with this pattern 
      reversed in NSID-NSID pairings. Neither partner improved significantly in DS-NSID 
      pairings, suggesting that the sociability attributed to children with DS did not 
      necessarily support either their or their partner's learning in this social context.

TI  - Longitudinal changes in ultrasound measurements: a parallel study in subjects with 
      genetic disorders and healthy controls.
PG  - 409-13
AB  - Disturbances in skeletal status in subjects with genetic disorder may increase their 
      fracture risk. The aim of the study was longitudinal observation of phalangeal speed 
      of sound changes across the bone over a period of 2 y in 24 patients (14 boys and 10 
      girls, mean age 9.63 +/- 1.8 y.) and 24 age-matched healthy controls (14 boys and 10 
      girls, mean age 9.65 +/- 1.71 y.). Weight and height did not differ between patients 
      and controls at baseline and follow-up. Patients with the following disorders were 
      evaluated: 7 with Down syndrome, 6 nonspecific mental retardations of unknown 
      etiology, 5 Martin-Bell syndrome and 6 with other diseases. In patients and 
      controls, no factors potentially influencing bone metabolism (except for genetic 
      disorder) were present. Bone status was assessed by quantitative ultrasound at hand 
      phalanges using DBM Sonic 1200 (IGEA, Carpi, Italy), which measures 
      amplitude-dependent speed of sound (Ad-SoS [m/s]). At baseline, Ad-SoS and Z-score 
      were significantly lower in patients than in controls (1892 +/- 51 m/s versus 1936 
      +/- 43 m/s, p < 0.01 and -1.47 +/- 1.43 versus -0.14 +/- 1.04, p < 0.001, 
      respectively. In follow-up, Ad-SoS and Z-score increased significantly in patients 
      (1892 +/- 51 m/s to 1934 +/- 48 m/s, p < 0.0001 and -1.47 +/- 1.43 to -0.76 +/- 
      1.00, p < 0.01, respectively) and in controls (1936 +/- 43 m/s to 1976 +/- 60 m/s 
      and -0.14 +/- 1.04 to 0.31 +/- 1.08, p < 0.05, respectively). Follow-up Ad-SoS and 
      Z-Score were significantly lower in patients (p < 0.01). Longitudinal changes in 
      Ad-SoS, Z-score weight did not differ between patients and control, and height 
      increased more in controls (13.2 +/- 2.8 cm versus 11.4 +/- 5.9 cm, p < 0.05)+). In 
      patients, Ad-SoS increased by 42 m/s (2.22%), and in controls increased by 40 m/s 
      (2.07%). Difference in Ad-SoS between patients and controls was 44 m/s at baseline 
      and 42 m/s at follow-up. Using the value of the least significant change (LSC = 20.5 
      m/s), in 16 patients (67%) and in 18 controls (75%) Ad-SoS showed an increase 
      greater than the LSC, in one control (4%) a decrease greater than the LSC and in 
      rest of subjects studied remained unchanged (33% patients and 19% controls) over a 
      period of observation. In conclusion, despite comparable improvement in measured 
      ultrasound parameter in patients and controls observed over a study duration, the 
      difference between them remained stable.

TI  - Healthcare costs of intellectual disability in the Netherlands: a cost-of-illness 
      perspective.
PG  - 168-78
AB  - Healthcare costs are continuously increasing, and impose a strong responsibility on 
      governments for an adequate allocation of resources among healthcare provisions and 
      patients. The aims of the present study were to describe the healthcare costs of 
      intellectual disability (ID) and other mental disorders in the context of the total 
      costs of all other diseases, and to determinate the future need of healthcare 
      resources, especially for ID and mental disorders. The present authors performed a 
      top-down cost-of-illness study comprising all healthcare costs of the Netherlands in 
      1994. Data on healthcare use were obtained for all 22 healthcare sectors, and used 
      to ascribe costs to disease groups, age and sex. Costs of mental disorders are by 
      far the largest in the Dutch healthcare system. Some 25.8% of total disease-specific 
      costs could be ascribed to mental disorders: psychiatric conditions, 10.6%; ID, 
      9.0%; and dementia, 6.2%. There are large differences between age and sex groups. 
      The costs of ID and schizophrenia are higher among men, and the costs of dementia 
      and depression are higher among women. The age pattern shows two peaks: the first 
      occurs at 25-35 years of age (ID and psychiatric conditions); and the second at 
      75-85 years of age (dementia). Time trends between 1988 and 1994 show an average 
      annual growth rate of 5.2% for total healthcare costs: psychiatric conditions, 4.8%; 
      ID, 5.4%; and dementia, 9.4%. Demographic projections suggest a less-than-average 
      cost increase for ID and psychiatric disorders (with annual growth rates of 0.2% and 
      0.4%, respectively) compared to the costs of dementia and total healthcare (with 
      annual growth rates of 1.6% and 0.9%, respectively). Intellectual disability and 
      mental disorders represent a large part of healthcare use in the Netherlands. The 
      costs will inevitably increase because of the ageing of the population and 
      increasing life expectancy among people with disabilities. Non-specific cost 
      containment measures may endanger the quality of care for vulnerable people at 
      younger and older ages.

TI  - Genetic study of Welsh gypsies.
PG  - 172-6
AB  - A South Wales gypsy kindred of Romany origin had a high incidence of phenylketonuria 
      along with other recessively inherited disorders. There was a high degree of 
      consanguinity (F = 0-017) with an excess of non-specific mental subnormality among 
      known consanguineous matings. Phenylketonuria and a number of other recessively 
      inherited disorders have been recorded from other Romany gypsy populations, but it 
      is uncertain whether this results from a generally high gene frequency for the 
      disorders or from consanguinity and other more local factors.

PG  - 352-5
AB  - Other workers have reported preliminary results suggesting that vitamin and mineral 
      supplements might improve the mental performance of mentally retarded children. The 
      current study examined the effect of 20 wk of the suggested supplement on Stanford 
      Binet scores in mentally retarded adults with nonspecific diagnoses, Down's 
      syndrome, and subjects receiving anticonvulsant medication. No improvement in 
      Stanford Binet scores was observed. However, serum pyridoxal phosphate 
      concentrations were significantly (p less than 0.05) increased in subjects with 
      Down's syndrome receiving the supplement compared with subjects with nonspecific 
      diagnoses receiving the same treatment thus providing further evidence of abnormal 
      vitamin B6 metabolism in Down's syndrome.

PG  - 94-100
LID - 10.1016/j.ejmg.2009.02.006 [doi]
AB  - Interstitial deletions of 7q11.23 cause Williams-Beuren syndrome, one of the best 
      characterized microdeletion syndromes. The clinical phenotype associated with the 
      reciprocal duplication however is not well defined, though speech delay is often 
      mentioned. We present 14 new 7q11.23 patients with the reciprocal duplication of the 
      Williams-Beuren syndrome critical region, nine familial and five de novo. These were 
      identified by either array-based MLPA or by array-CGH/oligonucleotide analysis in a 
      series of patients with idiopathic mental retardation with an estimated population 
      frequency of 1:13,000-1:20,000. Variable speech delay is a constant finding in our 
      patient group, confirming previous reports. Cognitive abilities range from normal to 
      moderate mental retardation. The association with autism is present in five patients 
      and in one father who also carries the duplication. There is an increased incidence 
      of hypotonia and congenital anomalies: heart defects (PDA), diaphragmatic hernia, 
      cryptorchidism and non-specific brain abnormalities on MRI. Specific dysmorphic 
      features were noted in our patients, including a short philtrum, thin lips and 
      straight eyebrows. Our patient collection demonstrates that the 7q11.23 
      microduplication not only causes language delay, but is also associated with 
      congenital anomalies and a recognizable face.

TI  - Genetic localisation of MRX27 to Xq24-26 defines another discrete gene for 
      non-specific X-linked mental retardation.
PG  - 121-4
AB  - A large family with non-specific X-linked mental retardation (MRX) was first 
      described in 1991 [Glass et al., 1991], with a suggestion of linkage to Xq26-27. The 
      maximum lod score was 1.60 (theta = 0.10) with the F9 locus. The localisation of 
      this MRX gene has now been established by linkage to microsatellite markers. Peak 
      pairwise lod scores of 4.02 and 4.01 (theta = 0.00) were attained at the DXS1114 and 
      DXS994 loci respectively. This MRX gene is now designated MRX27 and is localised to 
      Xq24-26 by recombination events detected by DXS424 and DXS102. This regional 
      localisation spans 26.2 cM on the genetic background map and defines another 
      distinct MRX interval by linkage to a specific region of the X chromosome.

TI  - A novel missense variant in RBM10 can cause a mild form of TARP syndrome with 
      developmental delay and dysmorphic features.
PG  - 606-612
LID - 10.1111/cge.13835 [doi]
AB  - RBM10, is an RNA binding protein that is important for development by regulating the 
      expression of multiple genes. RBM10 is on the X chromosome, and nonsense and 
      frameshift RBM10 variants cause TARP syndrome in males. In a 4-year-old male, we 
      identified a novel maternally inherited missense RBM10 variant in the RRM2 RNA 
      binding domain, c.965C>T, p.Pro322Leu. His clinical features included intellectual 
      disability, developmental delay, growth restriction, hypotonia, and craniofacial 
      malformations. These features were much milder than those described in previously 
      reported cases of TARP syndrome. By in vitro assays, we found that the mutant 
      p.Pro322Leu RBM10 protein retained its specific RNA binding capacity, while gaining 
      a low-affinity nonspecific RNA binding. It was normally localized to the nucleus, 
      but its expression level was significantly reduced with a significantly short 
      half-life. These results indicated that the p.Pro322Leu missense variant causes a 
      developmental disorder in humans through a unique loss-of-function mechanism.

TI  - Interstitial 22q13 deletions: genes other than SHANK3 have major effects on 
      cognitive and language development.
PG  - 1301-10
LID - 10.1038/ejhg.2008.107 [doi]
AB  - The severe mental retardation and speech deficits associated with 22q13 terminal 
      deletions have been attributed in large part to haploinsufficiency of SHANK3, which 
      maps to all 22q13 terminal deletions, although more proximal genes are assumed to 
      have minor effects. We report two children with interstitial deletions of 22q13 and 
      two copies of SHANK3, but clinical features similar to the terminal 22q13 deletion 
      syndrome, including mental retardation and severe speech delay. Both these 
      interstitial deletions are completely contained within the largest terminal 
      deletion, but do not overlap with the nine smallest terminal deletions. These 
      interstitial deletions indicate that haploinsufficiency for 22q13 genes other than 
      SHANK3 can have major effects on cognitive and language development. However, the 
      relatively mild speech problems and normal cognitive abilities of a parent who 
      transmitted her identical interstitial deletion to her more severely affected son 
      suggests that the phenotype associated with this region may be more variable than 
      terminal deletions and therefore contribute to the relative lack of correlation 
      between clinical severity and size of terminal deletions. The phenotypic similarity 
      between the interstitial deletions and non-overlapping small terminal 22q13 
      deletions emphasizes the general nonspecificity of the clinical picture of the 22q13 
      deletion syndrome and the importance of molecular analysis for diagnosis.

TI  - Neonatal screening for metabolic and endocrine disorders.
PG  - 231-6
AB  - The impact of metabolic diseases (inborn errors of metabolism) and endocrine 
      disorders in pediatrics has markedly increased during the last few decades. Critical 
      periods in the development of the central nervous system need special attention in 
      children with these disorders. Early diagnosis and treatment are important in order 
      to prevent mental retardation and serious handicaps in some of these patients. 
      Certain patients with metabolic and endocrine disorders lack early clinical symptoms 
      or have so non-specific signs that permanent neurological handicaps are present when 
      the patients are finally diagnosed. One way to identify these patients is by means 
      of mass screening. A blood sample is then collected from every newborn infant and 
      analyzed for abnormal levels of metabolites or hormones. It is possible to detect at 
      least thirty different disorders in this way. In most European countries screening 
      programmes involve phenylketonuria (PKU) and congenital hypothyroidism. The 
      prognosis for these patients has improved dramatically after the introduction of 
      screening. The Swedish neonatal metabolic screening programme was started in 1965 by 
      screening for PKU. Subsequently, screening for galactosemia and congenital 
      hypothyroidism was added. The result of the screening programme 1965-1985 is as 
      follows: (table; see text) The main benefit of early detection and treatment of 
      children with PKU, congenital hypothyroidism and galactosemia is the prevention of 
      mental retardation and other handicaps. Recently nationwide pilot screening for 
      congenital adrenal hyperplasia (adrenogenital syndrome) was started.

TI  - Gonadal mosaicism in ARID1B gene causes intellectual disability and dysmorphic 
      features in three siblings.
PG  - 156-61
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.a.37405 [doi]
AB  - The gene encoding the AT-rich interaction domain-containing protein 1B (ARID1B) has 
      recently been shown to be one of the most frequently mutated genes in patients with 
      intellectual disability (ID). The phenotypic spectrums associated with variants in 
      this gene vary widely ranging for mild to severe non-specific ID to Coffin-Siris 
      syndrome. In this study, we evaluated three children from a consanguineous Emirati 
      family affected with ID and dysmorphic features. Genomic DNA from all affected 
      siblings was analyzed using CGH array and whole-exome sequencing (WES). Based on a 
      recessive mode of inheritance, homozygous or compound heterozygous variants shared 
      among all three affected children could not be identified. However, further analysis 
      revealed a heterozygous variant (c.4318C>T; p.Q1440*) in the three affected children 
      in an autosomal dominant ID causing gene, ARID1B. This variant was absent in 
      peripheral blood samples obtained from both parents and unaffected siblings. 
      Therefore, we propose that the most likely explanation for this situation is that 
      one of the parents is a gonadal mosaic for the variant. To the best of our 
      knowledge, this is the first report of a gonadal mosaicism inheritance of an ARID1B 
      variant leading to familial ID recurrence.

TI  - Neuropsychological studies in families with fragile-X negative X-linked mental

PG  - 505-9
AB  - Neuropsychological studies were performed in 82 subjects of 12 families with 
      x-linked, fragile X negative, mental retardation (MR). Subjects were examined with 
      Wechsler tests (WPPSI, WISC-R or WAIS, according to their capabilities), Progressive 
      Matrices, Bender or Santucci and memory tests. Physical findings in 5 families were 
      characterised by micro-orchidism (MiO), microcephaly (MiC), short stature (SS) and 
      non-specific facial features (XMR +/- MiO +/- MiC +/- SS). The 11 males with MR had 
      a very low IQ, ranging from 13 to 37 (mean 21.2 +/- 8.8); this did not constitute a 
      profile definition. Among the females of their families, 4 had subnormal or 
      borderline IQ, respectively 74, 66, 38 and 37. A second group (2 families) had MiO 
      but with normal stature and occipito-frontal circumference (XMR +/- MiO). The 7 
      males with MR had an IQ ranging from 24 to 43 (mean 35.1 +/- 5.8) and showed 
      frequently better results in performance than in verbal subtests. In these 2 
      families, 5 females had subnormal or borderline IQ, respectively 77, 72, 71, 70 and 
      20. In the 5 families of the third group, XMR +/- MaO (fraX-), several affected 
      males had macro-orchidism (MaO) and facial changes similar to those of fragile X 
      syndrome. IQ variability, also in the same family (e.g.: the 3 brothers of family 3 
      had, respectively, an IQ of 26, 28 and 68; and 2 brothers of family 1 had an IQ of 
      13 and 63) and different profiles. Two females were severely affected (IQ 16 and 
      24), while another 4 had an IQ, respectively, of 63, 69, 71 and 72.

TI  - Molecular characterization of 1q44 microdeletion in 11 patients reveals three 
      candidate genes for intellectual disability and seizures.
PG  - 1633-40
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.a.35423 [doi]
AB  - Patients with a submicroscopic deletion at 1q43q44 present with intellectual 
      disability (ID), microcephaly, craniofacial anomalies, seizures, limb anomalies, and 
      corpus callosum abnormalities. However, the precise relationship between most of 
      deleted genes and the clinical features in these patients still remains unclear. We 
      studied 11 unrelated patients with 1q44 microdeletion. We showed that the deletions 
      occurred de novo in all patients for whom both parents' DNA was available (10/11). 
      All patients presented with moderate to severe ID, seizures and non-specific 
      craniofacial anomalies. By oligoarray-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) 
      covering the 1q44 region at a high resolution, we obtained a critical deleted region 
      containing two coding genes-HNRNPU and FAM36A-and one non-coding gene-NCRNA00201. 
      All three genes were expressed in different normal human tissues, including in human 
      brain, with highest expression levels in the cerebellum. Mutational screening of the 
      HNRNPU and FAM36A genes in 191 patients with unexplained isolated ID did not reveal 
      any deleterious mutations while the NCRNA00201 non-coding gene was not analyzed. 
      Nine of the 11 patients did not present with microcephaly or corpus callosum 
      abnormalities and carried a small deletion containing HNRNPU, FAM36A, and NCRNA00201 
      but not AKT3 and ZNF238, two centromeric genes. These results suggest that HNRNPU, 
      FAM36A, and NCRNA00201 are not major genes for microcephaly and corpus callosum 
      abnormalities but are good candidates for ID and seizures.

TI  - A novel variant of C12orf4 in a consanguineous Armenian family confirms the etiology 
      of autosomal recessive intellectual disability type 66 with delineation of the 
      phenotype.
PG  - e865
LID - 10.1002/mgg3.865 [doi]
LID - e865
AB  - BACKGROUND: Intellectual disability (ID) is a feature of many rare diseases caused 
      by thousands of genes. This genetic heterogeneity implies that pathogenic variants 
      in a specific gene are found only in a small number of patients, and difficulties 
      arise in the definition of prevailing genotype and characteristic phenotype 
      associated with that gene. One of such very rare disorders is autosomal recessive ID 
      type 66 (OMIM #618221) caused by defects in C12orf4. Up to now, six families have 
      been reported with mostly truncating variants. The spectrum of the clinical 
      phenotype was not emphasized in previous reports, and detailed phenotype was not 
      always available from previous patients, especially from large cohort studies. 
      METHODS: Exome sequencing was performed in a consanguineous Armenian family with two 
      affected adult brothers. RESULTS: The patients carry a novel homozygous nonsense 
      C12orf4 variant. The integration of previous data and phenotyping of the brothers 
      indicate that the clinical picture of C12orf4 defects involves hypotonia in infancy, 
      rather severe ID, speech impairment, and behavioral problems such as aggressiveness, 
      unstable mood, and autistic features. Several other symptoms are more variable and 
      less consistent. CONCLUSION: This rather nonsyndromic and nonspecific clinical 
      picture implies that additional patients with C12orf4 defects will likely continue 
      to be identified using the "genotype-first" approach, rather than based on clinical 
      assessment. The phenotype needs further delineation in future reports.

TI  - Methioninemia and myopathy: a new disorder.
PG  - 423-32
AB  - A 7 1/2-year-old girl with hypermethioninemia, myopathy, and mental deficiency (IQ = 
      65) is described. The increased methionine was not associated with deficiency of 
      methionine adenosyltransferase, which was normal or increased in liver, muscle, 
      erythrocytes, and cultured fibroblasts. Methionyl-tRNA synthetase in fibroblasts was 
      normal. The hypermethioninemia and a concurrently increased blood 
      S-adenosylmethionine declined on a diet low in methionine. There was a diffuse, 
      symmetrical, moderate proximal muscle weakness, but muscle atrophy was not 
      discernible, and the deep tendon reflexes were hypoactive but obtainable. 
      Electromyographic abnormalities were not detected. Electron microscopy of muscle 
      revealed 3 to 6 small myelin figures in the region of the I band in nearly every 
      fiber, with occasional myelin figures at other sites also. These myelin figures were 
      more numerous and smaller than those seen accompanying nonspecific myopathies and 
      may reflect a more specific pathological change. Electron microscopy of liver 
      revealed three nonspecific lesions in all hepatocytes: (1) numerous megamitochondria 
      with crystalloid deposit in the matrix; (2) increased numbers of small vesicles of 
      smooth endoplasmic reticulum; and (3) loss of plasma membrane microvilli, with 
      extensive bleb formation and shedding of cytoplasm into Disse's space.

TI  - The 11q -- syndrome.
PG  - 241-6
AB  - An eighth case of terminal deletion of the long arm of chromosome eleven (11q--) is 
      reported to emphasize both the distinctive facies, but otherwise non-specific nature 
      of this disorder, and the female preponderance of affected patients. Growth and 
      mental retardation, congenital heart disease and telecanthus are the other most 
      constant features. The authors' experience with 3 unrelated cases in less than 2 
      years suggests that this syndrome is underdiagnosed.

TI  - Electrodermal orienting activity in children with Down syndrome.
PG  - 51-8
AB  - The elicitation and habituation of electrodermal orienting responses to auditory 
      stimuli of 19 children with Down syndrome and a control group, an age and 
      sex-matched sample of children without mental retardation were compared. Stimuli 
      were ten 2-second 80 dB, 1000 Hz tones followed by a test tone (80 dB, 500 Hz). 
      Children with Down syndrome gave electrodermal orienting responses of a lower 
      amplitude than did the children in the control group. Both groups showed habituation 
      of their responses. No significant differences were found between groups in either 
      skin conductance levels or frequency of nonspecific responses. Overall, children 
      with Down syndrome showed electrodermal hyporesponsivity in their orienting 
      responses to the stimuli.

TI  - Sleep in individuals with Cri du Chat syndrome: a comparative study.
PG  - 704-15

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sleep problems are common in individuals with intellectual disability. 
      Little is known about sleep in children and adults with Cri du Chat syndrome (CDC). 
      METHOD: Sleep was investigated in 30 individuals with CDC using a sleep 
      questionnaire. Sleep problems and sleep behaviours in individuals with CDC were 
      compared with individuals with non-specific intellectual disabilities (NS) (n = 30) 
      and Down's syndrome (DS) (n = 30). RESULTS: Nine individuals with CDC (i.e. 30%) had 
      a sleep problem, compared with seven individuals with NS (i.e. 23%) and three 
      individuals with DS (i.e. 10%). Though there were few differences between diagnostic 
      groups, night waking problems were most common in CDC. Individuals with CDC 
      frequently showed behaviours related to disordered breathing and poor-quality sleep. 
      Several behaviours related to sleep had a higher occurrence in CDC than in DS (P < 
      0.05) but not in NS. CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded that individuals with CDC do not 
      have an increased probability of sleep problems as compared with other individuals 
      who share similar demographic characteristics. Hypotheses about causes of night 
      waking problems in CDC are generated and suggestions for future research of sleep in 
      individuals with CDC are given.

TI  - Aicardi syndrome: presentation at onset in Swedish children born in 1975-2002.
PG  - 154-8
AB  - In a nation-wide survey of Aicardi syndrome, defined as the onset of epilepsy in the 
      first six months of life, agenesis of the corpus callosum (partial or total) and 
      lacunar chorioretinopathy, 18 patients, all girls, born between 1975 and 2002 were 
      identified in Sweden. Fifteen were definite cases and three were regarded as 
      probable, since they only fulfilled two of three inclusion criteria in addition to 
      other cerebral malformations and/or chorioretinal changes. Calculations based on 
      this survey and population-based studies on epilepsy in retarded children yielded a 
      prevalence rate in the range of 2 - 15 : 100 000 girls. All but one had an ordinary 
      birth weight, length and head circumference for gestational age. One was born 
      preterm, one post term. The age at diagnosis varied from three days to 12 years and 
      decreased during the period reflecting the increased awareness of the syndrome. 
      Eleven came to medical attention because of seizures. Six had myoclonic, four 
      generalized tonic-clonic and eight tonic, clonic or complex partial seizures. One 
      had hypsarrhythmia, five multifocal epileptiform activity, three bilateral 
      independent bursts, two burst-suppression pattern, six other types of spikes and one 
      slowing of background activity. Asymmetrical EEG abnormalities indicating 
      independent hemispheric dysfunction were detected in 13/18 (72 %). Complete absence 
      of the corpus callosum was found in 13/18 (72 %), although not identical with the 
      previous group, a partial defect in 3/18 (17 %), and a thinning in 2/18 (11 %). Of 
      15 children with definite Aicardi syndrome, 13 had binocular and two monocular 
      lacunae. In one of the latter two, subtle monocular lacunae were found on fundus 
      photographs, but had been missed on repeated clinical examinations. Of three 
      children with probable Aicardi syndrome typical lacunae were reported in one and 
      other kinds of depigmentation in the other two. Most of the children had anomalous 
      optic discs. Neuroimaging in infancy or early childhood combined with 
      ophthalmological examination and ocular fundus photography will facilitate an early 
      diagnosis of Aicardi syndrome. Seizure type and EEG abnormalities may be 
      non-specific at onset.

TI  - Expansion of the phenotypic spectrum in three families of methyl CpG-binding protein 
      2 duplication syndrome.
PG  - 73-77
LID - 10.1097/MCD.0000000000000171 [doi]
AB  - The methyl CpG-binding protein 2 duplication syndrome (OMIM #300260) is 
      characterized by hypotonia, developmental delay, spasticity, seizures, and recurrent 
      infections. It is fully penetrant in males and the females can have varied 
      manifestations because of skewed X-inactivation. The size of the duplication can 
      range from 0.2 Mb to over 100 Mb. Around 150 cases have been reported in the 
      literature so far. Here, we report the unusual findings in three cases such as 
      hepatomegaly, ataxia and females with mild intellectual disability that further 
      expand the phenotypic spectrum of this disorder. This paper also stresses the need 
      to perform microarray and/or multiplex ligation probe amplification in all cases of 
      nonspecific intellectual disability.

OAB - Civil libertarians and other conservatives who are interested only in protection 
      against involuntary sterilization argue that a mentally incompetent individual is 
      incapable of ever giving an informed consent. Yet, other liberal thinkers and those 
      who are interested in reproductive freedom for all sexually mature persons maintain 
      that no group of persons should be categorically denied the benefits of 
      sterilization. Rather than clarify, the laws tend to confuse. In most countries, 
      legislation pertaining to voluntary sterilization is nonexistent or nonspecific. 
      Where laws exist, they appear to fall into 3 groups: one group permits consent for 
      surgical treatment to be given by the parents or guardians of incompetent persons 
      without apparent regard to the wishes of the individual; another group considers 
      eugenic sterilization to be legal; and the 3rd group takes into account the 
      probability that there is serious limitation in the capacity of the person concerned 
      to care for a child. In the U.S. 24 states have laws providing for some form of 
      sterilization of persons suffering from mental disorders. The statutes vary in their 
      provisions with some distinguishing between mental illness and mental retardation 
      and others failing to do so. Some laws allow relatives, guardians, physicians, 
      welfare boards or others to initiate sterilization proceedings. Only Colorado allows 
      the mentally retarded individual to petition for his/her own sterilization. The U.S. 
      Department of Health and Human Services was unable satisfactorily to come to terms 
      with the difficult question of sterilization for mentally incompetent persons. The 
      department was not willing to establish a mechanism that would permit some 
      sterilizations under proper safeguards. It chose, instead, to ban all federal funds 
      for programs or projects that would provide sterilization for persons who have been 
      declared mentally incompetent by a court. The department's intention was to protect 
      people from involuntary sterilization, but the unintended effect is also to deny 
      others access to sterilization. From the legal perspective, the most pressing issue 
      is how to ensure that any decision to be sterilized is both informed and 
      unpressured. The purpose and effect of a voluntary sterilization law should be to 
      permit sterilization to be used by all adults who are capable of giving informed 
      consent and who request the procedure. Consent is the central legal issue, and the 
      Association for Voluntary Sterilization model statute authorizes only voluntary 
      sterilization. This model statute permits sterilization after the person requesting 
      it has received counseling and has given consent in writing.

TI  - Nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome and epilepsy.
PG  - 372-6
AB  - Four patients affected with the nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome and recurrent 
      seizures are described and the pertinent literature is reviewed. Three of the 
      patients had multiple basal cell carcinomas and cutaneous nevi, dentigerous cysts, 
      and skeletal anomalies characteristic of the syndrome. The seizures had their onset 
      in childhood and were generalized tonic-clonic in three patients and both 
      tonic-clonic and complex partial in the fourth. Focal neurological deficits were 
      found in only one patient. Pneumoencephalography in two patients and head CT scan in 
      a third were negative. Electroencephalography showed focal spike discharges in one 
      patient, bilateral anterior paroxysmal slowing in another, and nonspecific shifting 
      temporal theta transients in the other two cases. Psychometric testing yielded 
      full-scale scores ranging from 39 to 84. In addition to mental retardation, 
      congenital communicating hydrocephalus, and medulloblastoma, seizures should be 
      included among the neurological manifestations of the nevoid basal cell carcinoma 
      syndrome.

PG  - 1264-1269
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.a.38168 [doi]
AB  - MED13L haploinsufficiency syndrome is a clinical condition manifesting intellectual 
      disability and developmental delay in association with various complications 
      including congenital heart defects and dysmorphic features. Most of the previously 
      reported patients showed de novo loss-of-function mutations in MED13L. Additional 
      three patients with MED13L haploinsufficiency syndrome were identified here in 
      association with rare complications. One patient had a de novo deletion (c.257delT) 
      and T2-weighted high intensity in the occipital white matter on magnetic resonance 
      imaging. Two siblings exhibited an intragenic deletion involving exons 3-14, which 
      led to an in-frame deletion in MED13L. The deletion was inherited from their carrier 
      mother who possessed low frequency mosaicism. The older sister of the siblings 
      showed craniosynostosis; this condition has never been reported in patients with 
      MED13L haploinsufficiency syndrome. Dysmorphic features were observed in these 
      patients; however, most of the findings were nonspecific. Further information would 
      be necessary to understand this clinical condition better.

TI  - Participation in recreation and cognitive activities as a predictor of cognitive 
      performance of adults with/without Down syndrome.
PG  - 955-64
LID - 10.1080/13607863.2015.1047322 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The Cognitive Activity Theory suggests an association between 
      participation in cognitive activities during midlife and cognitive functioning in 
      the short term. We examined the impact of participation in cognitively stimulating 
      activities conveyed during leisure activities on crystallized and fluid tests' 
      performance among adults with intellectual disabilities (ID). METHOD: Adults (n = 
      32; chronological age = 25-55) with non-specific ID and with Down syndrome rated the 
      frequency of their participation in leisure activities. Pursuits included more 
      cognitively involving (reading, participating in academic courses) and less 
      cognitively involving (cooking, dancing) activities. Three judges ranked activities 
      according to their cognitive load on a 1 (few cognitive components) to 5 (many 
      cognitive components) points scale. The findings indicate two new scales: 
      cognitively stimulating activities and recreational stimulating activities. The 
      crystallized battery included phonemic fluency, synonyms, idioms, and verbal 
      metaphors. The fluid battery included the Homophone Meaning Generation Test, 
      Metaphoric Triad Test, Novel Metaphors Test, and Trail Making Test. RESULTS: 
      Hierarchal regression with chronological and mental age, recreational, and 
      cognitively stimulating activities indicated that participation in recreational 
      activities contributed significantly to the explained variance of word fluency. 
      Participation in cognitive activities contributed significantly to the explained 
      variance of most of the crystallized and fluid tests. CONCLUSIONS: The findings 
      support the Cognitive Activity Theory in populations with ID. The findings also 
      support the Compensation Age Theory: not only endogenous factors (age, etiology, IQ 
      level), but also exogenous factors such as life style determining the cognitive 
      functioning of adults with ID. However, frequency and the cognitive load of the 
      activities influenced their cognitive functioning.

TI  - The diagnosis and frequency of X-linked conditions in a cohort of moderately 
      retarded males with affected brothers.
PG  - 713-24
AB  - An epidemiological study was carried out on the group of moderately retarded 
      brothers (IQ, 30-55) identified by Turner and Turner [1974]. Of the original 58 sets 
      of brothers, 54 sets (now 17 to 32 years old) were traced; another four sets (missed 
      in the earlier survey) were added. Forty-five of the 58 pairs were diagnosed as 
      having nonspecific X-linked mental retardation (MR) giving an overall frequency of 
      5.57 moderately retarded males/10,000 male births. In 12 of the 45 families, 
      affected males had the fragile(X) and macroorchidism; six had macroorchidism alone, 
      giving a frequency of 2.8 moderately retarded males with X-linked MR and 
      macroorchidism +/- the fragile(X) per 10,000 males. Corresponding heterozygote 
      frequencies are 7.34 and 3.65/10,000 females respectively. A new subgrouping of 
      nonspecific X-linked mental retardation is described in six families: X-linked MR, 
      macroorchidism without the fragile(X). Three other X-linked conditions were 
      identified: in one family, the Coffin-Lowry syndrome, in another, Duchenne muscular 
      dystrophy, and in two families X-linked MR and muscle atrophy. Half (56%) of the 
      obligatory carriers of fra(X)-MR in this study were dull to mildly retarded. The 
      mildly retarded heterozygotes had a significantly higher percentage of fra(X) 
      expressing lymphocytes as compared to the intellectually normal heterozygotes. When 
      the three types of nonspecific X-linked MR for which population frequencies were 
      calculated were considered together, half of the obligatory carriers (46%) were dull 
      or mildly retarded, thus confirming that this condition is a significant cause of 
      mild intellectual handicap in females.

TI  - Featural versus configural face processing in a rare genetic disorder: Williams 
      syndrome.
PG  - 1034-42
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2788.2011.01426.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Williams syndrome (WMS) is a rare genetic disorder with an estimated 
      prevalence of 1 in 20 000 live births. Among other characteristics, WMS has a 
      distinctive cognitive profile with spared face processing and language skills that 
      contrasts with impairment in the cognitive domains of spatial cognition, problem 
      solving and planning. It remains unclear whether individuals with WMS process faces 
      using a featural strategy that focuses on features or a configural strategy that 
      takes into consideration the contour of a face and spatial relations between 
      features. METHODS: To investigate face processing in WMS, the tasks specifically 
      probe unfamiliar face matching by using a design that includes manipulations in face 
      presentation (thatcherised and non-thatcherised), face orientation (upright and 
      inverted) and face valence (happy and neutral expression) in a match-to-target face 
      recognition design. The sample consisted of 20 participants with WMS, 10 
      participants with non-specific developmental delay (IQ-matched) and 10 normal 
      control participants (chronological age-matched). RESULTS: Similar to normal 
      controls, WMS performed best when faces were presented upright. The results show 
      while the WMS group did not perform as well as their typically developing 
      counterparts, they did significantly better than the IQ-matched developmentally 
      delayed group. WMS did not show an accuracy advantage for inverted faces commonly 
      understood as an index for featural face processing, nor did they perform better on 
      thatcherised inverted face conditions whereby featural processing is forced. 
      Furthermore, no accuracy advantage was observed for positively valenced (happy) 
      faces in the WMS group. CONCLUSION: These results are consistent with previous work 
      showing a configural face processing approach in WMS, a strategy that is also 
      utilised by normal controls.

TI  - Understanding of facial expressions of emotion by children with intellectual 
      disabilities of differing aetiology.
PG  - 551-63
AB  - BACKGROUND: Interpreting emotional expressions is a socio-cognitive skill central to 
      interpersonal interaction. Poor emotion recognition has been reported in autism but 
      is less well understood in other kinds of intellectual disabilities (ID), with 
      procedural differences making comparisons across studies and syndromes difficult. 
      This study aimed to compare directly facial emotion recognition skills in children 
      with fragile X syndrome (FXS), Down's syndrome (DS) and non-specific intellectual 
      disability (NSID), contrasting ability and error profiles with those of typically 
      developing (TD) children of equivalent cognitive and linguistic status. METHODS: 
      Sixty children participated in the study: 15 FXS, 15 DS, 15 NSID and 15 TD children. 
      Standardised measures of cognitive, language and socialisation skills were collected 
      for all children, along with measures of performance on two photo-matching tasks: an 
      'identity-matching' task (to control for basic face-processing ability) and an 
      'emotion-matching' task (happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, fear or disgust). 
      RESULTS: Identity-matching ability did not differ across the four child groups. Only 
      the DS group performed significantly more poorly on the emotion-matching task and 
      only in comparison to the TD group, with fear recognition an area of particular 
      difficulty. CONCLUSION: Findings support previous evidence of emotion recognition 
      abilities commensurate with overall developmental level in children with FXS or 
      NSID, but not DS. They also suggest, however, that syndrome-specific difficulties 
      may be subtle and detectable, at least in smaller-scale studies, only in comparison 
      with TD matches, and not always across syndromes. Implications for behavioural 
      phenotype theory, educational interventions and future research are discussed.

AB  - Intellectual Deficiency (ID) is a common neuropsychiatric disorder whose 
      etiopathogenesis still insufficiently understood. In the last decade, several 
      surveys, assessing epidemiologic, clinical and etiologic parameters of ID, have been 
      performed but none of them is realized in a Tunisian population. In this 
      retrospective survey, we propose to study these parameters, in a Tunisian cohort of 
      458 patients with constitutional ID, and to assess our diagnostic strategy. Data 
      analyses, by the SPSS program, reveal a male predominance, a high level of 
      consanguinity, an advanced mean age of patients, a rare frequentation of specialized 
      institutions by the severely affected patients, and a high frequency of familial 
      forms with predominance of the recessive autosomal ones. The study of clinical 
      parameters and investigations' results shows that 72.1% of our patients present a 
      syndromic ID. For these patients, chromosomal anomalies are rarely described, EEG 
      anomalies were usually non-specific in patients without clinical evidence of 
      epilepsy, and brain anomalies are common in patients with severe ID, neurological 
      symptoms or history of seizures. Aetiology is identified in 13.1% of them whereas it 
      is still unknown in 100% of patients with non-specific ID. This study allows us to 
      better characterize, epidemiologically and clinically, the first large Tunisian 
      cohort of patients with ID and to assess our diagnostic strategy in order to propose 
      a revised one that will improve the diagnostic lead, the care chain and the 
      preventive resources of ID.

LID - 10.1002/ajmg.a.34122 [doi]
AB  - Alterations of the Fragile Mental Retardation 2 gene (FMR2, synonym AFF2) can result 
      in non-specific, mild to borderline X-linked intellectual disability (XLID), and 
      behavioral problems. The well-known molecular pathomechanism of this condition, also 
      referred to as FRAXE, is a (CCG)(n) trinucleotide repeat expansion which leads to 
      silencing of the FMR2 gene. However, deletions within the FMR2 gene may also be 
      causative of the disorder. Here, we report on two brothers diagnosed with FRAXE in 
      whom a small deletion in the FMR2 gene was detected by whole genome array 
      comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). The deletion was also present in their 
      clinically healthy mother and maternal uncle who was similarly affected, but not in 
      a healthy older brother of the two patients. Our observation demonstrates that FMR2 
      gene deletions may contribute to the FRAXE phenotype. Therefore, we suggest that 
      screening for FMR2 gene deletions using array CGH should be considered in patients 
      with non-specific XLID and absent trinucleotide expansion.

TI  - Temperament and behaviour problems in young children with Down syndrome at 12, 30, 
      and 45 months.
PG  - 23-9
AB  - Though cross-sectional studies have yielded important information regarding the 
      trajectory of psychopathology in middle childhood and adolescence in Down syndrome, 
      there has been little exploration of maladaptive behaviour in the earliest years of 
      development. In this study, we explore the emergence of maladaptive behaviour in 
      young children with Down syndrome (n=24) and a mental age-matched comparison group 
      (n=33) of young children with developmental disabilities of mixed etiologies. 
      Behavioural data (Bayley Scales of Infant Development, Infant Temperament 
      Questionnaire, Achenbach's Child Behaviour Checklist) were collected for children in 
      each group at 12 months, 30 months, and 45 months. Findings from this study suggest 
      that the onset of internalising behaviour difficulties in young children with Down 
      syndrome may emerge later in early development than in children with developmental 
      disabilities of mixed/nonspecific etiologies. In addition, temperament at Time I 
      appeared to be a much stronger predictor of maladaptive behaviour outcomes at Time 3 
      in the mixed comparison group than in the Down syndrome group. Implications of this 
      trajectory of the early development of maladaptive behaviour in Down syndrome for 
      intervention for young children with Down syndrome are discussed.

TI  - Assessment of deviant arousal in adult male sex offenders with developmental 
      disabilities.
PG  - 173-88
AB  - Ten individuals, residing in a treatment facility specializing in the rehabilitation 
      of sex offenders with developmental disabilities, participated in an arousal 
      assessment involving the use of the penile plethysmograph. The arousal assessments 
      involved measuring change in penile circumference to various categories of stimuli 
      both appropriate (adult men and women) and inappropriate (e.g., 8- to 9-year-old 
      boys and girls). This approach extends the existing assessment literature by the use 
      of repeated measurement and single-subject experimental design. Data from these 
      assessments were analyzed to determine if clear and informative outcomes were 
      obtained. Overall, three general patterns of results emerged. Some participants 
      showed differentiated deviant arousal or higher levels of arousal to specific 
      inappropriate stimuli (deviant is a term used in the existing sex-offender 
      literature to describe this type of arousal). Other participants showed 
      undifferentiated deviant arousal, in which case they showed nonspecific arousal to 
      inappropriate stimuli. The remaining participants showed no arousal to inappropriate 
      stimuli but did show arousal to appropriate stimuli. Implications for assessment, 
      treatment, and future directions are discussed.

TI  - Homozygosity mapping in 64 Syrian consanguineous families with non-specific 
      intellectual disability reveals 11 novel loci and high heterogeneity.
PG  - 1161-6
LID - 10.1038/ejhg.2011.98 [doi]
AB  - Non-specific intellectual disability of autosomal recessive inheritance (NS-ARID) 
      represents an important fraction of severe cognitive dysfunction disorders. To date, 
      only 10 genes have been identified, and further 24 linked-ARID loci have been 
      reported, as well as others with suggestive linkage. To discover novel genes causing 
      NS-ARID, we undertook genome-wide homozygosity mapping in 64 consanguineous 
      multiplex families of Syrian descent. A total of 11 families revealed unique, 
      significantly linked loci at 4q26-4q28 (MRT17), 6q12-q15 (MRT18), 18p11 (MRT19), 
      16p12-q12 (MRT20), 11p15 (MRT21), 11p13-q14 (MRT23), 6p12 (MRT24), 12q13-q15 
      (MRT25), 14q11-q12 (MRT26), 15q23-q26 (MRT27), and 6q26-q27 (MRT28), respectively. 
      Loci ranged between 1.2 and 45.6 Mb in length. One family showed linkage to 
      chromosome 8q24.3, and we identified a mutation in TRAPPC9. Our study further 
      highlights the extreme heterogeneity of NS-ARID, and suggests that no major disease 
      gene is to be expected, at least in this study group. Systematic analysis of large 
      numbers of affected families, as presented here, will help discovering the genetic 
      causes of ID.

LID - 10.1111/dmcn.12334 [doi]
AB  - The phenotype attributed to MECP2 mutations continues to expand. In addition to 
      classic and variant Rett syndrome, phenotypes include non-specific intellectual 
      disability and autism spectrum disorder in females, and fatal neonatal 
      encephalopathy in males. One particular phenotype of parkinsonism, pyramidal signs, 
      and neuropsychiatric symptoms (PPM-X) has been described only in males. We report on 
      the first female with the A140V MECP2 mutation presenting with late onset cognitive 
      regression, pyramidal symptoms, parkinsonism, and bipolar symptoms. This finding 
      emphasizes the need to consider MECP2 sequencing in females with non-classic Rett 
      phenotypes, particularly those with intellectual disability and neuropsychiatric 
      features.

PG  - 643-52
LID - 10.1016/j.ridd.2010.12.005 [doi]
AB  - Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS) is a genetically determined neurodevelopmental 
      disorder caused by a heterozygous deletion of 26-28 genes on chromosome band 
      7q11.23. During the past few years, researchers and clinicians have significantly 
      contributed to define the phenotype of the syndrome, including its cognitive and 
      behavioral aspects. However, it is not well known yet whether the psychological 
      problems are specific to the syndrome or secondary to the intellectual disability 
      (ID). The aim of our study was to better define the psychopathological profile of 
      WBS and whether or not it is related with IQ or anxiety symptoms. Twenty-five 
      subjects (12 girls, 13 boys) with a diagnosis of WBS were compared to 27 boys with 
      Fragile X Syndrome and to 24 boys with ID of non-specific etiology using the Child 
      Behavior Checklist. Anxiety, depression and attention problems were the main 
      behavioral problems found in WBS with no gender differences. Significant differences 
      between cohorts were observed in somatic complaints, delinquent behavior, aggressive 
      behavior, and externalizing problems. Some associations between IQ and anxiety items 
      were found. The findings are discussed in terms of behavioral phenotypes, genetic 
      implications and ID.

TI  - Linguistic abilities in children with Williams-Beuren syndrome.
PG  - 291-6
AB  - In recent studies children with Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS) have been 
      characterized as having a distinct neuropsychological profile with verbal abilities 
      being superior to visuo-spatial and motor skills. An unusual command of language, 
      including excessive use of verbal stereotypes, social phrases, and clichés has been 
      noticed. The aim of this study is to establish whether the quality and quantity of 
      verbal behavior, and the articulation and tonal quality of the voices of children 
      with WBS differ from other children with nonspecific developmental disabilities. A 
      group of 25 children with WBS and a control group of 25 children matched for age 
      (4-10 years), sex (12 girls; 13 boys), and non-verbal reasoning abilities (mean IQ = 
      79) were investigated. The Heidelberg Language Development Test and a picture story 
      were administered. The mothers were asked to answer a questionnaire to assess the 
      articulation and the vocal characteristics of their children. The results show that 
      children with WB syndrome do not differ in most qualitative and quantitative tasks 
      with regard to verbal competence. They produce significantly more correct 
      plural-singular formations than the control children (t = 2.49, P < 0.01) on a 
      primitive level of grammatical competence. In general, their articulation was 
      reported to be more exact and clear (t = -2.73, P < 0.006). More mothers of children 
      with WBS noticed a production of stereotypes, the use of social phrases, and clichés 
      than did mothers of the control children (Chi square = -6.67 P < 0.005). Children 
      with WBS were less likely to lisp as compared to the control children (Chi square = 
      2.08, P = 0.074).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB  - BACKGROUND: Little is known about behavioural flexibility in children and adults 
      with Angelman syndrome and whether people with this syndrome have more or less 
      problems in being behaviourally flexible as compared with other people. METHOD: 
      Behavioural flexibility scores were assessed in 129 individuals with Angelman 
      syndrome using 11 items from the Behavioural Flexibility Rating Scale-Revised (Green 
      et al. 2007). Level of behavioural flexibility scores in individuals with Angelman 
      syndrome (N = 129) was compared with that of people with non-specific intellectual 
      disability (ID) (N = 90), Down syndrome (N = 398) and Autism spectrum disorder (N = 
      235). RESULTS: Comparative analyses show that individuals with Angelman syndrome 
      were more flexible than those with non-specific ID (P < 0.001) and those with Autism 
      spectrum disorder (P < 0.01). There were no differences in behavioural flexibility 
      scores between individuals with Angelman syndrome and those with Down syndrome (P = 
      0.94). CONCLUSION: It is concluded that individuals with Angelman syndrome are 
      comparatively flexible in their behaviour.

TI  - Creatine Transporter Deficiency: Screening of Males with Neurodevelopmental 
      Disorders and Neurocognitive Characterization of a Case.
PG  - 322-6
LID - 10.1097/DBP.0000000000000299 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Creatine transporter deficiency (CTD) is an X-linked, neurometabolic 
      disorder associated with intellectual disability that is characterized by brain 
      creatine (Cr) deficiency and caused by mutations in SLC6A8, the Cr transporter 1 
      protein gene. CTD is identified by elevated urine creatine/creatinine (Cr/Crn) ratio 
      or reduced Cr peak on brain magnetic resonance spectroscopy; the diagnosis is 
      confirmed by decreased Cr uptake in cultured fibroblasts, and/or identification of a 
      mutation in the SLC6A8 gene. Prevalence studies suggest this disorder may be 
      underdiagnosed. We sought to identify cases from a well-characterized cohort of 
      children diagnosed with neurodevelopmental disorders. METHOD: Urine screening for 
      CTD was performed on a cohort of 46 males with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and 9 
      males with a history of non-ASD developmental delay (DD) classified with 
      intellectual disability. RESULTS: We identified 1 patient with CTD in the cohort 
      based on abnormal urine Cr/Crn, and confirmed the diagnosis by the identification of 
      a novel frameshift mutation in the SLC6A8 gene. This patient presented without ASD 
      but with intellectual disability, and was characterized by a nonspecific phenotype 
      of early language delay and DD that persisted into moderate-to-severe intellectual 
      disability, consistent with previous descriptions of CTD. CONCLUSION: Identification 
      of patients with CTD is possible by measuring urine Cr and Crn levels and the 
      current case adds to the growing literature of neurocognitive deficits associated 
      with the disorder that affect cognition, language and behavior in childhood.

TI  - Value of computerised tomography in children with non-specific mental subnormally.
PG  - 381-3
AB  - Seventy-six children had computerized tomography scans as part of an investigation 
      of mental subnormality; most of them are severely retarded and all those over age 5 
      years attend special schools. Seventy-two per cent of the children had normal scans. 
      Twenty per cent showed cerebral atrophy and in only 8% was there a specific 
      abnormality (agenesis of corpus callosum, arachnoid cyst, communicating 
      hydrocephalus). None of these findings had any positive prognostic implication. 
      Sedation or general anaesthesia was required for all except one child. Injection 
      pethidine compound was used for children under age 5 years or less than 30 kg in 
      weight, and trimeprazine orally was used for older children. The radiation exposure 
      was high--5.6 rad per scan, which is 100 times greater than that from a 
      posteroanterior and lateral chest x-ray film. For these reasons computerised 
      tomography scans cannot be recommended as a routine part of the investigation of 
      children with non-specific mental subnormality.

TI  - Working memory training in children with neuropsychiatric disorders and mild to 
      borderline intellectual functioning, the role of coaching; a double-blind randomized 
      controlled trial.
PG  - 114
LID - 10.1186/s12888-017-1274-6 [doi]
LID - 114
AB  - BACKGROUND: Working memory training (WMT) has been shown to offer therapeutic 
      benefits to both patients with Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and 
      patients with mild to borderline Intellectual Disabilities (MBID; 60 < IQ < 85). 
      However, robust evidence for transfer effects and treatment benefits of WMT over 
      placebo training are lacking. Owing to the nature of double-blind research designs 
      in RCTs, children have received non-specific coaching not based on their actual 
      training performance. Active coaching based on individual training results (such as 
      in clinical practice) might enhance the efficacy of Cogmed WMT. Furthermore, 
      clinical experience and the general treatment approach to these vulnerable children 
      has shown that the intensity and duration of WMT is often too stressful. This study 
      therefore investigated the efficacy of a less intensive, but more prolonged Cogmed 
      WMT (including active personalized coaching and feedback) in reducing behavioral 
      symptoms and improving neurocognitive functioning and academic achievements in 
      children with MBID and neuropsychiatric disorders. METHODS/DESIGN: A double-blind 
      RCT with children (age 10.0-13.11) with neuropsychiatric disorders (ADHD and/or 
      autism spectrum disorder (ASD)) and MBID (IQ: 60 < IQ < 85). Two groups (each 
      n = 26) will receive Cogmed WMT (version R/M) at home or at school for 8 weeks, 
      4 days a week, at 30 min a day. One group will receive active personalized coaching 
      and feedback based on their actual individual performance during Cogmed training. 
      The other group will only receive general non-personalized coaching (i.e. no receive 
      personalized coaching and feedback). Both groups will undergo a neurocognitive 
      assessment (working memory, executive functioning, academic achievements) before and 
      after training and complete several questionnaires (behavioral problems, parenting 
      style) with a 6 months follow-up. DISCUSSION: This study will add to the literature 
      since the role of coaching in Cogmed WMT has not been studied before. It will also 
      provide opportunities to investigate an alternative version of WMT in a large group 
      of vulnerable children, for whom few evidence-based treatments are available. 
      Ultimately, this will allow us to advise mental health care professionals and 
      special education schools about the use of this type of intervention for children 
      with MBID and neuropsychiatric disorders. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Dutch Trial Register.

TI  - Clinical, cytogenetic, and molecular characterization of a patient with a de novo 
      interstitial 22q12 duplication.
PG  - 186-90
AB  - We report a 19-year-old woman with minor craniofacial anomalies, mild mental 
      retardation, and foramina parietalia permagna (FPP) (OMIM 168500). Cytogenetic 
      analysis showed a de novo interstitial chromosome 22 long arm duplication. FISH with 
      a panel of chromosome 22q12-q13 bands-specific BAC clones refined the cytogenetic 
      investigation, and restricted the duplicated segment to the q12 region. Mutation 
      analysis of FPP genes identified an insertion mutation in the ALX4 gene (344insC) in 
      the proband and her father with loss of function of the gene. The patient's 
      phenotype is considered in the light of the results of the cytogenetic, FISH, and 
      molecular investigations, and her features are compared with those of other patients 
      with similar duplications. Finally, variable phenotypic findings due to different 
      22q duplicated chromosomal segments are discussed. Our report indicates that 22q12 
      interstitial duplications are associated with craniofacial anomalies and mild mental 
      retardation, while life threatening malformations are usually not present. Although 
      these phenotypic changes are common and non-specific, molecular study of our patient 
      established more precise relationships between clinical findings and 22q duplicated 
      region(s). This approach fosters better counseling of the families of patients with 
      newly diagnosed, similar duplications.

TI  - Visual evoked potentials of mildly mentally retarded and control children.
PG  - 638-45
AB  - Visual evoked potentials (VEPs) were recorded from 25 10- to 13-year-old mildly 
      mentally retarded children and compared with those from 31 control children of the 
      same age-range. Correlations of VEPs with age were weak, but a relationship between 
      VEPs and IQ was demonstrated for the control group. The retarded group had 
      significantly longer latencies and higher amplitude peaks than the control group, 
      with the differences occurring primarily over non-specific cortex and for secondary 
      components. Analysis also showed that the retarded group were neurophysiologically 
      heterogeneous. Since the same children had been analyzed earlier by quantitative EEG 
      methods, comparisons are made with respect to these two methods of investigating 
      brain function.

TI  - Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease in institutionalised intellectually disabled 
      individuals.
PG  - 134-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence of reflux oesophagitis (RO) in the normally intellectual 
      population is about 2%, while this condition in the intellectually disabled has an 
      estimated prevalence of 10%. METHODS: We investigated the presence of RO among 1687 
      intellectually disabled, with an IQ < 50, from 5 different institutes in the 
      Netherlands. All were scored for possible associated factors and reflux symptoms, 
      and compared with the overall population (n = 1580) from the same institutes 
      (controls). Also, the effect of treatment on symptoms was evaluated after at least 
      one year of therapy. RESULTS: Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) was suspected 
      clinically in 169 patients based on the following symptoms: vomiting, haematemesis, 
      anaemia, rumination or behaviour problems. At endoscopy RO was diagnosed in 107 of 
      1687 patients (6.4%): 17 (15.9%) grade I, 34 (31.8%) gr. II, 42 (39.3%) gr. III and 
      14 (13.1%) gr. IV RO (Savary-Miller classification). Cerebral palsy, constipation, 
      anticonvulsant drugs, an IQ < 35, underweight and gastrostomy feeding appeared to be 
      possible associated factors, while as reflux symptoms persistent vomiting, 
      haematemesis, iron deficiency anaemia, rumination, and behaviour problems were 
      found. Concerning therapy, surgery was found to be effective in 38%, H2 receptor 
      antagonists in 60% and the proton-pump inhibitor omeprazole in 96%. CONCLUSIONS: In 
      this group of Dutch intellectually disabled patients with IQ < 50 RO was diagnosed 
      in about 6% (107 of 1687), mostly severe grades of oesophagitis. Several possible 
      associated factors were significantly present. From non-specific reflux symptoms 
      persistent vomiting was the most indicative factor. In this population the most 
      effective treatment of RO was long-term omeprazole therapy.

TI  - Symptomatic Chiari I malformation in Kabuki syndrome.
PG  - 273-5
AB  - Kabuki (Niikawa-Kuroki) syndrome is associated with a characteristic facial 
      appearance, cleft palate, congenital heart defects, and developmental delay. 
      Structural brain anomalies have only occasionally been described in Kabuki syndrome. 
      Chiari type I malformation, characterized by caudal herniation of the cerebellar 
      tonsils through the foramen magnum, has been described only infrequently in 
      association with defined syndromes and has been reported once in association with 
      Kabuki syndrome. We report three additional children with Kabuki syndrome who have 
      Chiari I malformation. Two children presented with chronic headaches and the third 
      patient presented with gait abnormalities in adolescence. The incidence of Chiari I 
      malformation may be higher than previously reported in Kabuki syndrome since it may 
      not be diagnosed until later in childhood, whereas most reports of Kabuki syndrome 
      are of young children. Further, symptoms of Chiari I anomaly can be somewhat 
      nonspecific. Thus, we suggest that Chiari type I be considered in patients with 
      Kabuki syndrome who present with persistent headache, neck pain, or other symptoms 
      suggestive of Chiari I anomaly.

TI  - Partial trisomy and tetrasomy of chromosome 21 without Down Syndrome phenotype and 
      short overview of genotype-phenotype correlation. A case report.
PG  - 321-5
LID - 10.5507/bp.2013.077 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Trisomy of chromosome 21 is associated with Down syndrome (DS) - the commonest 
      genetic cause of mental retardation. We report two unusual cases with partial 
      trisomy of chromosome 21 and tetrasomy of chromosome 21 without DS phenotype. We 
      include a short overview of the genotype-phenotype correlation studies in 
      discussion. METHODS: Conventional chromosomal analysis, fluorescent in situ 
      hybridisation (FISH), quantitative fluorescent PCR (QFPCR) and Nimblegen targeted 
      chromosome 21 array were used for deciphering the genotypes. RESULTS: Conventional 
      chromosomal analysis revealed one extra copy of derivative chromosome 21 in 
      peripheral blood lymphocytes of the patients. FISH and QF PCR analyses identified 
      duplicated loci (D21Z1, D21S1414, D21S1435) spanning from the centromere to band 
      21q21. Nimblegen targeted chromosome 21 array specified the range of duplication 
      from the centromere to the band 21q21.3 (19 Mb) in the first case and the range of 
      duplication and triplication resp from centromere to the bands 21q21.3 (15 Mb) and 
      21q11.2 (4 Mb) resp. in the second case. Additional material was of maternal origin 
      in both cases. The different mechanisms led to the formation of the particular 
      chromosomal imbalances. CONCLUSION: These findings confirm the conclusion of 
      nonpresence of DS when bands 21q22.2 and 21q22.3 (Down critical region) are not 
      duplicated. The patients had nonspecific phenotypes although some of their features 
      such as "sandal gaps", joint hyperlaxity, hypotonia and brachycephaly are present in 
      patients with DS. Our observation can help to narrow the region responsible for DS 
      and to map the loci accountable for minor features of DS.

AB  - A 14-year-old boy with Down syndrome (DS) showed a gradual decline in his daily 
      activities and feeding capacities, and a marked deterioration triggered by a 
      streptococcal infection was observed at the age of 15 years. He became bedridden, 
      accompanied by sleep disturbance, sustained upward gaze, and generalized rigidity. 
      Magnetic resonance imaging showed unremarkable findings, but antiglutamate receptor 
      autoantibodies were positive in his cerebrospinal fluid. Treatment with thiamine 
      infusion and steroid pulse therapy showed little effect, but gross motor dysfunction 
      and appetite loss were ameliorated by the administration of l-DOPA and serotonin 
      reuptake inhibitors. Thereafter, autistic behaviors predominated, including loss of 
      social interaction, oral tendency, water phobia, and aggressiveness. Initiation of 
      donepezil, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, resulted in the disappearance of these 
      symptoms and total recovery of the patient to his previous psychosocial levels. We 
      hypothesize that the acute regression in adolescence represents a process closely 
      related to the defects of serotonergic and cholinergic systems that are innate to DS 
      brains and not just a nonspecific comorbidity of depression or limbic encephalitis.

AB  - Clinical data from 50 mentally retarded (MR) males in nine X-linked MR families, 
      syndromic and non-specific, with mutations (duplication, expansion, missense, and 
      deletion mutations) in the Aristaless related homeobox gene, ARX, were analysed. 
      Seizures were observed with all mutations and occurred in 29 patients, including one 
      family with a novel myoclonic epilepsy syndrome associated with the missense 
      mutation. Seventeen patients had infantile spasms. Other phenotypes included mild to 
      moderate MR alone, or with combinations of dystonia, ataxia or autism. These data 
      suggest that mutations in the ARX gene are important causes of MR, often associated 
      with diverse neurological manifestations.

      together with retinitis pigmentosa. Carrier females are mentally normal but may show 
      signs of the X-linked retinitis pigmentosa carrier state and become symptomatic in 
      their later years. Analysis of polymorphic DNA markers at nine loci on the short arm 
      of the X chromosome shows that no crossing-over occurs between the disease and Xp11 
      markers DXS255, TIMP, DXS426, MAOA, and DXS228. The 90% confidence limits show that 
      the locus is in the Xp21-q21 region. Haplotype analysis is consistent with the 
      causal gene being located proximal to the Xp21 loci DXS538 and 5'-dystrophin on the 
      short arm of the X chromosome. The posterior probability of linkage to the RP2 
      region of the X chromosome short arm (Xp11.4-p11.23) is .727, suggesting the 
      possibility of a contiguous-gene-deletion syndrome. No cytogenetic abnormality has 
      been identified.

TI  - Locomotor strategies before independent walking: prospective study of 50 mentally 
      retarded children.
PG  - 334-41
AB  - To investigate the association between pre-walking locomotor strategies and 
      psychomotor developments in children with mental retardation (MR), 50 children with 
      non-specific MR were included in this study. There were 29 boys and 21 girls, 96% of 
      whom had moderate to severe MR. They were followed from 4-53 months to 25-99 months 
      of age, and their follow-up periods ranged from 10 to 48 months (mean 30 months). 
      According to the pre-walking locomotor strategies, these children were categorized 
      into three groups: the crawling group (n = 34) who used crawling or creeping as 
      their main locomotion pattern before independent walking; the shuffling group (n = 
      9) who used shuffling prior to independent walking; and the direct-walking group (n 
      = 7) who did not have any other locomotor strategies except rolling. In almost all 
      motor developmental milestones, children in the direct-walking group developed 
      earlier than those in the crawling and shuffling groups. Children in the crawling 
      group had more advanced developments than those in the shuffling group. The 
      difference in the mean ratio developmental quotients of the Bayley Mental Scale 
      among the three groups was not significant. The present study showed that crawling 
      may not be a necessary prerequisite for early ambulation or better cognitive 
      function in MR children.

      autosomal-recessive intellectual disability.

LID - S0002-9297(13)00116-X [pii]

AB  - PGAP2 encodes a protein involved in remodeling the glycosylphosphatidylinositol 
      (GPI) anchor in the Golgi apparatus. After synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum 
      (ER), GPI anchors are transferred to the proteins and are remodeled while 
      transported through the Golgi to the cell membrane. Germline mutations in six genes 
      (PIGA, PIGL, PIGM, PIGV, PIGN, and PIGO) in the ER-located part of the 
      GPI-anchor-biosynthesis pathway have been reported, and all are associated with 
      phenotypes extending from malformation and lethality to severe intellectual 
      disability, epilepsy, minor dysmorphisms, and elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP). 
      We performed autozygosity mapping and ultra-deep sequencing followed by stringent 
      filtering and identified two homozygous PGAP2 alterations, p.Tyr99Cys and 
      p.Arg177Pro, in seven offspring with nonspecific autosomal-recessive intellectual 
      disability from two consanguineous families. Rescue experiments with the altered 
      proteins in PGAP2-deficient Chinese hamster ovary cell lines showed less expression 
      of cell-surface GPI-anchored proteins DAF and CD59 than of the wild-type protein, 
      substantiating the pathogenicity of the identified alterations. Furthermore, we 
      observed a full rescue when we used strong promoters before the mutant cDNAs, 
      suggesting a hypomorphic effect of the mutations. We report on alterations in the 
      Golgi-located part of the GPI-anchor-biosynthesis pathway and extend the phenotypic 
      spectrum of the GPI-anchor deficiencies to isolated intellectual disability with 
      elevated ALP. GPI-anchor deficiencies can be interpreted within the concept of a 
      disease family, and we propose that the severity of the phenotype is dependent on 
      the location of the altered protein in the biosynthesis chain.

TI  - Stress and coping in families of children with Smith-Magenis syndrome.
PG  - 331-40
AB  - To describe stress and coping in families of children with Smith-Magenis syndrome, 
      the present authors interviewed and received questionnaires from families of 36 
      children with this disorder. For measures of total stress, and of parent and family 
      problems, the best predictors were the family's number of friends and the child's 
      degree of impairment on the Vineland socialization domain; the single best predictor 
      of parental pessimism was the child's degree of maladaptive behaviour. Although the 
      stress levels of the families of children with Smith-Magenis syndrome are comparable 
      to the levels shown by the families of children with Prader-Willi and 5p- syndromes, 
      these levels are much higher than the stress levels reported by families of children 
      with mixed or non-specific developmental disabilities. Stress levels may be similar 
      across aetiologies involving high levels of maladaptive behaviour, but the 
      correlates of family stress--particularly the moderating role of family 
      friends--seem specific to Smith-Magenis syndrome.

PG  - 1773-9

AB  - The prevalence of sleep problems in individuals with intellectual disability (ID) 
      seems to vary between genetic syndromes associated with ID. Different types of sleep 
      disturbances may indicate underlying causes of sleep problems and these types of 
      sleep disturbances may vary between different genetic syndromes. We examined and 
      compared five types of sleep disturbance as well as severity of sleep problems in 
      individuals with Cri du Chat syndrome (CDC), Down's syndrome (DS), Jacobsen syndrome 
      (JS), and individuals with non-specific ID (NS). We used Simonds and Parraga's Sleep 
      Questionnaire (1982) to assess prevalence of types of sleep disturbance and to 
      explore differences in types of sleep disturbance and severity of sleep problems 
      between the four diagnostic groups. In each group, mean scores for Snoring were 
      significantly higher than those for Sleep apnea and Snoring was the most prevalent 
      type of sleep disturbance in CDC, DS, and JS. The mean score on Complaints related 
      to sleep was remarkably high in the JS group. There were no differences in severity 
      of sleep problems between groups. These findings suggest that snoring is an 
      important underlying cause of sleep problems in individuals with CDS, DS, and JS.

TI  - Specific clinical and brain MRI features in mentally retarded patients with 
      mutations in the Oligophrenin-1 gene.
PG  - 364-71
AB  - Oligophrenin-1 (OPHN-1) gene disruption is known as responsible for so called 
      "non-specific" X-linked mental retardation (MR) Billuart et al. [1998: Nature 
      392:923-926]. In order to search for a possible specific clinical and radiological 
      profile for mutation in the OPHN-1 gene, clinical and 3D brain MRI studies were 
      performed in the two families with a known mutation in OPHN-1 reported so far: a 
      19-year-old female with an X;12 balanced translocation encompassing OPHN-1, and four 
      affected males of family MRX60 sharing a frameshift mutation in OPHN-1. Clinical 
      data shared by affected individuals were neonatal hypotonia with motor delay but no 
      obvious ataxia, marked strabismus, early onset complex partial seizures, and 
      moderate to severe MR. Brain MRIs performed in three individuals exhibited a 
      specific vermian dysgenesis including an incomplete sulcation of anterior and 
      posterior vermis with the most prominent defect in lobules VI and VII. In addition, 
      a non-specific cerebral cortico-subcortical atrophy was also observed. These 
      clinical and radiological features suggest a distinct clinico-radiological syndrome. 
      These preliminary data need to be confirmed in other families and will be helpful 
      for further targeted mutation screening of the OPHN-1 gene in male patients with 
      similar clinico-radiological features. In addition, OPHN-1 inactivation should be 
      considered as a relevant model of developmental vermis disorganization, leading to a 
      better understanding of the possible role of the cerebellum in MR.

      information processing in Raven matrices performance among individuals with 
      intellectual disability with that of their typically developed (TD) counterparts. 
      Twenty-three adults with non-specific intellectual disability (NSID), 15 adults with 
      Down syndrome (DS) and 35 children with TD matched for mental age, participated. 
      Participants solved the Raven's Colored Progressive Matrices and five items from the 
      Raven Standard Progressive Matrices while having their eye movements monitored. The 
      overall percent of correct answers was significantly higher for the TD group 
      compared to two ID group. Comparison of the eye movement pattern of each group 
      indicated that the TD group spent more time on the matrices before shifting to the 
      options, than the two ID groups. The TD group made significantly less switches from 
      one rejoins to another, than the ID groups. The difference in the scanning pattern 
      between the TD and the ID groups is interpreted as a reflection of two different 
      types of strategies, Constructive matching and Response elimination, respectively. 
      There were no differences in eye scanning between participants with NSID and those 
      with DS.

AB  - A pathological study of the lenses of 21 patients with Down's syndrome disclosed no 
      distinctive abnormalities of the lens capsule, as had been reported previously. Five 
      patients, 15 years of age or older, had focal cortical changes consistent with the 
      characteristic flake-like opacities seen in patients with Down's syndrome after the 
      first decade of life. Three patients with more extensive, visually significant lens 
      opacities showed nonspecific cataractous changes. No abnormalities other than 
      pathological artifacts were seen in the lenses of patients younger than 15 years of 
      age.

AB  - Alpha-thalassemia X-linked intellectual disability (ATRX) syndrome is a genetic 
      syndrome caused by mutation of the ATRX gene associated with chromatin remodeling. 
      Recently, a wide spectrum of brain MRI abnormalities and clinical manifestations has 
      been recognized. We describe two male patients with genetically confirmed ATRX 
      syndrome, both presented with developmental delay and white matter changes without 
      typical clinical characteristics of ATRX. Whole-exome sequencing revealed the 
      presence of ATRX mutations: a novel c.6472A>G mutation in Case 1 and a previously 
      reported c.6532C>T mutation in Case 2. These two cases expanded the genetic and 
      clinical spectrum of ATRX syndrome, including brain MRI abnormalities. Our results 
      suggest that male patients with developmental delay and widespread white matter 
      changes, even without distinctive facial dysmorphism and hematologic abnormalities, 
      should be suspected as ATRX syndrome. We support the clinical utility of whole-exome 
      sequencing, particularly in ultra-rare neurological diseases with nonspecific 
      developmental disabilities and atypical presentation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This investigation details procedures used to teach enhanced natural 
      gestures (ENGs) and illustrates its use with three students with Angelman syndrome 
      (AS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Themes were extracted, using a process of content 
      analysis, to organize individuals' feedback pertaining to previous versions of the 
      instructional programme. A 'B' case study design was then employed to follow 
      administration of the modified programme with three students in Madrid, Spain. 
      Programme impact was examined relative to changes in each student's uses of ENGs 
      spontaneously and in response to non-specific verbal prompts, along with team 
      members' responses to a questionnaire designed to evaluate programme efficacy. 
      RESULTS: Two of the three students demonstrated particularly rapid and spontaneous 
      uses of their ENGs. Both quantitative and qualitative feedback from teams supported 
      programme efficacy for all three students. CONCLUSIONS: The approach appears viable 
      for individuals with AS and has implications for individuals presenting other 
      diagnoses as well. Additional educational/clinical and research implications are 
      discussed.

TI  - Long-term outcome after callosotomy or vagus nerve stimulation in consecutive

      non-specific MRI findings.

AB  - PURPOSE: There is currently no resective (potentially curative) surgical option that 
      is useful in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Palliative procedures such as 
      callosotomy (Cx), vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) or deep brain stimulation have been 
      offered. We compared the outcomes after Cx or VNS in two consecutive prospective 
      cohorts of patients with generalised epilepsy. METHODS: Twenty-four patients 
      underwent callosotomy from 2006 to 2007 (Group 1); 20 additional patients were 
      submitted to VNS from 2008 to 2009 (Group 2). They had generalised epilepsy of the 
      Lennox-Gastaut or Lennox-like type. They were submitted to a neurological interview 
      and examination, interictal and ictal video-EEG, high resolution 1.5T MRI, and 
      cognitive and quality of life evaluations. The two-year post-operative follow-up 
      results were evaluated for each patient. RESULTS: The final mean stimuli intensity 
      was 3.0 mA in the Group 2 patients. Seizure-free patients accounted for 10% in Group 
      1 and none in Group 2. Ten and sixteen percent of the Group 1 and 2 patients, 
      respectively, were non-responders. Improvements in attention and quality of life 
      were noted in 85% of both Group 1 and 2 patients. Rupture of the secondary bilateral 
      synchrony was noted in 85% of Group 1 patients; there was no EEG modification after 
      VNS in Group 2. Both procedures were effective regarding the control of atypical 
      absences and generalised tonic-clonic seizures. Both procedures were not effective 
      in controlling tonic seizures. Callosotomy was very effective in reducing the 
      frequency of atonic seizures, but VNS was ineffective. In contrast, callosotomy was 
      not effective in reducing myoclonic seizures, whereas VNS was. DISCUSSION: 
      Callosotomy might be preferred as the primary treatment in children with 
      Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, and no specific findings on MRI if atonic seizures prevail 
      in the patient's clinical picture; when myoclonic seizures prevail, the same might 
      hold true in favour of VNS. When atypical absence or generalised tonic-clonic 
      seizures are the main concern, although both procedures carry similar effectiveness, 
      VNS might be considered a good option as an initial approach, taking into account 
      the adverse event profile. Patients should be advised that both procedures are not 
      very effective in the treatment of tonic seizures.

TI  - Transcript map of the human chromosome Xq11-Xq21 region: localization of 33 novel 
      genes and one pseudogene.
PG  - 43-50
AB  - The human Xq11-Xq21.3 region has been implicated in several inherited disorders 
      including dystonia-parkinsonism (DYT3), sideroblastic anemia and several specific 
      and non-specific forms of mental retardation (MR) syndromes. As part of a positional 
      cloning effort to identify MR genes, we have generated a YAC-based transcript map. 
      We first constructed a YAC/STS framework by extending previously published contigs. 
      This framework map consists of a minimal set of 119 clones, covering approximately 
      20 Megabases (Mb) and allowing the precise ordering of 71 STSs between DXS136 and 
      DXS472. This YAC contig was then used to define the positions of genes and expressed 
      sequence tags (ESTs) assigned to the Xcen-Xq21.3 region. In addition to the genes 
      previously localized to this part of the X chromosome, 18 transcription units 
      corresponding to additional known genes or gene family members, one pseudogene and 
      15 novel transcripts were mapped. This transcriptional map incorporates 51 
      transcription units and provides a useful resource of candidate genes for some of 
      the disorders assigned to this region of the X chromosome.

      calcification of the lateral ventricular choroid plexus, and increased CSF protein. 
      Neurophysiologic studies yielded nonspecific results, and endocrine studies, 
      including parathormone levels, were normal. Simultaneous measurements of CSF and 
      serum calcium, magnesium, and other electrolytes were normal, but the CSF/serum 
      ratio of phosphate was low, suggesting a possible role in the pathogenesis of this 
      syndrome.

TI  - Insertional translocation leading to a 4q13 duplication including the EPHA5 gene in 
      two siblings with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.
PG  - 1923-8
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.a.36032 [doi]
AB  - An insertional translocation (IT) can result in pure segmental aneusomy for the 
      inserted genomic segment allowing to define a more accurate clinical phenotype. 
      Here, we report on two siblings sharing an unbalanced IT inherited from the mother 
      with a history of learning difficulty. An 8-year-old girl with developmental delay, 
      speech disability, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), showed by 
      GTG banding analysis a subtle interstitial alteration in 21q21. Oligonucleotide 
      array comparative genomic hybridization (array-CGH) analysis showed a 4q13.1-q13.3 
      duplication spanning 8.6 Mb. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with 
      bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones confirmed the rearrangement, a 
      der(21)ins(21;4)(q21;q13.1q13.3). The duplication described involves 50 RefSeq genes 
      including the EPHA5 gene that encodes for the EphA5 receptor involved in embryonic 
      development of the brain and also in synaptic remodeling and plasticity thought to 
      underlie learning and memory. The same rearrangement was observed in a younger 
      brother with behavioral problems and also exhibiting ADHD. ADHD is among the most 
      heritable of neuropsychiatric disorders. There are few reports of patients with 
      duplications involving the proximal region of 4q and a mild phenotype. To the best 
      of our knowledge this is the first report of a duplication restricted to band 4q13. 
      This abnormality could be easily missed in children who have nonspecific cognitive 
      impairment. The presence of this behavioral disorder in the two siblings reinforces 
      the hypothesis that the region involved could include genes involved in ADHD.

TI  - Problems in the diagnosis of fragile X syndrome in young children are still present.
PG  - 110-5
AB  - Fragile X syndrome is common; its prevalence approaches 1 per 5,000. Fragile X 
      syndrome is the most common inherited cause of mental retardation. Many 
      professionals must deal with fragile X individuals on a daily basis. However, 
      despite the diverse information on the epidemiology, clinical features, unique 
      pattern of inheritance, cytogenetic, and molecular diagnosis and scales for the 
      diagnosis of this syndrome, the diagnosis of fragile X syndrome is still not always 
      made by the patients' specialists. Here we present the difficulties in the diagnosis 
      of fragile X syndrome in 11 children under 8 years of age, 10 boys and one girl. We 
      report data on initial symptoms, behavioral features, and physical and mental 
      development before molecular studies were considered. The possible causes for the 
      diagnosis delay were multiple: nonspecific features (e.g., macrocephaly, overgrowth, 
      obesity), unremarkable physical examination, family history apparently 
      noncontributory, and lack of or delayed molecular testing. Careful clinical 
      examination of young children and DNA screening in case of doubt, and education of 
      professionals in medical specialty areas, behavioral sciences, education, and other 
      fields are recommended.

TI  - Cognitive processing of children with Williams syndrome.
PG  - 650-6
AB  - The Illinois Test of Psycholinguistic Abilities was administered to 22 children with 
      Williams syndrome and to 22 children with non-specific development disabilities, 
      matched for age, sex and global intelligence. Visual processing abilities 
      significantly differentiated the two groups. The children with Williams syndrome had 
      substantially more problems with visual reception, visual closure and visual memory 
      tasks. They appeared to adhere more rigidly than controls to a global deployment of 
      visual attention. Their visual processing difficulties were not related to the level 
      of mental ability. Visual reception, closure and memory scores correctly classified 
      82 per cent of the children with Williams syndrome and 68 per cent of the controls. 
      Instructional and remedial programs are needed for these children.

TI  - Partial trisomy of chromosome 14: (+14q-).
PG  - 119-24
AB  - Partial trisomy 14 as a 47, + 14q- karyotype is compatible with life and this state 
      is distinguished on cytogenetic, not clinical, grounds. Clinical features are 
      nonspecific and these children are most obvious because of growth and mental 
      retardation. This extends and broadens the indications for chromosome analysis. The 
      significance of finding a +14q- karyotype must, however, be considered in the 
      knowledge that ESA fragments have been associated with disorders that do not have a 
      chromosome aberration pathogenesis. A balanced translocation should always be sought 
      in parents of affected children. Finally, the proximal long arm of chromosome 14 
      apparently has at least 2 sites of relative fragility: 14q12 in vitro and 14q22 in 
      vivo. Blood group analyses have been uninformative (2, 5).

PG  - 2508-15
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.a.37248 [doi]
AB  - We report on a sister and two brothers born to healthy Iranian parents with mild 
      intellectual disability, progressive muscle weakness, and characteristic facies. 
      including highly arched eyebrows, down-slanting palpebral fissures, prominent nasal 
      bridge, prominent nose, columella extending below alae nasi, narrow mouth, narrow 
      palate, and dental caries, and in one of them an inability to abduct the left eye. 
      Electrophysiological studies showed signs of myopathy, and muscle biopsies 
      demonstrated only nonspecific signs. Brain MRIs in two of the sibs showed 
      leukencephalopathy with delayed myelination, frontal and parietal hyperintensities, 
      and hippocampal atrophy in one. We have been unable to find a description of this 
      association of features in literature. Based on the occurrence in siblings, no 
      significant difference in phenotype between the brothers and sister, absence of 
      manifestations in parents, and a likely consanguinity between parents we performed a 
      homozygosity mapping. A single identical-by-descent bloc encompassing 57 genes 
      located at 3p24.3-p25.3 was found to segregate within the family with this 
      phenotype. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

LID - 10.1002/ajmg.a.35860 [doi]
AB  - Intellectual disability affects approximately 2% of the population, with affected 
      males outnumbering affected female, partly due to disturbances involving X-linked 
      genes. To date >90 genes associated with X-linked intellectual disability have been 
      identified and, among these, IL1RAPL1 (interleukin 1 receptor accessory protein-like 
      1), was first described and mapped to Xp21.3-22.1 in 1999. Intragenic deletions of 
      IL1RAPL1, only rarely identified, have mostly been associated with nonspecific 
      intellectual disability (IDX) and autism spectrum disorder. Array-CGH analysis 
      performed in our patient with intellectual disability, mild dysmorphic signs and 
      changes in behavior identified a 285 Kb deletion in chromosome Xp21.3-21.2, with 
      breakpoints lying in IL1RAPL1 gene intron 2 and intron 3. This is the first patient 
      reported in literature with deletion of only exon 3 of IL1RAPL1 gene. Our patient 
      also exhibits bilateral progressive neurosensorial deafness, which has not been 
      previously associated with IL1RAPL1 mutations.

TI  - [Monozygous female twins discordant for a pattern of X chromosome inactivation as a 
      model for study on X-linked intellectual traits].
PG  - 66-70
AB  - Ring the last decades, numerous genes for general cognitive ability were identified 
      on human X-chromosome. They were discovered primarily because of X-linked mutations 
      causing nonspecific mental retardation in males. Evidence for imprinted loci on the 
      X chromosome affecting neurodevelopment was found in studies on 45,X females. 
      Investigation of transmission of X-linked traits in normal individuals might further 
      contribute to problem of shaping human being's mind ability. We suggest monozygous 
      female twins discordant for a parent-of-origin of the X chromosome inactivation to 
      be a proper subject for such explorations.

TI  - Rett syndrome: a retrospective pilot study on potential early predictive 
      symptomatology.
PG  - 481-6
AB  - A pilot study is presented, in which traditional neurodevelopmental parameters were 
      retrospectively used in an attempt to compare the early development of 10 young 
      girls with Rett syndrome (RS) to that of considered normality in child health 
      screening. The early developmental profile at key ages was defined by applying the 
      Denver Developmental Screening Test frames for the range of normal development, to 
      the achievements recorded for each child during routine developmental assessment in 
      Swedish child health care. Key ages chosen were 6, 9-10, 15, 18 and 24 months. At 
      the 6 month level no predictive deviations could have been revealed. At 9-10 months 
      suspicions of abnormal development could have been arisen from a delayed, 
      dissociated motor development combined with immaturity of equilibrium functions. 
      Developmental deviations and neurological signs indicative of RS had been present in 
      5 of the girls at 15 months, in 8 at 18 months and in all 10 at 24 months. Possible 
      predictive signs were loss of acquired hand skill and learned single words, 
      diminished communication and contact ability, appearance of truncal instability and 
      dysequilibrium signs. The insidious appearance of motor developmental deviations 
      during infancy, dwelling inside the concept of normality, was confirmed. Loss of 
      acquired manipulative hand skill, often mixed with non-specific circulating 
      hand-mouth movements, still constitutes the single most informative early warning 
      signal for the syndrome.

TI  - Prenatal fragile X detection using cytoplasmic and nuclear-specific monoclonal 
      antibodies.
PG  - 342-6
AB  - We have been carrying out studies aimed at improving prenatal detection of the 
      fragile X chromosome/mutation. Our current protocol requires a turnaround time (TAT) 
      of several days. In an attempt to reduce the TAT, we have turned to the use of 
      monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Monoclonal antibody 1A1 (provided by Dr. Mandel of 
      INSERM) immunostaining was performed according to a modified three-step 
      immunocytochemical procedure. We found that cytoplasmic staining intensities, using 
      mAb 1A1/avidin biotinylated complex/diaminobenzidine, varied from light to heavy 
      within each sample, with controls exhibiting a majority of heavily stained cells in 
      both chorionic villus (CV) sample and amniotic fluid cultured cells. Using mAb 1A1 
      and a new nuclear-specific antibody, mAb 3F11, we found that CV cultured cells 
      harboring the FMR1 full mutation could be distinguished from controls as early as 10 
      weeks of gestation in both male and female specimens. Western blot analysis showed 
      that the antibodies have similar staining patterns but that mAb 3F11 has fewer 
      background/nonspecific bands. Our results demonstrate that it is feasible to detect 
      fragile X full mutations within one day after obtaining cells from CV specimens 
      taken as early as 10 weeks of gestation.

TI  - The prevalence of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease based on non-specific symptoms 
      in institutionalized, intellectually disabled individuals.
PG  - 187-90
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The prevalence of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) in randomly 
      selected, institutionalized, intellectually disabled individuals (IQ < 50) in The 
      Netherlands is high. DESIGN: In this study we investigated the prevalence of GORD 
      and reflux oesophagitis (RO) in intellectually disabled individuals specifically 
      selected for symptoms such as: behavioural difficulties such as automutilation, food 
      refusal, fear and restlessness, vomiting, regurgitation and rumination. Predisposing 
      factors were also evaluated. METHODS: One hundred and ten individuals from one 
      institute underwent a 24-h oesophageal pH test and were scored for predisposing 
      factors and non-specific reflux symptoms. A pathological pH test was defined as a pH 
      lower than 4 more than 4.5% of the measured time. Subjects with a pathological pH 
      test (patients) were compared to those with a normal pH test (controls). RESULTS: In 
      seven cases (6.4%) the test failed for technical reasons. In 57 (55.3%) cases a 
      pathological pH test was found. RO was diagnosed in 33 (64.7%) patients. The use of 
      anticonvulsant drugs and cerebral palsy appeared to be predisposing factors, while 
      the non-specific reflux symptoms did not discriminate for GORD. CONCLUSION: The 
      prevalence of GORD was equal in a randomly selected group of intellectually disabled 
      individuals, and in this group, specifically selected on account of possible reflux 
      symptoms. This study confirms that in this particular group, it is nearly impossible 
      to discriminate for the diagnosis of GORD on non-specific reflux symptoms only. 
      However, GORD may be suspected where there are certain predisposing factors, 
      particularly cerebral palsy and use of anticonvulsant drugs.)

TI  - The use of testicular volume as a clinical marker for cytogenetic disorders in 
      mentally retarded males.
PG  - 19-30
AB  - The testicular volumes (V) of 817 adult (non-Down's syndrome) institutionalized 
      males were calculated. The mean testicular volume was 19.5 +/- 15.8 ml, comparable 
      to the normal adult male mean of 17-19 ml. However, the number of institutionalized 
      males with V greater than or equal to 25 ml and V less than or equal to 10 ml was 
      increased approximately fourfold over the normal male population. Resident adult 
      males were grouped into three categories based on their testicular volumes: (1) V 
      greater than or equal to 25 ml (macro-orchid); (2) V less than or equal to 15 ml 
      (micro-orchid); and (3) 15 less than V less than 25 ml ('normal'). An equal number 
      of randomly selected males from each category were cytogenetically screened for the 
      fra(X) syndrome as well as for non-fra(X) chromosome abnormalities. The overall 
      frequencies of these disorders were 3.1% and 3.9%, respectively. The fra(X) syndrome 
      was found in a significantly higher percentage of macro-orchid males (10.3%) as 
      compared to males with either micro-orchidism (1.2%) or normal testicular volume 
      (1.2%). There was no significant difference in the distribution of either fra(X) 
      negative non-specific XLMR or non-fra(X) chromosome abnormalities among resident 
      males from these three categories. Testicular volumes greater than or equal to 25 
      ml, especially those exceeding 40 ml, were thus shown to be useful clinical markers 
      in the diagnosis of the fra(X) syndrome. Reduced testicular volume was not a useful 
      clinical marker in the evaluation of other non-Down's syndrome chromosome 
      abnormalities.

AB  - We report on a 6-year-old child with a de novo 1.6 Mb deletion in the 3q26.31q26.32 
      region identified by SNP array, involving only one relevant gene: TBL1XR1. The girl 
      shows non-specific, mild to moderate intellectual deficiency but no autistic 
      behavior. Point mutations in TBL1XR1 have recently been implicated in three patients 
      with intellectual disability (ID) and autistic features. Our report supports that 
      haploinsufficiency for TBL1XR1 could be implicated in non-ASD autosomal dominant ID.

      siblings. Autistic subjects of both sexes had higher non-optimality scores than 
      their siblings. Much of this difference was accounted for by a higher incidence of 
      firstborns and fourth- or later-borns in the autistic group. Of factors found in 
      previous research with mentally handicapped, autistic samples, only estimated weeks 
      of gestation greater than 42 occurred more often in autistic subjects than siblings. 
      The only sex difference specific to the autistic group was that autistic males came 
      from larger families than females. These data provide slight support for the 
      contribution of nonspecific pre- and perinatal factors to other etiological bases of 
      autism. It is proposed that pre- and perinatal factors may play less of a role in 
      autism in high-functioning individuals than suggested in studies of autism 
      associated with severe retardation.

TI  - Molecular characterisation of four cases of intrachromosomal triplication of 
      chromosome 15q11-q14.
PG  - 26-34
AB  - CONTEXT: Chromosomal abnormalities that involve the proximal region of chromosome 
      15q occur relatively frequently in the human population. However, interstitial 
      triplications involving one 15 homologue are very rare with three cases reported to 
      date. OBJECTIVE: To provide a detailed molecular characterisation of four additional 
      patients with interstitial triplications of chromosome 15q11-q14. DESIGN: Molecular 
      analyses were performed using DNA markers and probes specific for the 15q11-q14 
      region. SETTING: Molecular cytogenetics laboratory at the University of Chicago. 
      SUBJECTS: Four patients with mild to severe mental retardation and features of 
      Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) or Angelman syndrome (AS) were referred for molecular 
      cytogenetic analysis following identification of a suspected 
      duplication/triplication of chromosome 15q11-q14 by routine cytogenetic analysis. 
      MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) was performed to 
      determine the type of chromosomal abnormality present, the extent of the abnormal 
      region, and the orientation of the extra chromosomal segments. Molecular 
      polymorphism analysis was performed to determine the parental origin of the 
      abnormality. Methylation and northern blot analyses of the SNRPN gene were performed 
      to determine the effect of extra copies of the SNRPN gene on its methylation pattern 
      and expression. RESULTS: Fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) using probes 
      within and flanking the Prader-Willi/Angelman syndrome critical region indicated 
      that all patients carried an intrachromosomal triplication of proximal 15q11-q14 in 
      one of the two chromosome 15 homologues (trip(15)). In all patients the orientation 
      of the triplicated segments was normal-inverted-normal, suggesting that a common 
      mechanism of rearrangement may have been involved. Microsatellite analysis showed 
      the parental origin of the trip(15) to be maternal in three cases and paternal in 
      one case. The paternal triplication patient had features similar to PWS, one 
      maternal triplication patient had features similar to AS, and the other two maternal 
      triplication patients had non-specific findings including hypotonia and mental 
      retardation. Methylation analysis at exon 1 of the SNRPN locus showed increased 
      dosage of either the paternal or maternal bands in the paternal or maternal 
      triplication patients, respectively, suggesting that the methylation pattern shows a 
      dose dependent increase that correlates with the parental origin of the 
      triplication. In addition, the expression of SNRPN was analysed by northern blotting 
      and expression levels were consistent with dosage and parental origin of the 
      triplication. CONCLUSIONS: These four additional cases of trip(15) will provide 
      additional information towards understanding the phenotypic effects of this 
      abnormality and aid in understanding the mechanism of formation of other chromosome 
      15 rearrangements.

TI  - Spectrum of X-linked hydrocephalus (HSAS), MASA syndrome, and complicated spastic 
      paraplegia (SPG1): Clinical review with six additional families.
PG  - 107-16
AB  - X-linked hydrocephalus (HSAS) (MIM *307000), MASA syndrome (MIM *303350), and 
      complicated spastic paraplegia (SPG1) (MIM *312900) are closely related. Soon after 
      delineation, SPG1 was incorporated into the spectrum of MASA syndrome. HSAS and MASA 
      syndrome show great clinical overlap; DNA linkage analysis places the loci at Xq28. 
      In an increasing number of families with MASA syndrome or HSAS, mutations in L1CAM, 
      a gene located at Xq28, have been reported. In order to further delineate the 
      clinical spectrum, we studied 6 families with male patients presenting with MASA 
      syndrome, HSAS, or a mixed phenotype. We summarized data from previous reports and 
      compared them with our data. Clinical variability appears to be great, even within 
      families. Problems in genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis, the possible 
      overlap with X-linked corpus callosum agenesis and FG syndrome, and the different 
      forms of X-linked complicated spastic paraplegia are discussed. Since adducted 
      thumbs and spastic paraplegia are found in 90% of the patients, the condition may be 
      present in males with nonspecific mental retardation. We propose to abandon the 
      designation MASA syndrome and use the term HSAS/MASA spectrum, incorporating SPG1.

TI  - [Ring chromosome 8: microcephaly, mental retardation and minor facial anomalies with 
      adhesive behavioral phenotype].
PG  - 746-50
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Since the first description of ring chromosome 8 [r(8)] in 1973, only 
      a few patients have been reported. In this report we present a child with this 
      anomaly, and we compare his clinical manifestations with previously reported 
      patients. CLINICAL CASE: A 12 year-old boy presented with low birth weight, mental 
      retardation, microcephaly, short stature, hypotonia, and minor facial anomalies: 
      hypotelorism, bilateral epicanthic folds, long philtrum, thin lips, narrow palate, 
      micrognathia and low-set ears. Digital anomalies were bilateral brachyclinodactily 
      of the fifth finger, and cutaneous syndactyly between second and third fingers. The 
      boy had a pleasant personality but exhibit attachment for people and things with 
      unrestricted affect. Cytogenetic analysis on peripheral white blood cells showed a 
      r(8) chromosome. Parental karyotypes were both normal. CONCLUSIONS: The major 
      features in the boy studied by us were found also in the other cases reported with 
      an r(8) chromosome, but all they were non-specific features, and do not support the 
      existence of a readily recognizable r(8) chromosome syndrome . Follow-up data with 
      special emphasis on the behavioral characteristics are needed for defining an 
      specific behavioral phenotype.

TI  - Impairment of different protein domains causes variable clinical presentation within 
      Pitt-Hopkins syndrome and suggests intragenic molecular syndromology of TCF4.

AB  - Pitt-Hopkins syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by severe 
      intellectual disability and a distinctive facial gestalt. It is caused by 
      haploinsufficiency of the TCF4 gene. The TCF4 protein has different functional 
      domains, with the NLS (nuclear localization signal) domain coded by exons 7-8 and 
      the bHLH (basic Helix-Loop-Helix) domain coded by exon 18. Several alternatively 
      spliced TCF4 variants have been described, allowing for translation of variable 
      protein isoforms. Typical PTHS patients have impairment of at least the bHLH domain. 
      To which extent impairment of the remaining domains contributes to the final 
      phenotype is not clear. There is recent evidence that certain loss-of-function 
      variants disrupting TCF4 are associated with mild ID, but not with typical PTHS. We 
      describe a frameshift-causing partial gene deletion encompassing exons 4-6 of TCF4 
      in an adult patient with mild ID and nonspecific facial dysmorphisms but without the 
      typical features of PTHS, and a c.520C > T nonsense variant within exon 8 in a child 
      presenting with a severe phenotype largely mimicking PTHS, but lacking the typical 
      facial dysmorphism. Investigation on mRNA, along with literature review, led us to 
      suggest a preliminary phenotypic map of loss-of-function variants affecting TCF4. An 
      intragenic phenotypic map of loss-of-function variants in TCF4 is suggested here for 
      the first time: variants within exons 1-4 and exons 4-6 give rise to a recurrent 
      phenotype with mild ID not in the spectrum of Pitt-Hopkins syndrome (biallelic 
      preservation of both the NLS and bHLH domains); variants within exons 7-8 cause a 
      severe phenotype resembling PTHS but in absence of the typical facial dysmorphism 
      (impairment limited to the NLS domain); variants within exons 9-19 cause typical 
      Pitt-Hopkins syndrome (impairment of at least the bHLH domain). Understanding the 
      TCF4 molecular syndromology can allow for proper nosology in the current era of 
      whole genomic investigations.

TI  - Neurofibromatosis in childhood: a review of 25 cases.
PG  - 49-52
AB  - The initial symptoms and signs of neurofibromatosis in 25 children are reported, and 
      the literature is briefly reviewed. Two little known associations of 
      neurofibromatosis are revealed. Four children showed hydrocephalus related to 
      stricture of the aqueduct of Sylvius. Four other children presented with failure to 
      thrive in infancy which was regarded in retrospect as a non-specific association of 
      neurofibromatosis. It is emphasized that such manifestations may be the presenting 
      features of neurofibromatosis in children.

AB  - Reenactment of the circumstances in deaths associated with restraint, utilizing 
      participants and witnesses while memories are fresh, may help death investigators 
      more accurately determine the cause of death. Two recent deaths in Ventura County 
      that occurred during restraint are discussed. Within a day of the autopsies the 
      restrainers agreed to participate in reenactments of the restraint process, 
      utilizing live volunteers as subjects. They allowed videotaping. Deaths associated 
      with restraint often have nonspecific autopsy findings. Timely reenactment of the 
      circumstances of deaths associated with restraint can help death investigators more 
      accurately determine the probable cause of death in these difficult cases.

TI  - Trinucleotide repeat expansion in the FRAXE locus is not common among 
      institutionalized individuals with non-specific developmental disabilities.
PG  - 420-3
AB  - Expansion of a polymorphic GCC-repeat at the FRAXE locus has been associated with 
      expression of chromosome fragility at this site and cognitive impairment in some 
      individuals previously testing negative for CGG-repeat expansion in the fragile X 
      mental retardation-1 (FMR1) gene. To determine the frequency of FRAXE triplet repeat 
      expansion among persons with developmental disability, 396 individuals from two 
      institutions were studied, all of whom were negative for FMR1 repeat expansion. 
      Clinically, there was a wide range of mental impairment, with the majority (61.1%) 
      being severely to profoundly affected. The distribution of FRAXE GCC-repeat numbers 
      in the study population was 5-38: 28 (5.6%) with 10-14 repeats; 366 (73.8%) with 
      15-19 repeats; 74 (14.9%) with 20-24 repeats; 20 (4.0%) with 25-29 repeats; and 5 
      (1.0%) with 30-38 repeats, with no individuals demonstrating repeat expansion. One 
      profoundly retarded male was found to have a deletion of about 40 bp. Southern blots 
      of HindIII-digested DNAs from individuals with > or = 26 repeats all showed normal 
      patterns. These results suggest that FRAXE GCC-repeat expansion is not a common 
      cause of developmental disability in institutionalized persons with mild to profound 
      mental retardation.

TI  - Fibroblast growth factor homologous factor 2 (FHF2): gene structure, expression and 
      mapping to the Börjeson-Forssman-Lehmann syndrome region in Xq26 delineated by a 
      duplication breakpoint in a BFLS-like patient.
PG  - 56-63
AB  - Börjeson-Forssman-Lehmann syndrome (BFLS) is a syndromal X-linked mental 
      retardation, which maps by linkage to the q26 region of the human X chromosome. We 
      have identified a male patient with BFLS-like features and a duplication, 
      46,Y,dup(X)(q26q28), inherited from his phenotypically normal mother. Fluorescence 
      in situ hybridisation using yeast artificial chromosome clones from Xq26 localised 
      the duplication breakpoint to an approximately 400-kb interval in the Xq26.3 region 
      between DXS155 and DXS294/DXS730. Database searches and analysis of available 
      genomic DNA sequence from the region revealed the presence of the fibroblast growth 
      factor homologous factor gene, FHF2, within the duplication breakpoint interval. The 
      gene structure of FHF2 was determined and two new exons were identified, including a 
      new 5' end exon, 1B. FHF2 is a large gene extending over approximately 200 kb in 
      Xq26.3 and is composed of at least seven exons. It shows tissue-specific alternative 
      splicing and alternative transcription starts. Northern blot hybridisation showed 
      highest expression in brain and skeletal muscle. The FHF2 gene localisation and 
      tissue-specific expression pattern suggest it to be a candidate gene for familial 
      cases of the BFLS syndrome and other syndromal and non-specific forms of X-linked 
      mental retardation mapping to the region.

TI  - Behavioural treatment for sleep problems in children with severe learning 
      disabilities and challenging daytime behaviour: effect on daytime behaviour.
PG  - 627-35
AB  - The study aimed to investigate a group of children with severe learning 
      disabilities, challenging daytime behaviour, and severe sleep problems to see if 
      successful behavioural treatment of the children's sleep problems resulted in 
      reduced daytime challenging behaviour as reported by mothers and teachers. A 
      randomised controlled trial of behavioural interventions for the children's sleep 
      problems was conducted (N = 30). The intervention group received an individually 
      tailored behavioural programme and were supported by telephone calls from the 
      therapist. Baseline assessments of the children's behaviour were made using the 
      Aberrant Behavior Checklist and were repeated 1 month and 3 months after the start 
      of intervention. There were no behavioural changes that were specific to children in 
      the treatment group. However, improvements in some behaviours were seen in both the 
      intervention and the control group at the 1-month and 3-month assessments and there 
      was agreement between mothers' and teachers' reports for many of these changes. The 
      results suggest that nonspecific effects of participating in the study (including an 
      increased sleep duration, which was seen in both groups), rather than resolution of 
      sleep problem per se, may have a beneficial effect on child behaviour and these 
      factors need to be identified for therapeutic use.

TI  - Case report: an unexpected link between partial deletion of the SHANK3 gene and

AB  - BACKGROUND: Deletions and mutations involving the SHANK3 gene lead to a nonspecific 
      clinical presentation with moderate to profound intellectual disability, severely 
      delayed or absent speech, and autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Better knowledge of 
      the clinical spectrum of SHANK3 haploinsufficiency is useful to facilitate clinical 
      care monitoring and to guide molecular diagnosis, essential for genetic counselling. 
      CASE PRESENTATION: Here, we report a detailed clinical description of a 10-year-old 
      girl carrying a pathogenic interstitial 22q13.3 deletion encompassing only the first 
      17 exons of SHANK3. The clinical features displayed by the girl strongly suggested 
      the diagnosis of dementia infantilis, described by Heller in 1908, also known as 
      childhood disintegrative disorder. CONCLUSION: Our present case confirms several 
      observations according to which regression may be part of the clinical phenotype of 
      SHANK3 haploinsufficiency. Therefore, we think it is crucial to look for mutations 
      in the gene SHANK3 in patients diagnosed for childhood disintegrative disorder or 
      any developmental disorder with a regressive pattern involving social and 
      communicative skills as well as cognitive and instinctual functions, with onset 
      around 3 years.

AB  - Intellectual disability (ID) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous 
      condition; the cause is unknown in most non-specific and sporadic cases. To 
      establish an etiological basis in those patients represents a difficult challenge. 
      Over the last years it has become apparent that chromosomal rearrangements below the 
      detection level of conventional karyotyping contribute significantly to the cause of 
      ID. We present three patients with non-specific intellectual disability who all have 
      overlapping microdeletions in the chromosomal region 12p12.1. De novo occurrence of 
      the deletion could be proven in the two cases from which parental samples were 
      available. All three identified deletions have different breakpoints and range in 
      size from 120 kb to 4.9 Mb. The smallest deletion helps to narrow down the critical 
      region to a genomic segment (chr12:23,924,800-24,041,698, build 37/hg19) 
      encompassing only one gene, SOX5. SOX5 is a member of the SOX (SRY-related HMG-box) 
      family of transcription factors shown to play roles in chondroblast function, 
      oligodendrocyte differentiation and migration, as well as ensuring proper 
      development of specific neuronal cell types. Because of these biological functions, 
      mutations in SOX5 are predicted to cause complex disease syndromes, as it is the 
      case for other SOX genes, but such mutations have not yet been identified. Our 
      findings indicate that haploinsufficiency of SOX5 is a cause of intellectual 
      disability without any striking physical anomalies.

AB  - Behavioral treatment approaches to obesity in 17 mild-to-moderate retarded female 
      adults were assigned to one of two experimental conditions, (a) behavioral 
      self-control along with a physical activity component and (b) behavioral 
      self-control. No significant differences were noted between groups on the indices of 
      body weight and tricep skinfold thickness. A one-way analysis of variance with a 
      repeated measure yielded a significant main effect of time for change in weight for 
      both groups at the end of the 8-week treatment. Questions were raised about the 
      possible role of nonspecific motivational factors versus cognitive factors in 
      behavioral-weight reduction programs.

TI  - Merosin positive congenital muscular dystrophy with mental deficiency, epilepsy and 
      MRI changes in the cerebral white matter.
PG  - 187-90
AB  - A girl born from consanguineous Turkish parents had marked hypotonia from birth and 
      delayed milestones. She was able to stand unaided by 3 years of age with then 
      progressive worsening of motor abilities. She had a severe non-progressive mental 
      deficiency. Epilepsy occurred by 6 years of age. Ophthalmological investigation was 
      normal. A marked white matter high signal was seen on magnetic resonance imaging 
      without cortical dysplasia. Dystrophic changes were seen on muscle biopsy. Two 
      brothers had had a similar history with early death. Muscular immunocytochemical 
      studies showed a normal staining for dystrophin and all dystrophin related 
      glycoproteins (including 43 and 50 DAG). Merosin staining was normal. This case 
      differs from Fukuyama's congenital dystrophy, from merosin negative congenital 
      muscular dystrophy, or from other congenital muscular dystrophy with CNS 
      dysfunction. It underlines the heterogeneity of congenital muscular dystrophy and 
      the non-specific aspect of white matter changes on neuro-imaging.

TI  - [Clinical and cytogenetic diagnosis of Martin-Bell syndrome].
PG  - 49-53
AB  - A total of 368 patients aged 1 year 11 months to 35 years with oligophrenia were 
      examined cytogenetically. Out of 58 boys with a typical disease picture, the fragile 
      X chromosome (fra-X) was revealed in 57. In all the cases, the syndrome could be 
      diagnosed clinically before chromosomal analysis was made. In a group of children 
      with undifferentiated oligophrenia including those with the sex-linked inheritance 
      type, fra-X was not discovered. Besides, the fragile X chromosome was revealed in 4 
      girls. Of these, 3 were probands' sisters and one case was sporadic. The girls 
      manifested both symptomatology typical for Martin-Bell syndrome and nonspecific 
      mental retardation. Another 55 probands' relatives were examined clinically and 
      cytogenetically. The fra-X was discovered in 9 mothers of the patients. The mean IQ 
      in the women with the revealed fragile X chromosome was much lower than the mean IQ 
      of all the women, mothers of the sick children. It is concluded that in spite of a 
      wide range of the variability of somatic and psychopathological disorders in 
      patients with Martin-Bell syndrome, the possibility of the clinical diagnosis of the 
      disease without making cytogenetic studies attains as much as almost 100%. Symptoms, 
      specific for the clinical diagnosis of the disease were distinguished.

TI  - [Suspected free air--a case report of a patient with a huge fecaloma].
PG  - 815-7, 856, 855
AB  - Abdominal free air upon X-ray examination implies a medical emergency, but there is 
      an extensive differential diagnosis that should be considered. Fecaloma is one of 
      the possible imitators of free abdominal air. Fecaloma is a complication of chronic 
      constipation, in which a large fecal mass impacts the bowel, imitating a tumor mass. 
      This phenomenon is not uncommon in the elderly, and requires prompt recognition and 
      immediate medical treatment. A 29-year-old woman, known to suffer from mental 
      retardation, was admitted due to frequent vomiting and diarrhea following 
      constipation a few days prior to her admission. The patient was treated in her 
      institution by an enema, with partial decompression, that was followed by recurrent 
      vomiting and fever. Physical examination upon admittance revealed a distended 
      abdomen without peritoneal signs. An abdominal X-ray series demonstrated a distended 
      large bowel with an abundance of fecal contents, and suspected free air in the 
      abdominal cavity. Due to these findings, an abdominal CT was performed, which 
      demonstrated a huge fecaloma involving the descending and sigmoid colon. The patient 
      was treated non-operatively with: IV fluids, oral laxatives, frequent enemas and 
      manual stool disimpaction. Following this treatment the patient's condition improved 
      dramatically. Fecaloma is a situation that requires prompt recognition and 
      treatment. The diagnosis of fecaloma is a clinical challenge. In addition to signs, 
      symptoms and physical examination, which may be non-specific, the use of X-rays, CT 
      and US may aid in the diagnosis. The treatment in most cases consists primarily of 
      hydration, laxatives, enemas and manual disimpaction. If there is no improvement, 
      one should consider endoscopic treatment, or surgery which may entail a partial or 
      total colectomy.

TI  - Mitochondrial DNA 8993 (NARP) mutation presenting with a heterogeneous phenotype 
      including 'cerebral palsy'.
PG  - 419-22
AB  - The mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutation 8993 is an important cause of Leigh's 
      encephalopathy. A family is reported where other affected members have presented 
      with non-specific delayed development or cerebral palsy. The diagnosis should be 
      considered not only in children with Leigh's encephalopathy, but also in those with 
      mild neurological dysfunction (including cerebral palsy) if there is a pigmentary 
      retinopathy or a family history of neurological or ophthalmological disease. There 
      was some correlation in this family between the disease severity and the proportion 
      of mutant mtDNA in the blood. This mutation appears to segregate to high levels of 
      mutant mtDNA rapidly within pedigrees and the mother of a severely affected child 
      has a high risk of having further children with a high proportion of mutant mtDNA 
      and a severe phenotype.

PG  - 10-22
AB  - Early evoked responses to 500-Hz tone bursts were recorded from normal and 
      hearing-impaired children and adults. The threshold values of the early evoked 
      responses provide useful estimates of auditory functioning, even among 
      difficult-to-test populations, such as deaf-blind children. Latency measures 
      indicate that the early response is generated at the brain stem. Latency measures 
      from hearing-impaired subjects show that the response can identify recruitment. 
      Several subjects having a history of nonspecific communication disorders, e.g., 
      dyslexia, exhibited aberrant early evoked response waveforms. The early-evoked 
      response measures, therefore, amy be useful in detecting and assessing communication 
      disorders which are believed to be of cortical origin, but now should be considered 
      to have a basis in brain stem dysfunction.

AB  - Standardized cognitive, behavioral, and neuroanatomical data are presented on 2

      normal IQ, both boys had a history of developmental delay, including significant 
      problems with communication, attention, and overactivity. Additionally, one child 
      was diagnosed with autistic disorder. Data from these 2 cases are compared to 
      analogous information from previous reports about individuals with the FRAXE or 
      FRAXA (FMR1) mutation. These comparisons support the idea that FRAXE is associated 
      with nonspecific developmental delay and possibly high-functioning autism.

PG  - 5-9
AB  - An analysis of the frequency and type of chromosome aberrations found in 1611 
      cytogenetic studies has been done in relation to the clinical indications. The most 
      frequent reason for referral was: MCM/MR syndrome (15.4% cases), suspicion of sex 
      chromosome abnormality (13.1%), Down syndrome (11.2%) and reproductive wastage 
      (10.6%). The incidence of abnormal karyotypes in these groups of patients was 10.1%, 
      24.2%, 87.9% and 9.3% per couple, respectively. The lowest percentage of chromosome 
      aberrations was found among patients with nonspecific mental retardation (2.2%) and 
      in the families who lost a baby with MCM Syndrome (3.3% per couple). On the whole, 
      abnormal karyotype was found in 364 patients (22.6%). Among 62 families identified 
      by the affected child with, structural chromosome aberration in 24 families (38.7%) 
      the abnormality was familial in the origin.

TI  - Chiari I malformation in asymptomatic young children with Williams syndrome: 
      clinical and MRI study.
PG  - 177-81
AB  - We report clinical and magnetic resonance imaging findings in two young children, 
      aged 2 years 4 months and 3 years, with Williams syndrome. Both showed a mild global 
      delay, although their neurological examination was completely normal. Their magnetic 
      resonance imaging, however, showed Chiari I malformation and some non-specific 
      changes in the centrum semiovale and in the white matter posterior to the lateral 
      ventricles. Cerebellar tonsils were displaced through the foramen magnum 8.5 and 7.5 
      mm respectively. Our results suggest that Chiari I malformation can also be a 
      frequent feature in subjects with Williams syndrome even in the absence of overt 
      neurological signs suggestive of it. Whether these children might develop acute 
      signs later is not known at present. Further studies are needed not only to evaluate 
      the incidence of these findings in the global population of subjects with Williams 
      syndrome but also to identify the children who are at risk for developing acute 
      neurological signs.

TI  - Prenatal diagnosis of cri du chat (5p-) syndrome in association with isolated 
      moderate bilateral ventriculomegaly.
PG  - 64-6
AB  - A case of prenatally detected cri du chat syndrome (5p-) is reported. Amniocentesis 
      was performed following an abnormal ultrasound finding of isolated moderate 
      bilateral ventriculomegaly. The karyotype showed a terminal deletion of the short 
      arm of chromosome 5 including the critical region 5p15 for cri du chat syndrome. 
      This was confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH). Isolated mild 
      ventriculomegaly may be a non-specific marker for cri du chat syndrome.

TI  - Neurological features and computed tomography of the brain in children with 
      ornithine carbamoyl transferase deficiency.
PG  - 28-34
AB  - The clinical features and the computed tomographic appearances of the brain in seven 
      children with ornithine carbamoyl transferase deficiency are described. Episodic 
      vomiting and drowsiness, acute encephalopathy, failure to thrive and developmental 
      retardation were common, but focal neurological symptoms and signs were also 
      observed. The CT appearances were non-specific with generalised or focal changes. 
      They were related to the severity, the duration and the age of onset of the 
      hyperammonaemia. Since the CT changes may suggest conditions other than metabolic 
      disease, the emergency investigation of a child with an encephalopathy should 
      include the estimation of plasma ammonium and, if elevated, the appropriate 
      investigations to establish the cause.

TI  - De novo duplication 1q32-q42: variability of phenotypic features in partial lq 
      trisomics.
PG  - 398-402
AB  - A de novo tandem duplication 1q32--q42 was observed in a 7-month-old mentally 
      retarded and malformed male infant. Karyotype-phenotype correlation in other similar 
      unbalanced trisomies has shown psychomotor retardation, micro- or retrognathia or 
      both, and low set or malpositioned ears to be the most common features associated 
      with this newly recognised syndrome. However, after reviewing patients with 
      duplication of regions 1q2, 3, and 4 and 1q2 and 3, it was concluded that similar 
      non-specific clinical features are also present in these 1q imbalances. On the 
      whole, a rather wide range in phenotypical expression has been observed in different 
      cases. Thus it is concluded that, at present, it is impossible to delineate the 
      profile of the syndromes resulting from partial 1q trisomies.

TI  - [A family with creatine transporter deficiency diagnosed with urinary 
      creatine/creatinine ratio and the family history: the third Japanese familial case].
PG  - 49-52
AB  - Creatine transporter deficiency (CRTR-D) is an X-linked disorder characterized by 
      hypotonia, developmental delay, and seizures. We report the third Japanese family 
      with CRTR-D. The proband was an 8-year-old boy who presented with hypotonia, severe 
      intellectual disability and two episodes of seizures associated with/without fever. 
      Among 7 siblings (4 males, 3 females), the eldest brother had severe intellectual 
      disability, epilepsy, and sudden death at 17 years of age, while 18-year-old third 
      elder brother had severe intellectual disability, autism, and drug-resistant 
      epilepsy. The proband's urinary creatine/creatinine ratio was increased. A reduced 
      creatine peak on brain magnetic resonance spectroscopy and a known pathogenic 
      mutation in the SLC6A8 gene (c.1661 C > T;p.Pro554Leu) confirmed the diagnosis of 
      CRTR-D. The same mutation was found in the third elder brother. Their mother was a 
      heterozygote. Symptoms of CRTR-D are non-specific. Urinary creatine/creatinine ratio 
      should be measured in patients with hypotonia, developmental delay, seizure and 
      autism whose family history indicates an X-linked inheritance.

AB  - Two genes responsible for a nonspecific form of X-linked mental retardation (MRX28 
      and MRX33) were localized by linkage analysis with 40 highly polymorphic DNA markers 
      situated along the entire the X chromosome. In family 1, the gene could be mapped 
      within a 14-cM interval at Xq28, distal to the recombining marker DXS1113 (MRX28). 
      The maximum LOD score was 2.75, with DXS52 at phi = .0. In family 2, the gene was 
      localized within a 30-cM interval at Xp11.4-22.12 between the recombining markers 
      DXS365 and MAOB, including the DMD gene (MRX33). Maximum LOD scores of 2.82 were 
      obtained with markers DMD-STR49, DMD-DysII, CYBB, and DXS1068.

TI  - Kabuki make-up (Niikawa-Kuroki) syndrome: a study of 16 non-Japanese cases.
PG  - 63-77
AB  - Kabuki make-up (Niikawa-Kuroki) syndrome has been described mainly in Japanese 
      patients. In this paper we report sixteen new cases from Europe and North America, 
      suggesting that Kabuki make-up syndrome may be more common outside of Japan than 
      supposed. Their features are compared with those of the Japanese patients and most 
      of our findings are similar to those previously reported. The facial phenotype is 
      specific and easily recognizable, regardless of ethnic origin. Postnatal growth 
      retardation and mild mental retardation are confirmed to be cardinal manifestations 
      of the syndrome. Skeletal anomalies were present in all cases but most of the 
      radiological changes were non-specific. The specificity of metacarpophalangeal 
      pattern profile is not confirmed. Conversely, dermatoglyphic analysis is helpful in 
      the diagnosis of this condition. Two differences have emerged between the Japanese 
      patients and those in this study. Firstly, two-thirds of the patients in this series 
      had significant neurological dysfunction other than mental retardation. Secondly, 
      joint hypermobility appears more common in non-Japanese patients. Confirmation of 
      these findings requires further studies.

TI  - Partial seizures with focal epileptogenic electroencephalographic patterns in three 
      related female patients with fragile-X syndrome.
PG  - 108-12
AB  - Epilepsy and abnormal electroencephalographic (EEG) patterns have been reported in 
      mentally retarded males with fragile-X syndrome, but the high incidence of epilepsy 
      in such persons has been recognized only recently. These individuals have focal 
      spikes in the EEG similar to the benign rolandic pattern. Female carriers have very 
      rarely been reported to have epilepsy or nonspecific abnormal EEG patterns. We 
      report partial seizures with a focal epileptogenic EEG pattern in two sisters and 
      their grandmother, who are all carriers of fragile-X syndrome. The sisters have mild 
      developmental delay, but the grandmother is of normal intelligence. The mother of 
      the two sisters is known to be a carrier of the fragile-X chromosome and is of 
      normal intelligence, with no history of seizures. It is important for physicians to 
      be aware of the possibility that females presenting with partial seizures of unknown 
      cause may be fragile-X carriers, and enquiry for a family history of intellectual 
      disability should be pursued.

TI  - Two unrelated children with distal long arm deletion of chromosome 7: clinical 
      features, cytogenetic and gene marker studies.
PG  - 228-37
AB  - Two phenotypically abnormal, unrelated children with deletion of the distal segment 
      of 7q (7q32 leads to pter) are described. In one instance the mother was the carrier 
      of a balanced translocation between chromosomes 6 and 7, and in the second case the 
      deletion was a de novo event. Their phenotype were compared to previously reported 
      cases and found to have many non-specific clinical features in common. Gene marker 
      studies for some of the genes tentatively localized to chromosome 7 showed no 
      anomalous segregation. The Hageman coagulation factor (Factor XII) activity in both 
      probands was normal, and heterozygosity for alleles of the Kidd blood group in the 
      first proband excludes assignment of the Kidd locus to the distal portion of 
      chromosome 7q.

TI  - Leigh disease with mitochondrial DNA A8344G mutation: case report and brief review.
PG  - 62-4
AB  - Leigh disease, subacute necrotizing encephalomyelopathy, is a neurodegenerative 
      disorder often seen in infancy or childhood but rarely reported in adults. Genetic 
      heterogeneity is well recognized, and the associated etiologies include both 
      mitochondrial and nuclear DNA defects. We describe an infant presenting with 
      developmental delay and then progressive multisystem disorder and neuroradiologic 
      features of Leigh disease. He and his maternal relatives all have the A8344G 
      mitochondrial DNA mutation. However, only minor clinical features are seen in his 
      maternal relatives, with migraine being the most common problem. Additionally the 
      A8344G mitochondrial DNA mutation is associated with spinocerebellar degeneration, 
      other nonspecific mitochondrial encephalomyopathies, atypical Charcot-Marie-Tooth 
      disease, and progressive external ophthalmoplegia. The A8344G mitochondrial DNA 
      mutation may present with Leigh disease or other different atypical clinical 
      features without myoclonic epilepsy and ragged red fibers.

TI  - Congenital hypoparathyroidism, seizure, extreme growth failure with developmental 
      delay and dysmorphic features--another case of this new syndrome.
PG  - 110-3
AB  - A 4-year-old Saudi female child with extreme failure to thrive, striking dysmorphic 
      features, developmental delay, congenital hypoparathyroidism, UTI, seizures, chronic 
      otitis media, chronic non-specific gastroenteritis and repeated life-threatening 
      infections was followed from birth. She was the product of first-cousin 
      consanguineous marriage. She had striking facies with frontal prominence, deep-set 
      eyes, depressed nasal bridge, beaked nose, long philtrum with thin upper lip, 
      micrognathia, large floppy ears, bifid uvula, and growth retardation with SD score 
      less than -2 for height, weight and head circumference. We believe these features 
      which include congenital hypoparathyroidism, severe growth failure and developmental 
      delay in the absence of chromosomal abnormality represent a newly described 
      genetically determined syndrome.

TI  - Partial duplication of 4q12q13 leads to a mild phenotype.
PG  - 51-3
AB  - We report on the second case of duplication (4)(q12q13) with microcephaly, mental 
      retardation, and minor facial anomalies. Duplications involving the distal region of 
      chromosome 4q are well described and share common clinical findings. However, 
      phenotypic abnormalities of duplications of the proximal portion of chromosome 4q 
      are relatively unknown. A comparison of the clinical manifestations of our patient 
      and the single published case suggests that the phenotype of this proximal 4q 
      duplication is relatively mild. This study emphasizes the need to perform chromosome 
      analysis in similar mildly affected/nonspecific cases.

TI  - MRX42: two linkage intervals, one in the pericentromeric region and one in Xq26, and 
      the impact for carrier risk estimation.
PG  - 18-25
AB  - A nonspecific X-linked mental retardation (MRX) family is reported with four mild to 
      moderately affected males and no intellectual impairment in their obligate carrier 
      mothers. Linkage analysis obtained the same multipoint lod score of 2.08 for two 
      intervals on the X chromosome already reported to be linked to other MRX and 
      syndromic X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) families: one pericentromeric and the 
      other at Xq26. Since the responsible gene is not yet characterized, haplotyping is 
      presently the only means available for carrier and prenatal testing for this form of 
      MRX. Carrier risk estimation using pedigree and haplotype data for five females at 
      risk is presented, and the difficulties of prenatal diagnosis given linkage to two 
      different regions is discussed.

AB  - There are no specific legislative provisions regulating sterilisation in any State 
      or Territory in Australia and there is a dearth of general case law on the subject. 
      To determine the law relating to sterilisation, we need to consider both criminal 
      and civil liability. In the absence of specific statutory provisions, it is 
      necessary to examine the common law and the possible application of non-specific 
      statutory provisions in both areas.

TI  - Use of verbal correction procedures with severely mentally retarded individuals: 
      aptitude-treatment interaction?
PG  - 294-301
AB  - The effects of verbal corrections on vocational training of severely mentally 
      retarded individuals have not been clear because of lack of measures that are 
      sensitive to differences in such persons' receptive-language skills. Using the 
      verbal subscale of the Trainee Performance Sample, we identified trainees of high 
      and low receptive-language skills. They were then randomly assigned to training 
      conditions involving specific and nonspecific verbal corrections from experienced 
      trainers. Results demonstrated that specific verbal corrections enhanced acquisition 
      by learners with higher receptive-language skills but did not do so for learners 
      with lower receptive-language skills. Implications of such an aptitude-treatment 
      interaction were discussed.

TI  - Phenotypic variation in two patients with a ring chromosome 22.
PG  - 305-10
AB  - Two severely mentally retarded patients with a ring chromosome 22 presented with 
      disparate phenotypes: one patient manifested only minimal dysmorphic features, 
      whereas the other had a distinctive pattern of anomalies consisting of an abnormal 
      skull configuration with mild maxillary hypoplasia, a large nose, thick full lips, a 
      protruding tongue, lymphedema, hypotonia and an unsteady gait. The findings in these 
      and previously reported patients indicate that a ring chromosome 22 is usually 
      associated with moderate to severe mental retardation, with a range of dysplastic 
      features from mild and nonspecific to more marked and distinctive.

TI  - Immune function in patients with chromosome deletions.
PG  - 179-85
AB  - Non-specific, cell-mediated and humoral immunity were evaluated in six patients with 
      different autosomal deletions, and in two patients with X-chromosome deletions. Six 
      had an increased number of bacterial, viral, and mycotic infections. Mild 
      disturbances were found in the immunological functions of almost every patient. 
      Granulocyte phagocytosis and killing of bacteria were normal in all patients. The 
      chemotactic response was increased in two, and normal in the others. The responses 
      to phytohaemagglutinin and pokeweed mitogen were normal in all patients and the 
      response to concanavalin A was decreased in one patient. The lymphocyte response to 
      purified protein derivative was decreased in the patients as a group when compared 
      to the controls (P less than 0 . 005), but normal to oidiomycin. The number of 
      acid-alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase positive cells was low in four patients. One 
      had a high titre of antinuclear and antithyroid antibodies. One had a low 
      concentration of serum IgA, C3 and C4. One had a high concentration of IgM. Two had 
      elevated levels of C3 and C4. Our results show that several different chromosomal 
      deletions are associated with immunological abnormality.

AB  - Two cases are described, one with a multifocal cranial and limb neuropathy of adult 
      onset associated with optic neuropathy, and the other with a diffuse demyelinating 
      neuropathy characterized by congenital cataract, mental retardation and progressive 
      lower limb paresis with an onset in childhood. Extensive investigation in both 
      failed to establish the causation. No family history of similar disorder was 
      obtained in either case. Nerve biopsy in both showed similar perineurial 
      abnormalities, the endoneurium being compartmentalized by hypertrophic perineurial 
      cells that exhibited dysplastic features. The appearances resemble those described 
      in a previously reported case of multifocal neuropathy and probably represent an 
      unusual but non-specific response to a peripheral neuropathy.

AB  - Altogether 110 children and adolescents aged 1 to 19 years with trichotillomania and 
      its rudiments were examined. The given phenomenon is shown to be similar to the 
      other forms of pathological habitual actions, especially to onychophagy. The author 
      demonstrates the nosological nonspecificity of trichotillomania and a great role 
      played in its origin of minimum brain dysfunction. Provides evidence for the concept 
      of the biological nature of the phenomenon. Stresses the psychopathological 
      heterogeneity of trichotillomania in different age groups with emphasis on the 
      preservation of the common pathogenetic nucleus--the conditioned reflex fixing of 
      the philogenetic behavioral models. Advances an opinion about the validity of 
      singling out the definition "a pathological habitual action" as an independent 
      psychopathological sign of certain varieties of trichotillomania.

TI  - Interdisciplinary treatment of encopresis in individuals with developmental 
      disorders: need and efficacy.
PG  - 279-327
AB  - The specific target behavior of encopresis in individuals with mental retardation 
      and developmental disorders (MR/DD) is not well-defined in the literature on 
      encopresis or in the literature on specific interventions with MR/DD populations. 
      The criteria for establishing a diagnosis of encopresis in individuals with MR/DD 
      are not clear. The literature on encopresis was reviewed for two factors: (1) 
      definitions according to three major definitional criteria of age, defecation 
      patterns and etiology; and (2) the relationship between etiology and intervention in 
      specific, MR/DD, and nonspecific populations. This review yielded no clinical 
      description of encopresis in MR/DD children, no guidelines for differentiating 
      encopresis from generalized developmental delay and no substantive treatment 
      guidelines. Although no definitions or treatment formulations specific to MR/DD were 
      identified, information and definitional guidelines derived from the general 
      literature on encopresis are relevant to identification, definition and treatment 
      issues for MR/DD populations. Interdisciplinary or team approaches are appropriate 
      for individuals with multiple problems or developmental disorders and intractable 
      encopresis. An interdisciplinary approach, neurodevelopmental-behavioral 
      intervention, which was successfully employed with a 5-year-old encopretic child 
      with multiple developmental problems, is described.

PG  - 157-62
AB  - Two female cases, 23- and 21-year-old, of supravalvular aortic stenosis associated 
      with cerebellar hypoplasia, retinitis pigmentosa and myopathy were reported. No 
      family history of mental retardation and cardiovascular anomalies was found. There 
      was no consanguinity between the parents. Pregnancy, labor and delivery were 
      reported to be uncomplicated. When they visited to our hospital at the age of 13 and 
      11 years, they had short stature, characteristic facial appearance (eg, wide mouth, 
      elongated philtrum, low nasal bridge and broad forehead) and supravalvular aortic 
      stenosis. Neurological examination disclosed mental retardation, retinitis 
      pigmentosa, muscle wasting and contracture of bilateral knee and ankle joints. Gait 
      was unsteady and bradykinetic. Their smooth pursuiting ocular movements were 
      saccadic. No nystagmus was recorded. Mild intention tremor was present. The muscles 
      were slightly hypotonic, but deep tendon reflexes were hyperactive in the lower 
      extremities. The sensory system was normal. Results of chromosome analysis and urine 
      amino acid analysis were normal. The serum creatine kinase was elevated to 
      1,000-3,000 U. Muscle biopsy revealed nonspecific myopathic changes such as 
      variability of fiber diameter in both fiber types. Neither cell infiltration nor 
      deposits of fat or glycogen was found. Cranial MRIs performed at the age of 22 and 
      20 years disclosed cerebellar hypoplasia and moderate enlargement of the fourth 
      ventricle. The two cases resembled clinically those of Williams syndrome, but the 
      MRI findings were not consistent with those of the syndrome. The disorder is 
      considered to be either Williams syndrome complicated by some other relatively rare 
      clinical features, or another heredofamilial disease partly resembling Williams 
      syndrome.

AB  - Under observation there were 27 families with two mentally deranged sibs in each 
      born by intellectually normal parents. In 2 of 24 families, the clinical picture of 
      the derangement in the sibs was different, and in the rest of 22 identical. In 3 
      families, a sex-linked recessive oligophrenia with a nonspecific clinical picture 
      was diagnosed. Prevalent were clinically non-differentiated forms of the 
      oligophrenia. In 2 families, the oligophrenia was combined with clinical signs of 
      hereditary defects of metabolism. Parents' consanguinity was registered in 4 
      families.

TI  - Balanced t(8;9)(q12;q33)pat carrier with phenotypic abnormalities attributable to a 
      de novo terminal deletion of the long arm of chromosome 7.
PG  - 101-7
AB  - A girl observed from birth to age 16 months had multiple congenital anomalies 
      including growth and developemental retardation, microcephaly (-4SD), bulbous nose, 
      prominent lips and philtrum, esotropia, latent hypermetropia, and spasticity. 
      Chromosome analysis showed her to be a balanced carrier of a t(8;9)(q12;q33)pat 
      translocation. In addition, she had a de novo deletion of a distal segment of the 
      long arm of chromosome 7. Seven previously reported cases with deletions involving 
      7q were reviewed and had a number of nonspecific features in common, with 
      microcephaly of a comparable degree in one of these. Studies of the Kidd (Jk) blood 
      groups and Hageman factor were done because of the tentative assignment of their 
      respective loci to distal 7q. Location of the Kidd (Jk) locus on the deleted segment 
      can be excluded on the basis of heterozygosity of the proposita for the a and b 
      alleles. Hageman factor was not decreased, which suggests that this locus is also 
      not on the deleted segment.

AB  - We report a 6-year-old mildly retarded boy with trisomy 18 in 44% of peripheral 
      lymphocytes. He had mild nonspecific dysmorphic features, microcephaly, micropenis 
      with cryptorchidism and postnatal overgrowth. Trisomy 18 mosaicism was confirmed by 
      a fluorescent in situ hybridization study. Ten previous reports of trisomy 18 
      mosaicism with normal or subnormal intelligence have been described but only one 
      case of trisomy 18 mosaicism with high stature has been reported.

TI  - Two sibs with different phenotypes due to adjacent-1 segregation of a subtle 
      translocation t(4;5)(p16.3;p15.3)mat.
PG  - 387-91
AB  - High-resolution chromosome banding and in situ hybridization with combined cosmid 
      and alphoid sequence probes were used to delineate a very small reciprocal 
      translocation in a mother and her two children. The first child has a 
      46,XX,der(4)t(4;5)(p16.3;p15.3)mat and thus has a deletion of 4p16.3-->pter and a 
      duplication of 5p15.3-->pter (most likely 5p15.31-->pter). Clinical findings include 
      marked growth retardation, developmental delay, seizure disorder, microcephaly, 
      unruly hair, broad nasal tip, downturned mouth, narrow palate, 11 pairs of ribs, 
      mild right club foot, and a deep sacral dimple. Thus, this child has only a few 
      non-specific manifestations of Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome. The second child has a 
      46,XY,der(5)t(4;5)(p16.3;p15.3)mat; thus a deletion of 5p15.3-->pter and a 
      duplication of 4p16.3-->pter. He has failure to thrive, developmental delay, 
      microcephaly, sparse hair, horizontal nystagmus, short upturned nose with flared 
      nostrils, thin lips with overhanging upper lip, long fingers and toes, and 
      hypertonicity. Findings in the second patient are not suggestive of cri du chat 
      syndrome (del 5p). The mother is phenotypically normal. This translocation will be 
      useful in mapping genes and markers on the 4p and 5p chromosomal regions.

TI  - Oligophrenin 1 mutations frequently cause X-linked mental retardation with 
      cerebellar hypoplasia.
PG  - 1364-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mutations of oligophrenin 1, one of the first genes identified in 
      nonspecific X-linked mental retardation (MRX), have been described in patients with 
      moderate to severe cognitive impairment and predominant cerebellar hypoplasia, in 
      the vermis. OBJECTIVE: To further delineate the phenotypic and mutational spectrum 
      of the syndrome, by screening oligophrenin 1 in two cohorts of male patients with 
      mental retardation (MR) with or without known posterior fossa anomalies. METHODS: 
      Clinical examination, cognitive testing, MRI studies, and mutational analysis 
      (denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and direct sequencing) on blood lymphocytes 
      were performed in 213 unrelated affected individuals: 196 patients classified as MRX 
      and 17 patients with MR and previously detected cerebellar anomalies. RESULTS: Four 
      novel oligophrenin 1 mutations were identified. In the MRX group, two nonsense 
      mutations were detected. In the MR group, two mutations were found: a deletion of 
      exons 16 to 17 and a splice site mutation. All patients shared characteristic 
      clinical, radiologic, and distinctive features with a degree of intrafamilial 
      variability in motor and cognitive deficits. CONCLUSIONS: Oligophrenin 1 mutations 
      were found in 12% (2/17) of individuals with mental retardatin and known cerebellar 
      anomalies and in 1% (2/196) of the X-linked mental retardation group.

LID - 10.1016/j.ridd.2013.09.007 [doi]
AB  - Frequency and type of incontinence and variables associated with incontinence were 
      assessed in individuals with Angelman syndrome (AS; n=71) and in a matched control 
      group (n=69) consisting of individuals with non-specific intellectual disability 
      (ID). A Dutch version of the "Parental Questionnaire: Enuresis/Urinary Incontinence" 
      (Beetz, von Gontard, & Lettgen, 1994) was administered and information on primary 
      caretakers' perspectives regarding each individual's incontinence was gathered. 
      Results show that diurnal incontinence and fecal incontinence during the day more 
      frequently occurred in the control group than in the AS group. In both groups, 
      nocturnal enuresis was the most common form of incontinence. More incontinence was 
      seen in individuals with AS who were younger, had a lower level of adaptive 
      functioning and/or had epilepsy. Individuals with AS were able to stay dry for 
      longer periods of time than the controls and often showed both in-toilet urination 
      and urinary accidents during the day, whereas accidents and correct voids during the 
      day were more set apart in the control group. Also, persons with AS had a lower 
      micturition frequency implying possible voiding postponement. Both groups showed 
      high rates of LUTS (lower urinary tract symptoms) possibly indicative of functional 
      bladder disorders such as voiding postponement, dysfunctional voiding, or even an 
      underactive bladder. In general, most primary caretakers reported severe 
      intellectual disability as the main cause for urinary incontinence. Based on these 
      results incontinence does not appear to be part of the behavioral phenotype of 
      Angelman syndrome. Therefore, pediatric or urologic diagnostics and treatment are 
      recommended for all persons with incontinence and intellectual disability. Further 
      implications for practice and research are given.

AB  - Numerous genetic syndromes that include intellectual disability (ID) have been 
      reported. Recently, HECW2 mutations were detected in patients with ID and growth 
      development disorders. Four de novo missense mutations have been reported. Here, we 
      report a Japanese girl with Rett-like symptoms of severe ID, hypotonia, refractory 
      epilepsy, and stereotypical hand movement (hand tapping, flapping, and wringing) 
      after the age of 1 year. Characteristically, she had cortical visual impairment. She 
      had difficulty swallowing since the age of 4 years, and diminished activity was 
      noticeable since the age of 12 years, suggesting neurodevelopmental regression. She 
      has no acquired microcephaly, and brain magnetic resonance imaging showed 
      non-specific mild cerebral and cerebellar atrophy without progression over time. 
      Genetic analyses of MECP2, CDKL5, and FOXG1 were negative. Whole-exome sequencing 
      analysis revealed a known de novo mutation (c.3988C > T) in HECW2. The 
      characteristics of her clinical symptoms are severe cortical visual impairment and 
      Rett-like phenotype such as involuntary movements and regression. This is the first 
      report that patients with HECW2 mutation could show Rett-like feature.

AB  - Two major decapping enzymes are involved in the decay of eukaryotic mRNA, Dcp2 and 
      DcpS. Despite the detection of robust DcpS decapping activity in cell extract, 
      minimal to no decapping is detected from human Dcp2 (hDcp2) in extract. We now 
      demonstrate that one reason for the lack of detectable hDcp2 activity in extract is 
      due to the presence of inhibitory trans factor(s). Furthermore, we demonstrate that 
      a previously identified testis-specific protein of unknown function implicated in 
      nonspecific X-linked mental retardation, VCX-A, can function as an inhibitor of 
      hDcp2 decapping in vitro and in cells. VCX-A is a noncanonical cap-binding protein 
      that binds to capped RNA but not cap structure lacking an RNA. Its cap association 
      is enhanced by hDcp2 to further augment the ability of VCX-A to inhibit decapping. 
      Our data demonstrate that VCX-A can regulate mRNA stability and that it is an 
      example of a tissue-specific decapping regulator.

TI  - Psychiatric manifestations in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
PG  - e302
LID - 10.1038/tp.2013.76 [doi]
AB  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a rare and severe, but treatable, inborn 
      disorder of bile acid biosynthesis and sterol storage with autosomal recessive 
      inheritance and variable clinical presentation. CTX treatment consists of 
      chenodeoxycholic acid and must be started as early as possible to prevent permanent 
      disability. Psychiatric manifestations are rare and non-specific, and often lead to 
      significant diagnostic and treatment delay. Therefore, better recognition of the 
      gamut of psychiatric manifestations in CTX can diminish the risk of misdiagnosis and 
      irreversible neurological deterioration. We hereby describe the psychiatric features 
      in CTX. A complete review of all published cases of CTX in the medical literature 
      was undertaken and the case reports with psychiatric presentation were collected and 
      analyzed. We also describe the psychiatric features in relation to the neurological 
      semeiology in six patients with CTX diagnosed at the La Salpêtrière Hospital. We 
      conclude that psychiatric manifestations in CTX follow a bimodal/bitemporal pattern, 
      appearing early in the disease course in the form of a behavioral/personality 
      disorder associated with learning difficulties or mental retardation, or manifesting 
      in advanced disease in the setting of dementia as rich neuropsychiatric syndromes, 
      such as frontal, orbitofrontal or frontotemporal syndromes of cortico-subcortical 
      dementia encompassing behavioral/personality disturbance, affective/mood disorders 
      or psychotic disorders. Behavioral/personality disturbance in childhood or 
      adolescence, especially when accompanied by learning difficulties, should therefore 
      lead to further investigation to exclude CTX, as early diagnosis and treatment is 
      critical for prognosis.

PG  - 331-8
AB  - We compared cognitive performance and hippocampal volumes using magnetic resonance 
      imaging (MRI) in adult fragile-X [fra(X)] males and females with either premutation 
      (pM) or full mutation (fM) (n = 10 in all groups). Cognitive performance of fM males 
      in the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised was worse than that of pM males, 
      and the deficits in fM females were qualitatively similar, but less severe. In a 
      visual memory test, both fM groups were impaired. In a list learning test, fM males 
      were impaired in the learning phase and in delayed recognition. In a logical memory 
      test, fM males and females were not significantly different from pM subjects. 
      Hippocampal volumes normalized for intracranial or brain area did not significantly 
      differ between fM and pM groups. However, positive correlations between left 
      normalized hippocampal volumes and performance in many delayed memory tests observed 
      in pM subjects were absent in fM subjects. Furthermore, in > 50% of the fM subjects, 
      nonspecific changes, such as enlargement of ventricles and perivascular spaces, 
      focal hyperintensities in temporal pole white matter, and/or subjectively assessed 
      atypical appearance of hippocampal morphology, were observed in MRI. The data 
      suggest minor abnormalities in temporal lobe structures in adult fra(X) subjects 
      with fM.

AB  - Human chromosome carry different fragile sites, but the most interesting one is the 
      fragile X chromosome, especially in relation to mental retardation. In this report 
      we present micronucleus formation in 5 individuals with the fragile X syndrome and 
      11 control subjects whose lymphocytes were cultured under 1) hydroxyurea treatment 
      condition suitable for the increasing expression of the fraXq27, 2) control 
      conditions. It has been found that hydroxyurea (HU) added to the final concentration 
      1.3 X 10(-5)M increases the frequency of the fraXq and micronucleus formation in 
      comparison with culture without HU. The same concentration of HU has induced neither 
      "nonspecific" "spontaneous" chromosomal breakage nor micronucleus formation in the 
      control subjects.

TI  - The X-linked mental retardation protein oligophrenin-1 is required for dendritic 
      spine morphogenesis.
PG  - 364-72
AB  - Of 11 genes involved in nonspecific X-linked mental retardation (MRX), three encode 
      regulators or effectors of the Rho GTPases, suggesting an important role for Rho 
      signaling in cognitive function. It remains unknown, however, how mutations in 
      Rho-linked genes lead to MRX. Here we report that oligophrenin-1, a Rho-GTPase 
      activating protein that is absent in a family affected with MRX, is required for 
      dendritic spine morphogenesis. Using RNA interference and antisense RNA approaches, 
      we show that knock-down of oligophrenin-1 levels in CA1 neurons in rat hippocampal 
      slices significantly decreases spine length. This phenotype can be recapitulated 
      using an activated form of RhoA and rescued by inhibiting Rho-kinase, indicating 
      that reduced oligophrenin-1 levels affect spine length by increasing RhoA and 
      Rho-kinase activities. We further demonstrate an interaction between oligophrenin-1 
      and the postsynaptic adaptor protein Homer. Our findings provide the first insight 
      into how mutations in a Rho-linked MRX gene may compromise neuronal function.

TI  - Classic Rett syndrome in a boy with R133C mutation of MECP2.
PG  - 439-42
AB  - About 80% of female patients with Rett syndrome (RTT) display a mutation in the 
      methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2) gene, but most males with MECP2 mutation 
      experience severe fatal encephalopathy or non-specific X-linked mental retardation 
      (XLMR). The existence of male RTT has been extensively discussed. We report herein a 
      boy with classic RTT in a family with a missense mutation in MECP2. The mother 
      exhibited slight mental retardation and was a carrier for R133C. The patient could 
      stand with support at 12-months-old, and stereotypic hand movements appeared at 
      3-years-old. He became bed-ridden by 8-years-old. The R133C mutation was present in 
      MECP2 without somatic mosaicism. A sister with R133C displayed classic RTT. The 
      R133C mutation has been detected in female patients with classic and preserved 
      speech variant RTT, but not in males with non-specific XLMR. These results suggest 
      that clinical phenotypes caused by DNA mutation in MECP2 are determined by position 
      of the mutation in the gene, and R133 represents a critical amino acid residue in 
      the induction of RTT symptoms in humans.

TI  - Large national series of patients with Xq28 duplication involving MECP2: Delineation 
      of brain MRI abnormalities in 30 affected patients.
PG  - 116-29
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.a.37384 [doi]
AB  - Xq28 duplications encompassing MECP2 have been described in male patients with a 
      severe neurodevelopmental disorder associated with hypotonia and spasticity, severe 
      learning disability, stereotyped movements, and recurrent pulmonary infections. We 
      report on standardized brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data of 30 affected 
      patients carrying an Xq28 duplication involving MECP2 of various sizes (228 kb to 
      11.7 Mb). The aim of this study was to seek recurrent malformations and attempt to 
      determine whether variations in imaging features could be explained by differences 
      in the size of the duplications. We showed that 93% of patients had brain MRI 
      abnormalities such as corpus callosum abnormalities (n = 20), reduced volume of the 
      white matter (WM) (n = 12), ventricular dilatation (n = 9), abnormal increased 
      hyperintensities on T2-weighted images involving posterior periventricular WM 
      (n = 6), and vermis hypoplasia (n = 5). The occipitofrontal circumference varied 
      considerably between >+2SD in five patients and <-2SD in four patients. Among the 
      nine patients with dilatation of the lateral ventricles, six had a duplication 
      involving L1CAM. The only patient harboring bilateral posterior subependymal nodular 
      heterotopia also carried an FLNA gene duplication. We could not demonstrate a 
      correlation between periventricular WM hyperintensities/delayed myelination and 
      duplication of the IKBKG gene. We thus conclude that patients with an Xq28 
      duplication involving MECP2 share some similar but non-specific brain abnormalities. 
      These imaging features, therefore, could not constitute a diagnostic clue. The 
      genotype-phenotype correlation failed to demonstrate a relationship between the 
      presence of nodular heterotopia, ventricular dilatation, WM abnormalities, and the 
      presence of FLNA, L1CAM, or IKBKG, respectively, in the duplicated segment.

TI  - Brain white matter abnormalities associated with copy number variants.
PG  - 93-103
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.a.61389 [doi]
AB  - White matter (WM) signal abnormalities are demonstrated in various 
      neurodevelopmental disorders on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The pattern 
      of WM abnormalities can aid in the diagnostic process. This study aims to 
      characterize the WM changes found in microdeletion/microduplication syndromes. 
      Thirteen patients with neurodevelopmental disorders due to copy number variations 
      were collected from a cohort of children with evidence of WM abnormalities on brain 
      MRI, in two medical centers. A pediatric neuroradiologist blindly interpreted the 
      MRI scans. Clinical and genetic findings were retrospectively extracted from the 
      medical records. WM changes included: multifocal (10/13) periventricular (12/13) and 
      subcortical (5/13) signal abnormalities and WM volume loss (6/13). Dysgenesis of the 
      corpus callosum was depicted in 12/13. The main clinical features were: global 
      developmental delay (13/13), hypotonia (11/13), epilepsy (10/13), dysmorphic 
      features (9/13), microcephaly (6/13), short stature (6/13), and systemic involvement 
      (6/13). We showed that different chromosomal micro-rearrangement syndromes share 
      similar MRI patterns of nonspecific multifocal predominantly periventricular WM 
      changes associated with corpus callosum dysgenesis with or without WM and gray 
      matter loss. Hence, the association of these features in a patient evaluated for 
      global developmental delay/intellectual disability suggests a chromosomal 
      micro-rearrangement syndrome, and a chromosomal microarray analysis should be 
      performed.

TI  - [Molecular diagnosis of fragile X syndrome with polymerase chain reaction: 
      application of a diagnostic protocol in 50 families from northern Spain].
PG  - 331-9
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to develop a rapid, non-radioactive and 
      effective method for the molecular diagnosis of fragile X syndrome (FXS) by the 
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of the CGG repeat and to establish a protocol to be 
      used in: a)ruling out FXS in patients with non-specific mental retardation; 
      b)determining the exact genotype of affected individuals; c)studying all at-risk 
      individuals from families with FXS and identifying asymptomatic carriers, and 
      d)offering accurate genetic and reproductive counselling to families with FXS. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Samples from 438 individuals from 50 families with FXS were 
      studied using three different PCR tests: the first to detect ethidium bromide 
      through ultraviolet light, the second to detect digoxigenin and CSPD after blotting 
      and hybridisation with the (CGG)5 oligoprobe, and the third to amplify and detect 
      the DXS548 microsatellite. RESULTS: Of the 438 individuals studied, 121 had full 
      mutations (60 males and 61 females), 86 had pre-mutations (7 males and 79 females), 
      16 showed mosaic patterns and 215 had no mutations. PCR techniques amplified up to 
      120-150 repeats, and direct study with probes was required when no bands or only one 
      band was detected in females. PCR was more accurate than genomic DNA Southern blot 
      analysis in pre-mutated carriers. In one family, recombination between the FRAXA 
      locus and the DXS548 microsatellite was found. CONCLUSIONS: These non-radioactive 
      PCR protocols permit rapid and accurate diagnosis of FXS. They and are especially 
      useful in prenatal diagnosis and in the identification of carriers.

TI  - Cardiomyopathy in Coffin-Lowry syndrome.
PG  - 176-8
AB  - Coffin-Lowry syndrome (CLS) is a rare but well-documented X-linked disorder 
      characterized by small size, developmental delay/mental retardation, and 
      characteristic facial and skeletal findings in affected males. The phenotype in 
      affected females is far more variable and can include developmental differences, 
      obesity, and characteristic facial and skeletal differences. Cardiac anomalies are 
      reported in less than 20% of affected males, with cardiomyopathy being one of the 
      rare but reported complications of this disorder. However, cardiomyopathy is not 
      well characterized in CLS. Here, we report on a 14-year-old boy with physical and 
      developmental findings consistent with CLS who presented with a relatively sudden 
      onset of signs of congestive heart failure due to a restrictive cardiomyopathy; an 
      endomyocardial biopsy demonstrated non-specific hypertrophic myocyte alterations 
      consistent with cardiomyopathy. This is the first description of the histology and 
      electron microscopy of cardiomyopathy in CLS.

TI  - A 3-base pair deletion, c.9711_9713del, in DMD results in intellectual disability 
      without muscular dystrophy.
PG  - 480-5
LID - 10.1038/ejhg.2013.169 [doi]
AB  - We have identified a deletion of 3 base pairs in the dystrophin gene (DMD), 
      c.9711_9713del, in a family with nonspecific X-linked intellectual disability (ID) 
      by sequencing of the exons of 86 known X-linked ID genes. This in-frame deletion 
      results in the deletion of a single-amino-acid residue, Leu3238, in the 
      brain-specific isoform Dp71 of dystrophin. Linkage analysis supported causality as 
      the mutation was present in the 7.6 cM linkage interval on Xp22.11-Xp21.1 with a 
      maximum positive LOD score of 2.41 (MRX85 locus). Molecular modeling predicts that 
      the p.(Leu3238del) deletion results in the destabilization of the C-terminal domain 
      of dystrophin and hence reduces the ability to interact with β-dystroglycan. 
      Correspondingly, Dp71 protein levels in lymphoblastoid cells from the index patient 
      are 6.7-fold lower than those in control cell lines (P=0.08). Subsequent 
      determination of the creatine kinase levels in blood of the index patient showed a 
      mild but significant elevation in serum creatine kinase, which is in line with 
      impaired dystrophin function. In conclusion, we have identified the first DMD 
      mutation in Dp71 that results in ID without muscular dystrophy.

TI  - Prevalence, classification, and severity of epilepsy and epileptic syndromes in 
      children.
PG  - 1275-82
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the point prevalence of active childhood epilepsy in a defined 
      area and evaluate the usefulness of ILAE classification of seizures, and 
      epilepsies/syndromes with special interest in severe epilepsies. METHODS: By using 
      the latest ILAE International Classification of Epileptic Seizures (ICES, 1981) and 
      Epilepsies and Epileptic Syndromes (ICE, 1989), we determined the age- and 
      sex-specific prevalence rates of epilepsy, type of seizures, epilepsies, and 
      recognizable epileptic syndromes, as well as the proportion of severe cases in each 
      seizure/epilepsy/syndrome category in all children 0-15 years of age from a 
      geographically defined area in Finland. All medical records, neurophysiological 
      recordings and available clinical data were reviewed retrospectively. RESULTS: Point 
      prevalence of active epilepsy on December 12, 1992 was 3.94 per 1,000. According to 
      ICES/ICE, we were able to classify 96% of seizures and 90% of epilepsies and 
      syndromes. Generalized seizure and epilepsy/syndrome types were more prevalent in 
      children 0-6 years of age and partial/localization-related in children 6-15 years of 
      age. Epilepsy was intractable in 17% of all cases and correlated significantly with 
      symptomatic etiology and early onset of epilepsy, as well as with additional 
      neuroimpairments. CONCLUSIONS: A considerable number of cases fell into the 
      nonspecific categories of ICE, which limits the value of present epilepsy/syndrome 
      classification in terms of prognosis, prediction, and indication for special 
      investigations in individual cases. A number of intractable cases was relatively 
      low, indicating good prognosis in many childhood epilepsies, especially when 
      additional neuroimpairments are absent.

      syndrome.
PG  - 560-6
AB  - Neurological complications occurred in 6 children, aged 6 months to 5 years, with 
      acquired immune deficiency syndrome who were followed for 14 months. The most 
      frequent manifestations included encephalopathies, acquired microcephaly, and 
      pyramidal tract signs. Computed tomographic examinations showed variable degrees of 
      cortical atrophy with ventricular dilatation and calcification. Electrophysiological 
      abnormalities were demonstrated. Two children had documented central nervous system 
      infections. Neurological deterioration resulted in dementia in 3 children. Cognitive 
      impairment and developmental delays were evident in the other 3. Postmortem 
      examination of the 3 children who died showed subacute cytomegalovirus encephalitis 
      in 1; nonspecific hemispheric white matter changes, calcific vasopathy of the basal 
      ganglia, and striking bilateral corticospinal tract degeneration in the second; and 
      extensive calcific vasopathy of the basal ganglia and frontal centrum semiovale, and 
      bilateral attenuation of the frontopontine and corticospinal tracts in the third.

AB  - Fragile X [fra (X)] syndrome is a frequently encountered form of mental retardation 
      and is inherited as an X-linked semi-dominant trait with reduced penetrance. We 
      report here the characterization of a highly polymorphic dinucleotide repeat, DXS 
      548, which is approximately 150 kb proximal to the fra(X) site and the associated 
      FMR-1 gene. DXS 548 is tightly linked to the fra (X) syndrome locus (FRAXA) without 
      recombination (LOD = 9.07 with q of 0) in selected families with crossovers between 
      FRAXA and very closely linked flanking markers. This dinucleotide repeat could be 
      useful in determining the parental origin of a new fra (X) mutations and evaluating 
      the role of FMR-1 in X-linked non-specific mental retardation.

AB  - Creatine is the main source of energy for the brain. Primary creatine deficiency 
      syndromes (PCDSs) are inborn error of metabolism of creatine synthesis. Symptoms of 
      central nervous system involvement are the most common clinical manifestations in 
      these disorders. We reviewed medical records of all genetically confirmed patients 
      diagnosed by whole exome sequencing who were referred to Myelin and 
      Neurodegenerative Disorders Clinic, Children's Medical Center, Tehran, Iran, from 
      May 2016 to Dec 2018. A literature review was conducted on clinical and genomic 
      variability of PCDS to compare our patients with previously reported cases. We 
      report two patients with creatine deficiency among a cohort of 550 registered cases 
      out of which 200 patients had a genetically confirmed neurodegenerative disorder 
      diagnosis. The main complain in the first patient with creatine transporter (CRTR) 
      deficiency was seizure and genetic study in this patient identified a novel 
      hemizygote variant of "c.92 > T; p.Pro31Leu" in the first exon of SLC6A8 gene. The 
      second patient with guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT) deficiency had an 
      unknown motor and speech delay as the striking manifestation and molecular assay 
      revealed a novel homozygote variant of "c.134G > A; p.Trp45*" in the first exon of 
      GAMT gene. PCDSs usually are associated with nonspecific neurologic symptoms. The 
      first presented case had a mean delayed diagnosis of 5 years. Therefore, in children 
      with unexplained neurologic features including developmental delay and/or 
      regression, mental disability and repeated seizures without any significant findings 
      in metabolic studies, PCDSs can be considered as a differential diagnosis and 
      molecular analysis can be helpful for the precise diagnosis and treatment.

AB  - Spermine synthase (SMS) is an enzyme which function is to convert spermidine into 
      spermine. It was shown that gene defects resulting in amino acid changes of the wild 
      type SMS cause Snyder-Robinson syndrome, which is a mild-to-moderate mental 
      disability associated with osteoporosis, facial asymmetry, thin habitus, hypotonia, 
      and a nonspecific movement disorder. These disease-causing missense mutations were 
      demonstrated, both in silico and in vitro, to affect the wild type function of SMS 
      by either destabilizing the SMS dimer/monomer or directly affecting the hydrogen 
      bond network of the active site of SMS. In contrast to these studies, here we report 
      an artificial engineering of a more efficient SMS variant by transferring sequence 
      information from another organism. It is confirmed experimentally that the variant, 
      bearing four amino acid substitutions, is catalytically more active than the wild 
      type. The increased functionality is attributed to enhanced monomer stability, 
      lowering the pKa of proton donor catalytic residue, optimized spatial distribution 
      of the electrostatic potential around the SMS with respect to substrates, and 
      increase of the frequency of mechanical vibration of the clefts presumed to be the 
      gates toward the active sites. The study demonstrates that wild type SMS is not 
      particularly evolutionarily optimized with respect to the reaction spermidine → 
      spermine. Having in mind that currently there are no variations (non-synonymous 
      single nucleotide polymorphism, nsSNP) detected in healthy individuals, it can be 
      speculated that the human SMS function is precisely tuned toward its wild type and 
      any deviation is unwanted and disease-causing.

AB  - PURPOSE: Children with Down syndrome (DS) have a unique developmental profile with 
      an increased risk for co-morbid neurodevelopmental diagnoses, including autism 
      spectrum disorder (ASD), anxiety, and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder 
      (ADHD), among others. A delay in a diagnosis of these conditions can impact the 
      health and psychosocial wellbeing of the child and family. The purpose of this study 
      was to assess identification of secondary co-morbid neurodevelopmental diagnoses 
      within an academic DS specialty Clinic. DESIGN AND METHODS: A retrospective chart 
      review of secondary co-morbid neurodevelopmental diagnoses including children with 
      DS ages 2 to 17 years old, with a visit encounter in a pediatric DS specialty clinic 
      between January 2018 to August 2019 was conducted. Comparisons included diagnoses 
      identified before (T1) and after (T2) inclusion of developmental behavioral 
      specialists as pediatric DS providers. Two sample t-tests, Chi-square test and 
      Fisher's exact t-test were utilized to compare categorical and non-categorical 
      variables. RESULTS: 145 children were identified in T1 of which 51.7% were male. 225 
      children were seen in T2, 56.0% were male. Increased detection of several co-morbid 
      conditions occurred between T1 and T2 including language disorder (p < 0.0001), 
      intellectual disability (p < 0.0001), and non-specific developmental/behavioral 
      diagnoses (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Developmental/behavioral assessment is integral 
      for detection of co-morbid conditions among a pediatric DS population and prevention 
      of diagnostic overshadowing. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Interprofessional teams, 
      including pediatric nurse practitioners, play a key role in providing health 
      supervision and assessment for a pediatric DS population.

AB  - Identification of over 500 epigenetic regulators in humans raises an interesting 
      question regarding how chromatin dysregulation contributes to different diseases. 
      Bromodomain and PHD finger-containing protein 1 (BRPF1) is a multivalent chromatin 
      regulator possessing three histone-binding domains, one non-specific DNA-binding 
      module, and several motifs for interacting with and activating three lysine 
      acetyltransferases. Genetic analyses of fish brpf1 and mouse Brpf1 have uncovered an 
      important role in skeletal, hematopoietic, and brain development, but it remains 
      unclear how BRPF1 is linked to human development and disease. Here, we describe an 
      intellectual disability disorder in ten individuals with inherited or de novo 
      monoallelic BRPF1 mutations. Symptoms include infantile hypotonia, global 
      developmental delay, intellectual disability, expressive language impairment, and 
      facial dysmorphisms. Central nervous system and spinal abnormalities are also seen 
      in some individuals. These clinical features overlap with but are not identical to 
      those reported for persons with KAT6A or KAT6B mutations, suggesting that BRPF1 
      targets these two acetyltransferases and additional partners in humans. Functional 
      assays showed that the resulting BRPF1 variants are pathogenic and impair 
      acetylation of histone H3 at lysine 23, an abundant but poorly characterized 
      epigenetic mark. We also found a similar deficiency in different lines of 
      Brpf1-knockout mice. These data indicate that aberrations in the chromatin regulator 
      gene BRPF1 cause histone H3 acetylation deficiency and a previously unrecognized 
      intellectual disability syndrome.

TI  - A comparative study of cognition and brain anatomy between two neurodevelopmental 
      disorders: 22q11.2 deletion syndrome and Williams syndrome.
PG  - 1034-44
LID - 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2008.10.029 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) is associated with intellectual 
      disability, poor social interaction and a high prevalence of psychosis. However, to 
      date there have been no studies comparing cognition and neuroanatomical 
      characteristics of 22q11DS with other syndromes to investigate if the cognitive 
      strengths and difficulties and neuroanatomical differences associated with 22q11DS 
      are specific to the syndrome. Hence, it is difficult to know if the observed 
      features of 22q11DS are simply due to a non-specific effect of having a genetic 
      disorder or are specific to 22q11DS. METHODS: In this study, cognition and brain 
      anatomy of 12 children with 22q11DS were compared to 12 age, gender and full scale 
      IQ (FSIQ) matched children with William syndrome (WS) in order to investigate which 
      cognitive and neuroanatomical features are specific to 22q11DS. We chose WS since 
      the literature suggests that both groups have areas of 
      physical/cognitive/behavioural overlap but as yet there has been no direct 
      comparison of the two groups. RESULTS: Despite being matched on FSIQ the WS group 
      had significantly greater impairment than those with 22q11DS on tests of Performance 
      IQ, while performing significantly better on tasks measuring verbal, social and 
      facial processing skills. Moreover there were significant differences in brain 
      anatomy. Despite similar overall brain volumes, midline anomalies were more common 
      among the 22q11DS group, and regional differences such as increased striatal volumes 
      and reduced cerebellar volumes in the 22q11DS group were detected. CONCLUSIONS: 
      These findings suggest that although the behavioural phenotype is similar in some 
      aspects there are key differences in cognition and neuroanatomy between the two 
      groups. Different neuropsychological profiles need to be considered when designing 
      educational frameworks for working with these children.

TI  - Dissecting FMR1, the protein responsible for fragile X syndrome, in its structural 
      and functional domains.
PG  - 1248-58
AB  - FMR1 is an RNA-binding protein that is either absent or mutated in patients affected 
      by the fragile X syndrome, the most common inherited cause of mental retardation in 
      humans. Sequence analysis of the FMR1 protein has suggested that RNA binding is 
      related to the presence of two K-homologous (KH) modules and an RGG box. However, no 
      attempt has been so far made to map the RNA-binding sites along the protein sequence 
      and to identify possible differential RNA-sequence specificity. In the present 
      article, we describe work done to dissect FMR1 into regions with structurally and 
      functionally distinct properties. A semirational approach was followed to identify 
      four regions: an N-terminal stretch of 200 amino acids, the two KH regions, and a 
      C-terminal stretch. Each region was produced as a recombinant protein, purified, and 
      probed for its state of folding by spectroscopical techniques. Circular dichroism 
      and NMR spectra of the N-terminus show formation of secondary structure with a 
      strong tendency to aggregate. Of the two homologous KH motifs, only the first one is 
      folded whereas the second remains unfolded even when it is extended both N- and 
      C-terminally. The C-terminus is, as expected from its amino acid composition, 
      nonglobular. Binding assays were then performed using the 4-nt homopolymers. Our 
      results show that only the first KH domain but not the second binds to RNA, and 
      provide the first direct evidence for RNA binding of both the N-terminal and the 
      C-terminal regions. RNA binding for the N-terminus could not be predicted from 
      sequence analysis because no known RNA-binding motif is identifiable in this region. 
      Different sequence specificity was observed for the fragments: both the N-terminus 
      of the protein and KH1 bind preferentially to poly-(rG). The C-terminal region, 
      which contains the RGG box, is nonspecific, as it recognizes the bases with 
      comparable affinity. We therefore conclude that FMR1 is a protein with multiple 
      sites of interaction with RNA: sequence specificity is most likely achieved by the 
      whole block that comprises the first approximately 400 residues, whereas the 
      C-terminus provides a nonspecific binding surface.

TI  - A partial loss of function allele of methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 predicts a human 
      neurodevelopmental syndrome.
PG  - 1718-27
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddn062 [doi]
AB  - Rett Syndrome, an X-linked dominant neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by 
      regression of language and hand use, is primarily caused by mutations in 
      methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2). Loss of function mutations in MECP2 are also 
      found in other neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism, Angelman-like syndrome 
      and non-specific mental retardation. Furthermore, duplication of the MECP2 genomic 
      region results in mental retardation with speech and social problems. The common 
      features of human neurodevelopmental disorders caused by the loss or increase of 
      MeCP2 function suggest that even modest alterations of MeCP2 protein levels result 
      in neurodevelopmental problems. To determine whether a small reduction in MeCP2 
      level has phenotypic consequences, we characterized a conditional mouse allele of 
      Mecp2 that expresses 50% of the wild-type level of MeCP2. Upon careful behavioral 
      analysis, mice that harbor this allele display a spectrum of abnormalities such as 
      learning and motor deficits, decreased anxiety, altered social behavior and nest 
      building, decreased pain recognition and disrupted breathing patterns. These results 
      indicate that precise control of MeCP2 is critical for normal behavior and predict 
      that human neurodevelopmental disorders will result from a subtle reduction in MeCP2 
      expression.

TI  - Fragile XE-associated familial mental retardation protein 2 (FMR2) acts as a potent 
      transcription activator.
PG  - 251-9
AB  - Expansion of the FRAXE CCG repeat to a full mutation is associated with methylation 
      and transcriptional silencing of the FMR2 gene, and as a consequence, 
      mild-to-borderline mental retardation. FMR2 is a member of a family of four 
      proteins, AF4, LAF4, FMR2, and AF5q31. The proteins associated with this family 
      localize to the cell nucleus. Various regions of FMR2, and each of the other members 
      of the protein family, were cloned and analyzed for transcription activation in 
      yeast and mammalian cells. In both yeast and mammalian cells, FMR2 showed strong 
      transcription activation. AF4 activation potential was several-fold lower. 
      Interestingly, isoforms of both FMR2 and LAF4 lacking exon 3 activated transcription 
      better than the larger isoforms containing exon 3. Compared with the other members 
      of the family, activation by FMR2 was the strongest. Our results show that FMR2 is a 
      potent transcription activator and that its function is conserved. Elucidation of 
      the function of the FMR2 protein as a transcription activator may place FMR2 within 
      the molecular signalling pathways involved in nonspecific X-linked mental 
      retardation (MRX).

TI  - Primrose syndrome: Characterization of the phenotype in 42 patients.
PG  - 890-901
LID - 10.1111/cge.13749 [doi]
AB  - Primrose syndrome (PS; MIM# 259050) is characterized by intellectual disability 
      (ID), macrocephaly, unusual facial features (frontal bossing, deeply set eyes, 
      down-slanting palpebral fissures), calcified external ears, sparse body hair and 
      distal muscle wasting. The syndrome is caused by de novo heterozygous missense 
      variants in ZBTB20. Most of the 29 published patients are adults as characteristics 
      appear more recognizable with age. We present 13 hitherto unpublished individuals 
      and summarize the clinical and molecular findings in all 42 patients. Several signs 
      and symptoms of PS develop during childhood, but the cardinal features, such as 
      calcification of the external ears, cystic bone lesions, muscle wasting, and 
      contractures typically develop between 10 and 16 years of age. Biochemically, anemia 
      and increased alpha-fetoprotein levels are often present. Two adult males with PS 
      developed a testicular tumor. Although PS should be regarded as a progressive 
      entity, there are no indications that cognition becomes more impaired with age. No 
      obvious genotype-phenotype correlation is present. A subgroup of patients with 
      ZBTB20 variants may be associated with mild, nonspecific ID. Metabolic 
      investigations suggest a disturbed mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. We suggest a 
      regular surveillance in all adult males with PS until it is clear whether or not 
      there is a truly elevated risk of testicular cancer.

TI  - Human chromosome fragility.
PG  - 3-16
AB  - Fragile sites are heritable specific chromosome loci that exhibit an increased 
      frequency of gaps, poor staining, constrictions or breaks when chromosomes are 
      exposed to partial DNA replication inhibition. They constitute areas of chromatin 
      that fail to compact during mitosis. They are classified as rare or common depending 
      on their frequency within the population and are further subdivided on the basis of 
      their specific induction chemistry into different groups differentiated as folate 
      sensitive or non-folate sensitive rare fragile sites, and as aphidicolin, 
      bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) or 5-azacytidine inducible common fragile sites. Most of 
      the known inducers of fragility share in common their potentiality to inhibit the 
      elongation of DNA replication, particularly at fragile site loci. Seven folate 
      sensitive (FRA10A, FRA11B, FRA12A, FRA16A, FRAXA, FRAXE and FRAXF) and two 
      non-folate sensitive (FRA10B and FRA16B) fragile sites have been molecularly 
      characterized. All have been found to represent expanded DNA repeat sequences 
      resulting from a dynamic mutation involving the normally occurring polymorphic 
      CCG/CGG trinucleotide repeats at the folate sensitive and AT-rich minisatellite 
      repeats at the non-folate sensitive fragile sites. These expanded repeats were 
      demonstrated, first, to have the potential, under certain conditions, to form stable 
      secondary non-B DNA structures (intra-strand hairpins, slipped strand DNA or 
      tetrahelical structures) and to present highly flexible repeat sequences, both 
      conditions which are expected to affect the replication dynamics, and second, to 
      decrease the efficiency of nucleosome assembly, resulting in decondensation defects 
      seen as fragile sites. Thirteen aphidicolin inducible common fragile sites (FRA2G, 
      FRA3B, FRA4F, FRA6E, FRA6F, FRA7E, FRA7G, FRA7H, FRA7I, FRA8C, FRA9E, FRA16D and 
      FRAXB) have been characterized at a molecular level and found to represent 
      relatively AT-rich DNA areas, but without any expanded repeat motifs. Analysis of 
      structural characteristics of the DNA at some of these sites (FRA2G, FRA3B, FRA6F, 
      FRA7E, FRA7G, FRA7H, FRA7I, FRA16D and FRAXB) showed that they contained more areas 
      of high DNA torsional flexibility with more highly AT-dinucleotide-rich islands than 
      neighbouring non-fragile regions. These islands were shown to have the potential to 
      form secondary non-B DNA structures and to interfere with higher-order chromatin 
      folding. Therefore, a common fragility mechanism, characterized by high flexibility 
      and the potential to form secondary structures and interfere with nucleosome 
      assembly, is shared by all the cloned classes of fragile sites. From the clinical 
      point of view, the folate sensitive rare fragile site FRAXA is the most important 
      fragile site as it is associated with the fragile X syndrome, the most common form 
      of familial mental retardation, affecting about 1/4000 males and 1/6000 females. 
      Mental retardation in this syndrome is considered as resulting from the abolition of 
      the FMR1 gene expression due to hypermethylation of the gene CpG islands adjacent to 
      the expanded methylated trinucleotide repeat. FRAXE is associated with X-linked 
      non-specific mental retardation, and FRA11B with Jacobsen syndrome. There is also 
      some evidence that fragile sites, especially common fragile sites, are consistently 
      involved in the in vivo chromosomal rearrangements related to cancer, whereas the 
      possible implication of common fragile sites in neuropsychiatric and developmental 
      disorders is still poorly documented.

TI  - The c.429_452 duplication of the ARX gene: a unique developmental-model of limb 
      kinetic apraxia.
PG  - 25
LID - 10.1186/1750-1172-9-25 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The c.429_452dup24 of the ARX gene is a rare genetic anomaly, leading to 
      X-Linked Intellectual Disability without brain malformation. While in certain cases 
      c.429_452dup24 has been associated with specific clinical patterns such as 
      Partington syndrome, the consequence of this mutation has been also often classified 
      as "non-specific Intellectual Disability". The present work aims at a more precise 
      description of the clinical features linked to the c.429_452dup24 mutation. METHODS: 
      We clinically reviewed all affected patients identified in France over a five-year 
      period, i.e. 27 patients from 12 different families. Detailed cognitive, 
      behavioural, and motor evaluation, as well as standardized videotaped assessments of 
      oro-lingual and gestural praxis, were performed. In a sub-group of 13 ARX patients, 
      kinematic and MRI studies were further accomplished to better characterize the motor 
      impairment prevalent in the ARX patients group. To ensure that data were specific to 
      the ARX gene mutation and did not result from low-cognitive functioning per se, a 
      group of 27 age- and IQ-matched Down syndrome patients served as control. RESULTS: 
      Neuropsychological and motor assessment indicated that the c.429_452dup24 mutation 
      constitutes a recognizable clinical syndrome: ARX patients exhibiting Intellectual 
      Disability, without primary motor impairment, but with a very specific upper limb 
      distal motor apraxia associated with a pathognomonic hand-grip. Patients affected 
      with the so-called Partington syndrome, which involves major hand dystonia and 
      orolingual apraxia, exhibit the most severe symptoms of the disorder. The particular 
      "reach and grip" impairment which was observed in all ARX patients, but not in Down 
      syndrome patients, was further characterized by the kinematic data: (i) loss of 
      preference for the index finger when gripping an object, (ii) major impairment of 
      fourth finger deftness, and (iii) a lack of pronation movements. This lack of distal 
      movement coordination exhibited by ARX patients is associated with the loss of 
      independent digital dexterity and is similar to the distortion of individual finger 
      movements and posture observed in Limb Kinetic Apraxia. CONCLUSION: These findings 
      suggest that the ARX c.429_452dup24 mutation may be a developmental model for Limb 
      Kinetic Apraxia.

TI  - The changing purpose of Prader-Willi syndrome clinical diagnostic criteria and 
      proposed revised criteria.
PG  - E92
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a complex, multisystem disorder. Its 
      major clinical features include neonatal hypotonia, developmental delay, short 
      stature, behavioral abnormalities, childhood-onset obesity, hypothalamic 
      hypogonadism, and characteristic appearance. The genetic basis of PWS is also 
      complex. It is caused by absence of expression of the paternally active genes in the 
      PWS critical region on 15q11-q13. In approximately 70% of cases this is the result 
      of deletion of this region from the paternal chromosome 15. In approximately 28%, it 
      is attributable to maternal uniparental disomy (UPD; inheritance of 2 copies of a 
      chromosome from the mother and no copies from the father, as opposed to the normal 1 
      copy from each parent) of chromosome 15, and in <2%, it is the result of a mutation, 
      deletion, or other defect in the imprinting center. Clinical diagnostic criteria 
      were established by consensus in 1993. Subsequently, definitive molecular genetic 
      testing became available for laboratory diagnosis of PWS. However, identification of 
      appropriate patients for testing remains a challenge for most practitioners because 
      many features of the disorder are nonspecific and others can be subtle or evolve 
      over time. For example, hypotonic infants who are still in the failure to thrive 
      phase of the disorder often do not have sufficient features for recognition of PWS 
      and often are not tested. Initial screening with these diagnostic criteria can 
      increase the yield of molecular testing for older children and adults with 
      nonspecific obesity and mental retardation. Therefore, the purpose of clinical 
      diagnostic criteria has shifted from assisting in making the definitive diagnosis to 
      raising diagnostic suspicion, thereby prompting testing. We conducted a 
      retrospective review of patients with PWS confirmed with genetic testing to assess 
      the validity and sensitivity of clinical diagnostic criteria published before the 
      widespread availability of testing for all affected patients and recommend revised 
      clinical criteria. METHODS: Charts of all 90 patients with laboratory-confirmed PWS 
      were reviewed. For each patient, the presence or absence of the major, minor, and 
      supportive features listed in the published diagnostic criteria was recorded. The 
      sensitivity of each criterion, mean of the total number of major and minor criteria, 
      and mean total score for each patient were calculated. RESULTS: There were 68 
      patients with a deletion (del 15q11-q13), 21 with maternal UPD of chromosome 15, and 
      1 with a presumed imprinting defect. Age range at the time of the most recent 
      evaluation was 5 months to 60 years (median: 14.5 years; del median: 14 years; 
      range: 5 months-60 years; UPD median: 18 years; range: 5-42 years). The 
      sensitivities of the major criteria ranged from 49% (characteristic facial features) 
      to 98% (developmental delay). Global developmental delay and neonatal hypotonia were 
      the 2 most consistently positive major criteria and were positive in >97% of the 
      patients. Feeding problems in infancy, excessive weight gain after 1 year, 
      hypogonadism, and hyperphagia were all present in 93% or more of patients. 
      Sensitivities of the minor criteria ranged form 37% (sleep disturbance and apneas) 
      to 93% (speech and articulation defects). Interestingly, the sensitivities of 8 of 
      the minor criteria were higher than the sensitivity of characteristic facial 
      features, which is a major criterion. Fifteen out of 90 patients with molecular 
      diagnosis did not meet the clinical diagnostic criteria retrospectively. CONCLUSION: 
      When definitive diagnostic testing is not available, as was the case for PWS when 
      the 1993 criteria were developed, diagnostic criteria are important to avoid 
      overdiagnosis and to ensure that diagnostic test development is performed on 
      appropriate samples. When diagnostic testing is available, as is now the case for 
      PWS, diagnostic criteria should serve to raise diagnostic suspicion, ensure that all 
      appropriate people are tested, and avoid the expense of testing unnecessarily. Our 
      results indicate that the sensitivities of most of the published criteria are 
      acceptable. However, 16.7% of patients with molecular diagnosis did not meet the 
      1993 clinical diagnostic criteria retrospectively, suggesting that the published 
      criteria may be too exclusive. A less strict scoring system may ensure that all 
      appropriate people are tested. Accordingly, we suggest revised clinical criteria to 
      help identify the appropriate patients for DNA testing for PWS. The suggested age 
      groupings are based on characteristic phases of the natural history of PWS. Some of 
      the features (eg, neonatal hypotonia, feeding problems in infancy) serve to diagnose 
      the syndrome in the first few years of life, whereas others (eg, excessive eating) 
      are useful during early childhood. Similarly, hypogonadism is most useful during and 
      after adolescence. Some of the features like neonatal hypotonia and infantile 
      feeding problems are less likely to be missed, whereas others such as characteristic 
      facial features and hypogonadism (especially in prepubertal females) may require 
      more careful and/or expert examination. The issue of who should have diagnostic 
      testing is distinct from the determination of features among confirmed patients. 
      Based on the sensitivities of the published criteria and our experience, we suggest 
      testing all newborns/infants with otherwise unexplained hypotonia with poor suck. 
      For children between 2 and 6 years of age, we consider hypotonia with history of 
      poor suck associated with global developmental delay sufficient criteria to prompt 
      testing. Between 6 and 12 years of age, we suggest testing those with hypotonia (or 
      history of hypotonia with poor suck), global developmental delay, and excessive 
      eating with central obesity (if uncontrolled). At the ages of 13 years and above, we 
      recommend testing patients with cognitive impairment, excessive eating with central 
      obesity (if uncontrolled), and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and/or typical behavior 
      problems (including temper tantrums and obsessive-compulsive features). Thus, we 
      propose a lower threshold to prompt diagnostic DNA testing, leading to a higher 
      likelihood of diagnosis of this disorder in which anticipatory guidance and 
      intervention can significantly influence outcome.

TI  - 20 ans après: a second mutation in MAOA identified by targeted high-throughput 
      sequencing in a family with altered behavior and cognition.
PG  - 776-83
LID - 10.1038/ejhg.2013.243 [doi]
AB  - Intellectual disability (ID) is characterized by an extraordinary genetic 
      heterogeneity, with >250 genes that have been implicated in monogenic forms of ID. 
      Because this complexity precluded systematic testing for mutations and because 
      clinical features are often non-specific, for some of these genes only few cases or 
      families have been unambiguously documented. It is the case of the X-linked gene 
      encoding monoamine oxidase A (MAOA), for which only one nonsense mutation has been 
      identified in Brunner syndrome, characterized in a single family by mild 
      non-dysmorphic ID and impulsive, violent and aggressive behaviors. We have performed 
      targeted high-throughput sequencing of 220 genes, including MAOA, in patients with 
      undiagnosed ID. We identified a c.797_798delinsTT (p.C266F) missense mutation in 
      MAOA in a boy with autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit and autoaggressive 
      behavior. Two maternal uncles carry the mutation and have severe ID, with a history 
      of maltreatment in early childhood. This novel missense mutation decreases MAOA 
      enzymatic activity, leading to abnormal levels of urinary monoamines. The 
      identification of this new point mutation confirms, for the first time since 1993, 
      the monogenic implication of the MAOA gene in ID of various degrees, autism and 
      behavioral disturbances. The variable expressivity of the mutation observed in male 
      patients of this family may involve gene-environment interactions, and the 
      identification of a perturbation in monoamine metabolism should be taken into 
      account when prescribing psychoactive drugs in such patients.

TI  - A Novel De Novo Frameshift Mutation in KAT6A Identified by Whole Exome Sequencing.
PG  - 10-14
LID - 10.1055/s-0038-1676649 [doi]
AB  - Intellectual disability is a common condition with multiple etiologies. The number 
      of monogenic causes has increased steadily in recent years due to the implementation 
      of next generation sequencing. Here, we describe a 2-year-old boy with global 
      developmental delay and intellectual disability. The child had feeding difficulties 
      since birth. He had delayed motor skills and muscular hypotonia. Brain magnetic 
      resonance imaging revealed diffuse white matter loss and thinning of the corpus 
      callosum. Banded karyotype and comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) array were 
      normal. Whole exome sequencing revealed a novel de novo frameshift mutation 
      c.3390delA (p.Lys1130Asnfs*4) in KAT6A gene (NM_006766.4). The heterozygous mutation 
      was confirmed by Sanger sequencing in the patient and its absence in his parents. 
      KAT6A that encodes a histone acetyltransferase has been recently found to be 
      associated with a neurodevelopmental disorder autosomal dominant mental retardation 
      32 (OMIM: no. 616268). Features of this disorder are nonspecific, which makes it 
      difficult to characterize the condition based on the clinical symptoms alone. 
      Therefore, our findings confirm the utility of whole exome sequencing to quickly and 
      reliably identify the etiology of such conditions.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Adults with Down syndrome are genetically predisposed to develop 
      Alzheimer's disease and accumulate beta-amyloid plaques (Aβ) early in life. While Aβ 
      has been heavily studied in Down syndrome, its relationship with neurofibrillary tau 
      is less understood. The aim of this study was to evaluate neurofibrillary tau 
      deposition in individuals with Down syndrome with varying levels of Aβ burden. 
      METHODS: A total of 161 adults with Down syndrome (mean age = 39.2 (8.50) years) and 
      40 healthy, non-Down syndrome sibling controls (43.2 (12.6) years) underwent 
      T1w-MRI, [C-11]PiB and [F-18]AV-1451 PET scans. PET images were converted to units 
      of standardized uptake value ratios (SUVrs). Aβ burden was calculated using the 
      amyloid load metric (Aβ(L)); a measure of global Aβ burden that improves 
      quantification from SUVrs by suppressing the nonspecific binding signal component 
      and computing the specific Aβ signal from all Aβ-carrying voxels from the image. 
      Regional tau was assessed using control-standardized AV-1451 SUVr. 
      Control-standardized SUVrs were compared across Down syndrome groups of Aβ-negative 
      (A-) (Aβ(L) < 13.3), subthreshold A+ (13.3 ≤ Aβ(L) < 20) and conventionally A+ 
      (Aβ(L) ≥ 20) individuals. The subthreshold A + group was identified as having 
      significantly higher Aβ burden compared to the A- group, but not high enough to 
      satisfy a conventional A + classification. RESULTS: A large-sized association that 
      survived adjustment for chronological age, mental age (assessed using the Peabody 
      Picture Vocabulary Test), and imaging site was observed between Aβ(L) and AV-1451 
      within each Braak region (p < .05). The A + group showed significantly higher 
      AV-1451 retention across all Braak regions compared to the A- and subthreshold 
      A + groups (p < .05). The subthreshold A + group showed significantly higher AV-1451 
      retention in Braak regions I-III compared to an age-matched sample from the A- group 
      (p < .05). DISCUSSION: These results show that even the earliest detectable Aβ 
      accumulation in Down syndrome is accompanied by elevated tau in the early Braak 
      stage regions. This early detection of tau can help characterize the tau 
      accumulation phase during preclinical Alzheimer's disease progression in Down 
      syndrome and suggests that there may be a relatively narrow window after Aβ 
      accumulation begins to prevent the downstream cascade of events that leads to 
      Alzheimer's disease.

PG  - 232-5
AB  - X-linked lissencephaly with abnormal genitalia (XLAG) is a distinct form of 
      lissencephaly associated with absent corpus callosum. Recently, forms of syndromic 
      and nonspecific X-linked mental retardation have been found to be associated with 
      mutations in the Aristaless-related homeobox gene ARX. The authors assessed ARX as a 
      candidate gene for XLAG in a genetic analysis of neuronal migration disorders and 
      found two different point mutations in two XLAG pedigrees affecting the homeodomain 
      of the protein, confirming that ARX is a causative gene for XLAG.

TI  - Clinical and genetic analysis for four Chinese families with Prader-Willi syndrome.
PG  - 37-44
LID - 10.1007/s12020-009-9203-1 [doi]
AB  - Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a complex, genetic, multisystem disorder. Its major 
      clinical features include neonatal hypotonia and failure to thrive, mental 
      retardation, hypogonadism, short hands and feet, hyperphagia-caused obesity, and 
      characteristic appearance. The genetic basis of PWS is also complex. It is caused by 
      the absence of expression of the active paternal genes such as the SNRPN, NDN, and 
      possibly others in the PWS critical region on 15q11-13. PWS is in effect a 
      contiguous gene syndrome resulting from deletion of the paternal copies of the 
      imprinted. Consensus in clinical diagnostic criteria was established in 1993. 
      However, identifying relevant patients for tests remains a challenge for most 
      practitioners, as many features of the disorder are nonspecific, and others can be 
      subtle or evolved over time. Consequently, molecular genetic tests can be used to 
      diagnose PWS accurately, allowing early diagnosis of the syndrome. High resolution 
      G-banding, high resolution cytogenetic methylation-specific PCR (MS-PCR), and 
      fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) are routinely used to diagnose PWS. In 
      this study, four Chinese patients, with typical PWS features, were detected by 
      MS-PCR and FISH. Three were cytogenetically normal, but lacked paternal expression 
      of proximal chromosome 15q because of maternal uniparental disomy (UPD). The other 
      one, however, demonstrated an unbalanced de novo translocation 46, XX, t (7; 15).

TI  - Risk stratification and consecutive prognosis progresses in childhood Wilms tumors. 
      Two cases report.
PG  - 106-11
LID - 20 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Even if Wilms' tumour is the commonest primary malignant neoplasia in 
      children, it maintained a continuous interest due to actual therapeutic successes 
      contrasting with the customary delayed diagnosis, malignancy and specific risk 
      factors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two recent illustrative cases from our clinic are 
      presented. The first one - a little girl of 22 months with repeated admissions for 
      habitual constipation and psychomental disturbances revealed at abdominal 
      ultrasonography a hypo-echoic mass at the superior pole of the right kidney. CT 
      confirmed the presence of a solid homogeneous mass of 23/25 mm without node or 
      distant metastases, suggestive for Wilms' tumour. Conforming to SIOP protocol she 
      received chemotherapy and after 4 weeks a superior polar nephrectomy was performed. 
      Pathology confirmed the diagnosis of triphasic nephroblastoma of intermediary risk. 
      Postoperative chemotherapy according to the protocol SIOP assured the cure with a 
      disease free period of 23 months. The second case - also a girl, of 3 years, is 
      admitted for constipation, pain in the left flank and mental retard (QI=40). 
      Ultrasonography determined a huge mass (Ø~6 cm) situated at the superior pole of the 
      left kidney. CT attested a nonhomogeneous, encapsulated tumour image of 6.2/5.4/7.2 
      cm in large posterolateral contact with the renal parenchyma out of which it appears 
      to be developed. The diagnosis of WT is strongly suggested and after chemotherapy a 
      radical left nephrectomy with initial vessels ligature was performed. Pathology: 
      stage IIb nephroblastoma with focal epithelial anaplasia. After surgery she 
      continued the chemotherapy (HR regime), was cured and excepting a medullar aplasia 
      is in a good health after 24 months. DISCUSSIONS: Our both cases were girls under 3 
      years, presenting nonspecific features: constipation and psychic troubles, the 
      tumour being incidentally discovered by the abdominal ultrasonography. CT 
      established the diagnosis. Conventional chemotherapy framing adapted to the tumour's 
      stage and surgery conducted to a stable cure of about two years in both cases. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Conforming to the SIOP protocols preoperative chemotherapy was 
      applicable, well-tolerated and efficacious for two recent cases presented in our 
      clinic, determining the shrinkage of tumour volume and stage and consecutive 
      reduction of the surgical risks.

TI  - Holoprosencephaly in a Down syndrome child.
PG  - 201-6
AB  - Gross malformation of the central nervous system (CNS) is rare in Down syndrome 
      (DS). To our knowledge we report for the first time the association of trisomy 21 
      and holoprosencephaly. Because of the low probability of chance concurrence due to 
      unrelated causes, a causal relationship between these two conditions in the patient 
      must be presumed. The anatomic similarity of the holoprosencephalic defect in this 
      infant to that seen in others with autosomal dominant, recessive, sporadic, or 
      syndromal forms of holoprosencephaly, supports the hypothesis that: a) this CNS 
      defect is a causally nonspecific developmental field complex (DFC); b) the increased 
      incidence of such DFC's in the DS represents the result of a nonspecific decrease of 
      developmental homeostasis [Waddington, 1975] due to autosomal aneuploidy.

TI  - The "gene dosage effect" hypothesis versus the "amplified developmental instability" 
      hypothesis in Down syndrome.
PG  - 293-303
AB  - Two hypotheses exist to explain the Down syndrome (DS) phenotype. The "gene dosage 
      effect" hypothesis states that the phenotype is a direct result of the cumulative 
      effect of the imbalance of the individual genes located on the triplicated 
      chromosome or chromosome region. In a nut shell, the phenotype results directly from 
      the overexpression of specific chromosome 21 genes. The "amplified developmental 
      instability" hypothesis contends that most manifestations of DS may be interpreted 
      as the results of a non-specific disturbance of chromosome balance, resulting in a 
      disruption of homeostasis. This hypothesis was proposed in an attempt to explain the 
      similarities between the phenotypes of different aneuploid states and the 
      observation that all of the phenotypic traits in DS are also seen in the general 
      population but at lower frequency, with less severity and usually only present as a 
      single trait. Herein, we review recent data and present evidence to support the 
      theory that the phenotypic traits of aneuploid syndromes, and DS in particular, 
      result from the increased dosage of genes encoded on the triplicated chromosome.

TI  - Antenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome: how good is state of the art.
PG  - 36, 38-40
AB  - A newborn with Down syndrome can be expected once in a thousand deliveries. 
      Amniocentesis for karyotyping of foetal cells or detection of foetal cell in the 
      maternal circulation ie, fluorescent in-situ hybridisation (FISH) and karyotyping, 
      are definitive methods of making the diagnosis antenatally. The cost of doing this 
      routinely in all pregnancies is prohibitive. This has led to dependence on screening 
      tests, to select women more likely to be carrying a Down foetus, to offer 
      karyotyping in a more cost efficient manner. Unfortunately, these screening 
      criteria, namely maternal age, biochemical markers and ultrasound pointers, are 
      rather insensitive and miss a large number of cases of Down syndrome. At the same 
      time they are very non-specific, picking up a large number of false positive cases, 
      resulting in undue anxiety and unnecessary alarm in a large number of mothers. Till 
      a non-invasive, definitive test, like FISH can be routinely used in all pregnancies 
      at affordable costs, accurate antenatal diagnosis on a community basis will be a hit 
      and miss affair.

TI  - Continuous, generalized, high-voltage fast activity and FIRDA in two children.
PG  - 68-71
AB  - The EEG pattern of continuous, generalized, high-voltage fast rhythms without any 
      reaction to eye-opening/closure, photic stimulation, or the sleep-awaking cycle was 
      previously reported to be characteristic of infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy (INAD). 
      However, we have observed such fast activity in one child with INAD and one with 
      Menkes' kinky-hair syndrome. They both exhibited severe psychomotor disturbance, and 
      their EEGs also included "frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity (FIRDA)," a 
      nonspecific EEG finding suggestive of organic encephalopathy. Since the continuous, 
      generalized, high-voltage fast activity had features suggestive of spindles in both 
      children, this EEG pattern is thought to actually represent "extreme spindles," and 
      nonspecifically to indicate widespread organic brain damage.

TI  - Intervention in the context of development: pathways toward new treatments.
PG  - 225-37
LID - 10.1038/npp.2014.232 [doi]
AB  - Neuropsychiatric disorders vary substantially in age of onset but are best 
      understood within the context of neurodevelopment. Here, we review opportunities for 
      intervention at critical points in developmental trajectories. We begin by 
      discussing potential opportunities to prevent neuropsychiatric disorders. Once 
      symptoms begin to emerge, a number of interventions have been studied either before 
      a diagnosis can be made or shortly after diagnosis. Although some of these 
      interventions are helpful, few are based upon an understanding of pathophysiology, 
      and most ameliorate rather than resolve symptoms. As such, in the next portion of 
      the review, we turn our discussion to genetic syndromes that are rare phenocopies of 
      common diagnoses such as autism spectrum disorder or schizophrenia. Cellular or 
      animal models of these syndromes point to specific regulatory or signaling pathways. 
      As examples, findings from the mouse models of Fragile X and Rett syndromes point to 
      potential treatments now being tested in randomized clinical trials. Paralleling 
      oncology, we can hope that our treatments will move from nonspecific, like 
      chemotherapies thrown at a wide range of tumor types, to specific, like the protein 
      kinase inhibitors that target molecularly defined tumors. Some of these targeted 
      treatments later show benefit for a broader, yet specific, array of cancers. We can 
      hope that medications developed within rare neurodevelopmental syndromes will 
      similarly help subgroups of patients with disruptions in overlapping signaling 
      pathways. The insights gleaned from treatment development in rare phenocopy 
      syndromes may also teach us how to test treatments based upon emerging common 
      genetic or environmental risk factors.

TI  - Monosomy 18p.
PG  - 4
LID - 10.1186/1750-1172-3-4 [doi]
AB  - Monosomy 18p refers to a chromosomal disorder resulting from the deletion of all or 
      part of the short arm of chromosome 18. The incidence is estimated to be about 
      1:50,000 live-born infants. In the commonest form of the disorder, the dysmorphic 
      syndrome is very moderate and non-specific. The main clinical features are short 
      stature, round face with short philtrum, palpebral ptosis and large ears with 
      detached pinnae. Intellectual deficiency is mild to moderate. A small subset of 
      patients, about 10-15 percent of cases, present with severe brain/facial 
      malformations evocative of holoprosencephaly spectrum disorders. In two-thirds of 
      the cases, the 18p- syndrome is due to a mere terminal deletion occurring de novo, 
      in one-third the following are possible: a de novo translocation with loss of 18p, 
      malsegregation of a parental translocation or inversion, or a ring chr18. Parental 
      transmission of the 18p- syndrome has been reported. Cytogenetic analysis is 
      necessary to make a definite diagnosis. Recurrence risk for siblings is low in de 
      novo deletions and translocations, but is significant if a parental rearrangement is 
      present. Deletion 18p can be detected prenatally by amniocentesis or chorionic 
      villus sampling and cytogenetic testing. Differential diagnosis may include a wide 
      number of syndromes with short stature and mild intellectual deficiency. In young 
      children, deletion 18p syndrome may be vaguely evocative of either Turner syndrome 
      or trisomy 21. No specific treatment exists but speech therapy and early educational 
      programs may help to improve the performances of the children. Except for the 
      patients with severe brain malformations, the life expectancy does not seem 
      significantly reduced.

TI  - FMR2 expression in families with FRAXE mental retardation.
PG  - 435-41
AB  - Normal individuals express the two alternative transcripts, FMR2 and Ox19, from the 
      FRAXE-associated CpG island. Molecular analysis of the Ox19 transcript suggests that 
      it is a truncated isoform of the FMR2 gene with an alternative 3' end. Both isoforms 
      showed a similar pattern of expression, with the Ox19 isoform expressed at a much 
      lower level. Fibroblasts, chorionic villi and hair roots showed the highest level of 
      FMR2 expression, whole blood cells and amniocytes showed very low expression, and 
      the transcript was not detected in lymphoblasts. Fibroblasts of 11 individuals from 
      seven families segregating FRAXE were assayed for FMR2 expression and FRAXE CpG 
      island methylation. A man with an unmethylated expansion of 0.6 kb expressed FMR2 
      and represents a pre-mutation carrier. All chromosomes with FRAXE CCG expansions of 
      0.8 kb or greater were fully methylated and did not express the FMR2 gene, analogous 
      to the mechanism of silencing the FMR1 gene in carriers of the FRAXA full mutation. 
      The boundary between FRAXE pre-mutation and FRAXE full mutation is between 0.7 and 
      0.8 kb. Two men with absence of FMR2 expression in fibroblasts were not mentally 
      impaired, suggesting that IQ in some men with FRAXE full mutation may remain within 
      the normal range. Although molecular tools to study FRAXE non-specific mental 
      retardation are now available, further psychometric and molecular studies are needed 
      to characterize the effect of the FRAXE full mutation for the purpose of genetic 
      counselling.

TI  - Too much of a good thing: mechanisms of gene action in Down syndrome.
PG  - 83-8
AB  - The molecular mechanisms underlying the specific traits in individuals with Down 
      syndrome (DS) have been postulated to derive either from nonspecific perturbation of 
      balanced genetic programs, or from the simple, mendelian-like influence of a small 
      subset of genes on chromosome 21. However, these models do not provide a 
      comprehensive explanation for experimental or clinical observations of the effects 
      of trisomy 21. DS is best viewed as a complex genetic disorder, where the specific 
      phenotypic manifestations in a given individual are products of genetic, 
      environmental and stochastic influences. Mouse models that recapitulate both the 
      genetic basis for and the phenotypic consequences of trisomy provide an experimental 
      system to define these contributions.

TI  - Emotional responsivity in young children with Williams syndrome.
PG  - 194-206
AB  - The hypothesis that young children with Williams syndrome show higher rates of 
      emotional responsivity relative to other children with developmental disabilities 
      was explored. Performance of 23 young children with Williams syndrome and 30 
      MA-matched children with developmental disabilities of nonspecific etiologies was 
      compared on an adaptation of Repacholi and Gopnik's (1997) "Yummy-Yucky" task. 
      Results show that children with Williams syndrome were more likely to mimic and/or 
      imitate facial affect and vocalizations than children in the mixed comparison group. 
      Yet, this increased emotional responsivity did not substantially improve 
      decision-making based on the affective display; children with Williams syndrome were 
      more likely to attempt to convince the experimenter that the disliked food was 
      likable. Implications of a social profile that includes enhanced emotional 
      responsivity paired with impaired perspective taking are discussed.

AB  - Radioligand assays have been developed for the principal reproductive steroids and 
      peptide hormones. Specific binding reagents have included antibodies, plasma 
      binders, and intracellular receptors. In each assay, problems of specificity,

      endocrine physiology in childhood, during puberty, and in adulthood have been 
      characterized. Hormonal evaluations of endocrine disorders of reproduction are 
      characterized on the basis of their characteristic pathophysiologic alterations.

AB  - A study of the immunoglobulin level in the 3 main classes (IgG, IgM and IgA) and 
      lysozymes in the blood serum of 73 patients with Down's disease (from 5 to 20 years 
      of age) showed an increase of IgG in the younger age (up to 7 years) and older 
      groups (over 7 years). The content of IgM was significantly lower in the younger 
      group and did not differ from the control indices in the older group. The level of 
      IgA corresponded to normal indices. The studies demonstrated a marked drop in the 
      lysozyme content. The role of the abnormal system of humoral immunity and reactions 
      of nonspecific defense in the formation of predisposition to the development of 
      infectious diseases in this form of pathology is discussed.

AB  - Impaired sustained attention is considered an important factor in determining poor 
      functional outcomes across multiple cognitive and behavioural disorders. Sustained 
      attention is compromised for both children with Williams syndrome (WS) and Down's 
      syndrome (DS), but specific difficulties remain poorly understood because of 
      limitations in how sustained attention has been assessed thus far. In the current 
      study, we compared the performance of typically developing children (N = 99), 
      children with WS (N = 25), and children with DS (N = 18), on a Continuous 
      Performance Task - a standard tool for measuring sustained attention. In contrast to 
      previous studies, primarily focused on overall differences in mean performance, we 
      estimated the extent to which performance changed over time on task, thus focusing 
      directly on the sustained element of performance. Children with WS and children with 
      DS performed more poorly overall compared to typically developing children. 
      Importantly, measures specific to changes over time differentiated between children 
      with the two syndromes. Children with WS showed a decrement in performance, whereas 
      children with Down's syndrome demonstrated non-specific poor performance. In 
      addition, our measure of change in performance predicted teacher-rated attention 
      deficits symptoms across the full sample. An approach that captures dynamic changes 
      in performance over assessments may be fruitful for investigating similarities and 
      differences in sustained attention for other atypically developing populations.

TI  - Alzheimer's disease in people with Down's syndrome: the prospects for and the 
      challenges of developing preventative treatments.
PG  - 804-813
LID - 10.1007/s00415-016-8308-8 [doi]
AB  - People with Down's syndrome (DS) are at high risk for developing Alzheimer's disease 
      (AD) at a relatively young age. This increased risk is not observed in people with 
      intellectual disabilities for reasons other than DS and for this reason it is 
      unlikely to be due to non-specific effects of having a neurodevelopmental disorder 
      but, instead, a direct consequence of the genetics of DS (trisomy 21). Given the 
      location of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene on chromosome 21, the amyloid 
      cascade hypothesis is the dominant theory accounting for this risk, with other 
      genetic and environmental factors modifying the age of onset and the course of the 
      disease. Several potential therapies targeting the amyloid pathway and aiming to 
      modify the course of AD are currently being investigated, which may also be useful 
      for treating AD in DS. However, given that the neuropathology associated with AD 
      starts many years before dementia manifests, any preventative treatment must start 
      well before the onset of symptoms. To enable trials of such interventions, plasma, 
      CSF, brain, and retinal biomarkers are being studied as proxy early diagnostic and 
      outcome measures for AD. In this systematic review, we consider the prospects for 
      the development of potential preventative treatments of AD in the DS population and 
      their evaluation.

TI  - Interstitial duplications of chromosome region 15q11q13: clinical and molecular 
      characterization.
PG  - 82-9
AB  - Duplications of chromosome region 15q11q13 often occur as a supernumerary chromosome 
      15. Less frequently they occur as interstitial duplications [dup(15)]. We describe 
      the clinical and molecular characteristics of three patients with de novo dup(15). 
      The patients, two males and one female (ages 3-21 years), had nonspecific findings 
      that included autistic behavior, hypotonia, and variable degrees of mental 
      retardation. The extent, orientation, and parental origin of the duplications were 
      assessed by fluorescent in situ hybridization, microsatellite analyses, and 
      methylation status at D15S63. Two patients had large direct duplications of 15q11q13 
      [dir dup(15)(q11q13)] that extended through the entire Angelman 
      syndrome/Prader-Willi syndrome (AS/PWS) chromosomal region. Their proximal and 
      distal breaks, at D15S541 or D15S9 and between D15S12 and D15S24, respectively, were 
      comparable to those found in the common AS/PWS deletions. This suggests that 
      duplications and deletions may be the reciprocal product of an unequal recombination 
      event. These two duplications were maternally derived, but the origin of the 
      chromatids involved in the unequal crossing over in meiosis differs. In one patient, 
      the duplication originated from two different maternal chromosomes, while in the 
      other patient it arose from the same maternal chromosome. The third patient had a 
      much smaller duplication that involved only D15S11 and parental origin could not be 
      determined. There was no obvious correlation between phenotype and extent of the 
      duplication in these patients.

TI  - Do children with Williams syndrome really have good vocabulary knowledge? Methods 
      for comparing cognitive and linguistic abilities in developmental disorders.
PG  - 673-88
AB  - The comparison of cognitive and linguistic skills in individuals with developmental 
      disorders is fraught with methodological and psychometric difficulties. In this 
      paper, we illustrate some of these issues by comparing the receptive vocabulary 
      knowledge and non-verbal reasoning abilities of 41 children with Williams syndrome, 
      a genetic disorder in which language abilities are often claimed to be relatively 
      strong. Data from this group were compared with data from typically developing 
      children, children with Down syndrome, and children with non-specific learning 
      difficulties using a number of approaches including comparison of age-equivalent 
      scores, matching, analysis of covariance, and regression-based standardization. 
      Across these analyses children with Williams syndrome consistently demonstrated 
      relatively good receptive vocabulary knowledge, although this effect appeared 
      strongest in the oldest children.

LID - 10.1016/j.appet.2009.12.002 [doi]
AB  - This study focused on genetic and behavioural aspects of one important component of 
      the motivation to eat - how appetitive arousal is elicited through the presentation 
      of food-associated stimuli. Individuals with Prader-Willi syndrome, a genetic 
      disorder associated with hyperphagia, and control participants completed a 
      computerised response task in the presence of motivational stimuli. In controls, 
      appetitive arousal was specific to particular stimuli. In contrast, individuals with 
      PWS showed a non-specific pattern of arousal. Over-activation of the anticipatory 
      motivation system may be one consequence of the genetic disorder in PWS.

TI  - [Ultrasound markers for Down syndrome].
PG  - 37-42
AB  - Trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) is the most common chromosomal abnormality. Sonographic 
      findings in fetuses with Down syndrome include both structural abnormalities and 
      nonstructural abnormalities or "markers." These markers are known as "soft markers" 
      of aneuploidy. These markers are nonspecific, often transient. The most commonly 
      studied soft markers of aneuploidy include a thickened nuchal fold, long bones 
      shortening, mild fetal pyelectasis, echogenic bowel, echogenic intracardiac focus, 
      FMF angle > 90 degrees, pathologic velocity of Ductus venosus and choroid plexus 
      cyst.

TI  - Nonspecific mitochondrial disease with epilepsy in children: diagnostic approaches 
      and epileptic phenotypes.
PG  - 1301-7
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study sought to characterize epileptic phenotypes in children with 
      nonspecific mitochondrial disease (MD) and to evaluate MD diagnostic approaches. 
      METHODS: A retrospective analysis of the medical, electroencephalogram, and 
      laboratory records of 142 patients with epilepsy was performed. The patients were 
      evaluated for MD, and 124 patients were included in the final cohort. The MD 
      criteria used included an oral glucose lactate stimulation test (OGLST) and urine 
      organic acid/plasma amino acid (UOA/PAA) assays as metabolic indicators of modified 
      Walker criteria, as suggested by Bernier et al. (Neurology 59:1406-1411, 2002). 
      RESULTS: Twenty-two patients were classified as having definite MD (9), probable MD 
      (5), possible MD (6), or pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) deficiency (3), including one 
      patient which showed a respiratory chain (RC) defect and PDH deficiency. Seven out 
      of eight patients in whom significant RC defects were observed showed complex I 
      defects. In 14 patients, epileptic seizures start at infantile ages. Of 17 patients 
      who substantially presented generalized seizures, 4 patients started with partial 
      seizures. Five patients consistently presented only partial seizures. The OGLST and 
      UOA/PAA assays were useful for a more precise diagnosis of MD, although low positive 
      predictive value of the OGLST was regrettable. No patient was classified as definite 
      MD by Walker's original criteria, but the use of our revised MD criteria resulted in 
      the classification of nine additional patients as definite MD. CONCLUSIONS: MD 
      manifested considerable diverse epileptic phenotypes and should be considered in the 
      differential diagnosis of epilepsy in children with unexplained encephalomyopathy 
      and progressive and fluctuating clinical courses.

TI  - Is there an inverse relationship between Down's syndrome and bipolar affective 
      disorder? Literature review and genetic implications.
PG  - 613-20
AB  - Several authors have suggested the existence of an inverse relationship between 
      bipolar affective disorder and Down's syndrome (DS). The present authors have 
      examined this hypothesis by a critical review of the literature. The present 
      findings are consistent with a reduced rate of bipolar disorder in subjects with DS 
      when compared with non-DS mentally retarded adults and with the general population. 
      Thus, possession of an extra copy of chromosome 21 may confer protection against 
      bipolar disorder. This could be the result of non-specific mechanisms or the action 
      of a disease-modifying gene. However, the most interesting possibility is that 
      either dominant or recessive alleles act at a major susceptibility locus for bipolar 
      disorder on chromosome 21. Testable predictions result from the major susceptibility 
      locus models. In order to investigate these hypotheses further, the present authors 
      suggest the following: (1) further studies of the prevalence of bipolar disorder in 
      DS; and (2) the reporting of all cases of bipolar disorder in trisomy 21 with 
      details of the meiotic origin of the non-disjunction and details about affective 
      disorder in relatives of the proband.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Screening tests for Trisomy 21 (T21), also known as Down syndrome, are 
      routinely performed for the majority of pregnant women. However, current tests rely 
      on either evaluating non-specific markers, which lead to false negative and false 
      positive results, or on invasive tests, which while highly accurate, are expensive 
      and carry a risk of fetal loss. We outline a novel, rapid, highly sensitive, and 
      targeted approach to non-invasively detect fetal T21 using maternal plasma DNA. 
      METHODS AND FINDINGS: Highly heterozygous tandem Single Nucleotide Polymorphism 
      (SNP) sequences on chromosome 21 were analyzed using High-Fidelity PCR and Cycling 
      Temperature Capillary Electrophoresis (CTCE). This approach was used to blindly 
      analyze plasma DNA obtained from peripheral blood from 40 high risk pregnant women, 
      in adherence to a Medical College of Wisconsin Institutional Review Board approved 
      protocol. Tandem SNP sequences were informative when the mother was heterozygous and 
      a third paternal haplotype was present, permitting a quantitative comparison between 
      the maternally inherited haplotype and the paternally inherited haplotype to infer 
      fetal chromosomal dosage by calculating a Haplotype Ratio (HR). 27 subjects were 
      assessable; 13 subjects were not informative due to either low DNA yield or were not 
      informative at the tandem SNP sequences examined. All results were confirmed by a 
      procedure (amniocentesis/CVS) or at postnatal follow-up. Twenty subjects were 
      identified as carrying a disomy 21 fetus (with two copies of chromosome 21) and 
      seven subjects were identified as carrying a T21 fetus. The sensitivity and the 
      specificity of the assay was 100% when HR values lying between 3/5 and 5/3 were used 
      as a threshold for normal subjects. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, a targeted approach, 
      based on calculation of Haplotype Ratios from tandem SNP sequences combined with a 
      sensitive and quantitative DNA measurement technology can be used to accurately 
      detect fetal T21 in maternal plasma when sufficient fetal DNA is present in maternal 
      plasma.

TI  - Brain dysgenesis in Cornelia de Lange syndrome.
PG  - 99-105
AB  - The neuropathological findings in a neonatal case of Cornelia de Lange syndrome 
      (CDLS) were described. Two different types of lesions were revealed in the affected 
      brain. The first type was classified as perinatal hypoxic-ischemic brain damage, 
      associated with cyanotic congenital heart anomalies: subarachnoideal, 
      intraventricular, and parenchymal hemorrhage, and multiple necrosis in the cerebral 
      white matter, basal ganglia, internal capsule, thalamus, mammillary bodies and 
      dentate nucleus. This type may be non-specific and common in premature babies dying 
      soon after birth. On the other hand, the second type was classified as congenital 
      dysgenesis of the brain: microbrachycephaly, immature or simple convolution pattern 
      of the cerebral gyri, thickened leptomeninges, persistent subpial granule cells, 
      hypoplasia of the anterior thalamic nuclei, neurohypophysis, lateral geniculate 
      body, cerebral peduncle, ventral pons and cerebellar internal granular layer, and 
      heterotopic cell nests in the cerebellar white matter. This type may indicate that 
      the maturation of the brain can be disturbed in the fetal period, particularly in 
      the mid-gestational period. In conclusion, pathognomonic or specific changes of CDLS 
      might be absent in the brain. However, congenital dysgenesis of the brain, 
      especially that found in the diencephalon and the cortico-ponto-cerebellar system, 
      may constitute morphologic evidence explaining the severe growth retardation and 
      neurological abnormalities in CDLS.

TI  - The phenotypic spectrum of organic acidurias and urea cycle disorders. Part 1: the 
      initial presentation.
PG  - 1041-57
LID - 10.1007/s10545-015-9839-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The clinical presentation of patients with organic acidurias (OAD) and 
      urea cycle disorders (UCD) is variable; symptoms are often non-specific. 
      AIMS/METHODS: To improve the knowledge about OAD and UCD the E-IMD consortium 
      established a web-based patient registry. RESULTS: We registered 795 patients with 
      OAD (n = 452) and UCD (n = 343), with ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency 
      (n = 196), glutaric aciduria type 1 (GA1; n = 150) and methylmalonic aciduria (MMA; 
      n = 149) being the most frequent diseases. Overall, 548 patients (69 %) were 
      symptomatic. The majority of them (n = 463) presented with acute metabolic crisis 
      during (n = 220) or after the newborn period (n = 243) frequently demonstrating 
      impaired consciousness, vomiting and/or muscular hypotonia. Neonatal onset of 
      symptoms was most frequent in argininosuccinic synthetase and lyase deficiency and 
      carbamylphosphate 1 synthetase deficiency, unexpectedly low in male OTC deficiency, 
      and least frequently in GA1 and female OTC deficiency. For patients with MMA, 
      propionic aciduria (PA) and OTC deficiency (male and female), hyperammonemia was 
      more severe in metabolic crises during than after the newborn period, whereas 
      metabolic acidosis tended to be more severe in MMA and PA patients with late onset 
      of symptoms. Symptomatic patients without metabolic crises (n = 94) often presented 
      with a movement disorder, mental retardation, epilepsy and psychiatric disorders 
      (the latter in UCD only). CONCLUSIONS: The initial presentation varies widely in OAD 
      and UCD patients. This is a challenge for rapid diagnosis and early start of 
      treatment. Patients with a sepsis-like neonatal crisis and those with late-onset of 
      symptoms are both at risk of delayed or missed diagnosis.

TI  - Transient myeloproliferative disorder with erythroid differentiation in Down 
      syndrome.
PG  - 474-7
AB  - A newborn with a karyotype of 47, XY, +21 presented at birth with a white blood cell 
      count of 27 700/microL of which 61% were blast cells. The blast cell morphologic 
      structure was initially not characteristic of any particular lineage, although the 
      cytoplasm contained fine granules and occasional small vacuoles. Routine 
      cytochemical stains were negative, except one for nonspecific esterase that was 
      faintly positive in most of the blast cells. Flow cytometric analyses showed that 
      the blast cells expressed glycophorin A with a subset dimly coexpressing CD45 and 
      were negative for CD34, CD71, myeloid, lymphoid, and platelet-associated antigens. 
      These immunophenotypic findings were consistent with an abnormal erythroid 
      phenotype. A few days postpartum, markedly dysplastic erythroid precursor cells 
      appeared in the peripheral blood and increased in number as the early blast cells 
      decreased. After a period of subdued blast cell production, a second wave of 
      increase in the number of blast cells and dysplastic erythroblasts followed and 
      ended with the disappearance of circulating abnormal cells. The child is now 5 years 
      old and no major illness has been reported since the remission of this disorder. 
      This case most likely belongs to the category of transient myeloproliferative 
      disorders, although the erythroid-like phenotype of blast cells and the evidence of 
      single-lineage maturation to circulating dysplastic erythroid precursors allow the 
      suggestion that this process could represent a special form of a self-limited 
      hematologic disorder in Down syndrome.

TI  - Benefits of the Treatment and Education of Autistic and Communication Handicapped 
      Children (TEACCH) programme as compared with a non-specific approach.
PG  - 318-27
AB  - BACKGROUND: Two educational treatments were compared, the Treatment and Education of 
      Autistic and Communication Handicapped Children (TEACCH) programme and the 
      integration programme for individuals with disabilities. METHODS: Two groups of 
      eight subjects were matched by gender, chronological and mental age, and nosographic 
      diagnosis (i.e. autism associated with severe intellectual disability, DSM-IV 
      criteria and Childhood Autism Rating Scale scored. The TEACCH programme was applied 
      to the experimental group, while the control group was integrated in regular schools 
      with a support teacher. The Psycho-Educational Profile-Revised and the Vineland 
      Adaptive Behaviour Scale were administered twice with a one-year interval between 
      assessments. RESULTS: The scores of the experimental group increased more than the 
      control group scores. Statistically significant differences were obtained in both 
      groups because of the differences in the two approaches.

TI  - Reproduction in Down syndrome.
PG  - 13S-7S
AB  - A new case of pregnancy in a 29-year-old woman with trisomy 21 is described. She 
      gave birth to a male infant, chromosomally and phenotypically normal, who died the 
      day after delivery due to prematurity. Thirty pregnancies of 26 affected mothers, 
      including the present woman, resulted in 10 children with Down syndrome, 18 children 
      (1 set of twins) without Down syndrome, and 3 spontaneous abortions. Although rare, 
      pregnancies in women with Down syndrome could become more frequent, increasing the 
      importance of genetic, reproductive, and obstetric problems. These problems are 
      reviewed with special reference to the occurrence of nonspecific abnormalities in 
      chromosomally normal children, difficulties in labor and delivery, and frequency of 
      prematurity and low birth weight.

TI  - On the influence of age on immunity in Down's syndrome.
PG  - 77-87
AB  - In 23 subjects of different ages with Down's syndrome a number of parameters of 
      non-specific defense of humoral and cellular immunity were investigated. While in 
      all age groups complement factors C3, C4 and C5 as well as phagocytosis and NBT 
      indices were in the normal range, a dysgammaglobulinaemia increasing with age with a 
      hyperglobulinaemia of the IgG, IgA and IgD types was found, sparing immunoglobulins 
      IgM and IgE. In addition the transformation capacity of peripheral blood lymphocytes 
      decreased with age. This is understood as the consequence of premature aging of the 
      thymus-dependent immune system.

TI  - Tau antisera recognize neurofibrillary tangles in a range of neurodegenerative 
      disorders.
PG  - 514-20
AB  - Neurofibrillary tangles occur in a number of apparently distinct neurodegenerative 
      diseases and in normal aging of the human brain. Antibodies raised against 
      Alzheimer's disease paired helical filaments immunolabel the tangles seen in all 
      other tangle-associated disorders examined to date. The neuronal 
      microtubule-associated protein, tau, has recently been identified as an antigenic 
      component of neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaque neurites in Alzheimer's 
      disease. Three different polyclonal antibodies with strong tau immunoreactivity are 
      examined in this study. These antibodies were found to immunostain tangles in normal 
      aged brain and in brains affected by a range of neurodegenerative disorders, 
      including Down's syndrome, Alzheimer's disease plus Parkinson's disease, progressive 
      supranuclear palsy, and the parkinsonism-dementia complex of Guam, as well as Pick 
      bodies in Pick's disease. The findings further illustrate the relative 
      nonspecificity of neurofibrillary lesions in neurodegenerative disorders.

TI  - Nonspecific immunity in Down syndrome: a study of chemotaxis, phagocytosis, 
      oxidative metabolism, and cell surface marker expression of polymorphonuclear cells.
PG  - 384-91
AB  - We have investigated several aspects of nonspecific immunity in Down syndrome (DS), 
      utilizing peripheral polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL), obtained from 12 children 
      aged 8-16, diagnosed as trisomy 21, and their healthy matched controls. We used the 
      under agarose method for chemotaxis assays, and flow cytometry for the determination 
      of phagocytosis of monodispersed fluorescent beads, metabolic burst activity, and 
      neutrophil surface marker expression on these cells. Our results indicate that a 
      chemotactic defect exists in PMNL of DS children. However, no statistically 
      significant differences were found between PMNL from DS children and those from 
      controls in phagocytosis, oxidative burst, and expression of the markers CD11a, 
      CD11b, CD16, and CD 18. Furthermore, no overexpression of CD11a and CD18 was present 
      as a consequence of gene overdosage in PMNL from DS children. On the other hand, 3 
      different neutrophil subpopulations could be observed according to the CD16 staining 
      pattern in DS children and controls; this might be a consequence of genetic 
      variation or may represent different states of activation of these cells. Other 
      factors such as T-cell involvement, and the role of cytokines, cyclic nucleotides, 
      and zinc serum levels in DS patients should be further investigated in order to 
      define the causes of the immunological derangement present in this condition.

TI  - Fast mapping of words and story recall by individuals with Down syndrome.
PG  - 1286-300
AB  - This study compared adolescents with Down syndrome to nonverbal mental-age matched 
      controls in their ability to fast map new noun vocabulary in spoken story contexts. 
      Context for novel words varied within subjects in the distance between mentions 
      (close-distant) and the ease of inferring a real word for the referent 
      (specificity). The 23 participants with Down syndrome (DS) were aged 12.8-20.3 
      years. The 24 typically developing (TD) children, matched on visual nonverbal mental 
      age (MA), were 4.1 to 6.1 years old. Participants listened to 4 tape-recorded 
      stories, each containing 3 mentions of 2 novel words in close or distant proximity 
      and with clear or uncertain reference, and recalled each story after presentation. 
      Fast-mapping production was measured by the occurrence of the novel word in story 
      recall. Fast-mapping comprehension was measured by asking children to define the 
      novel words. The DS group did not differ from the TD group in novel word production 
      but seemed to have more difficulty with novel word definition. For both groups, 
      novel word production was higher in the nonspecific than the specific referent 
      condition, suggesting that availability of a real word label interfered with fast 
      mapping. Recall of story propositions was poorer for the DS group. For both groups, 
      story recall was better for text units not directly associated with novel words than 
      for text units containing novel words, suggesting a trade-off effect in processing. 
      Regression analyses indicated that syntax comprehension, rather than mean length of 
      utterance, predicted novel word production in both groups; MA additionally 
      contributed to predict DS story recall.

AB  - Menkes disease is a congenital disorder caused by changes in copper metabolism 
      derived from mutations in the ATP7A gene. It is characterized by physical and 
      neurological alterations. In the neonatal period, these alterations can be 
      nonspecific, which makes early diagnosis a challenge. Diagnosis can be suspected 
      when there are low levels of ceruloplasmin and serum copper. Molecular analysis 
      confirms the diagnosis. Treatment is parenteral administration of copper histidine. 
      We report a familial case with molecular confirmation. The proband had clinical and 
      biochemical suspicious. Treatment with copper histidine was indicated, but initiated 
      at the age of 2 months and 27 days only. He did not present improvements and died at 
      6 months. The mother became pregnant again, a male fetus was identified and copper 
      histidine was manufactured during pregnancy. He was born healthy, biochemical 
      markers were reduced and treatment was indicated. Molecular analysis was performed 
      confirming mutation in both the mother and the proband, while the other son did not 
      have mutation, so treatment was discontinued. We support the clinical relevance of 
      molecular confirmation for the correct diagnosis and genetic counseling, once 
      clinical findings in the neonatal period are nonspecific and early treatment with 
      parenteral copper histidine must be indicated.

AB  - The cognitive deficits in Down syndrome (DS) are attributed to an excessive 
      hippocampal inhibition, which obstructs neuronal plasticity and normal learning and 
      memory, a view which is largely based on studies of Ts65Dn mice, the best 
      characterized mouse model of DS. The cognitive behavioral deficits of Ts65Dn mice 
      can be rescued by reducing GABAergic inhibition, most selectively by partial inverse 
      agonists acting on α(5) GABA-A receptors, of which one compound has recently entered 
      clinical trials in DS. Most remarkably, the improved cognitive performance of Ts65Dn 
      can persist for weeks and months after cessation of drug treatment, as demonstrated 
      for the non-specific GABA antagonist pentylenetetrazole. The Alzheimer drugs, 
      memantine and donepezil largely fail to show any benefit. Finally, repeated 
      non-invasive sensory stimulation such as over-training or enriching the environment, 
      are able to enhance the learning performance which underlines the reversibility of 
      an obstructed neuronal plasticity in Ts65Dn mice.

AB  - Adrenoleukodystrophy is a genetic diseases classified in the group of peroxisomal 
      disorders caused by mutations in ABCD1, gene located on the X chromosome (Xq28). It 
      demonstrates X-linked recessive inheritance. There is an accumulation of very 
      long-chain fatty acids (VLCFA) in plasma and all tissues in the process of ALD. No 
      causal treatment for ALD is known, although hematopoietic stem cell transplantation 
      (HSCT) and gene therapy are allowed for early diagnosis in childhood cerebral form. 
      The case report describes three of the brothers suffering from ALD, diagnosed in 
      different stages of disease. The eldest brother was diagnosed by the age of nine, 
      with the first symptom of hearing loss. After that, test was also conducted in boy's 
      younger brother - he was then asymptomatic, however diagnosed with ALD at age 7. The 
      mutation in the ABCD1 gene was also detected in the mother's blood. Due to the 
      significant severity of the disease, the eldest boy was not qualified for HSCT. 
      Nowadays, 2 years after, the health condition of the eldest brother is severe. The 
      middle brother underwent HSCT. Currently, the he is in a good general condition. The 
      youngest brother had genetic testing performed shortly after birth. The mutation in 
      the ABCD1 gene also was confirmed, but in this moment there is no regarding to HSCT. 
      His development is adequally to age, but he has adrenal insufficiency. All of

      (including prenatal tests) are very important because ALD is associated with severe 
      course and high mortality, and its symptoms are non-specific.

TI  - Nonspecific and specific immune responses in a child with Down's syndrome and her 
      sibling. A case report.
PG  - 249-53
AB  - In a child with Down's syndrome (DS) and her sibling, host immune responses were 
      evaluated under experimental gingivitis conditions. The children live in the same 
      environment under identical conditions. In the DS child an earlier and more 
      extensive gingival inflammation than in her sibling had been observed. Investigation 
      of nonspecific host defense mechanisms revealed identical results in both children 
      for the phagocytosis and intracellular killing of Candida albicans by 
      polymorphonuclear leukocytes in crevicular washings (CR-PMNs), in blood (PB-PMNs) 
      and blood monocytes. Furthermore, CR- and PB-PMNs were able to secrete identical 
      amounts of hydrogen peroxide upon stimulation. The chemotactic response of PB-PMNs 
      in the DS child was impaired, however. The results of the studies performed on 
      parameters of specific host defense mechanisms showed low blastogenic responses to 
      phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and pokeweed (PWM) by lymphocytes of the DS child as 
      compared with her sibling. Also a lack of immune regulation leading to prolonged 
      helper/inducer cell activation on a local (gingival) and circulation level and a 
      less pronounced T-cell depression in PB were shown. Together, these differences 
      observed in specific and nonspecific host response mechanisms may be responsible for 
      the earlier and more extensive gingival inflammation found in the DS child.

      alkaline phosphatase between normal individuals and patients with trisomy 21.
PG  - 282-6
AB  - Biochemical, cytochemical characteristics and electron microscopy subcellular 
      distribution of neutrophil alkaline phosphatase (NAP) were analysed in blood and/or 
      smear samples from 39 trisomy 21 patients (Down's syndrome) aged 11.5-18 years (mean 
      15.5 years) and 55 normal subjects aged 12-20.5 years (mean 17 years). All patients 
      were karyotyped. NAP cytochemical procedures were carried out on all subjects; 
      biochemical NAP determinations were made in 10 patients and 20 controls; 
      ultrastructural electron microscopy of AP was performed in three patients and four 
      normal subjects. Neutrophil alkaline phosphatase from patients with trisomy 21 
      displayed the following changes: (1) a significant increase of enzyme activity, (2) 
      a high thermal lability of enzyme. Electron microscope morphology exhibited large 
      deposits of NAP reaction product associated with the plasma membrane and 
      intracellular main organelles, like phosphasomes. The NAP biochemical and 
      cytochemical characteristics suggest that trisomy 21 neutrophils contain a 
      non-specific AP isoenzyme, closely related to the early placental form.

LID - 10.1016/j.ejmg.2011.05.008 [doi]
AB  - Dup(X)(p11.22-p11.23) has been shown to be associated with intellectual disability 
      (ID, also referred to as mental retardation). Here, we characterize a 4.64 Mb de 
      novo duplication of the same Xp11.22-p11.23 ID region in a female, but for this 
      reference case the diagnosis was Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Besides ASD, she 
      also had very persistent trichotillomania, anxiety symptoms and some non-specific 
      dysmorphic features. We report the detailed clinical features, as well as refine the 
      rearrangement breakpoints of this disease-associated copy number variation region, 
      which encompasses more than 50 genes. We propose that in addition to ID, the 
      phenotypic spectrum associated with dup(X)(p11.22-p11.23) can include ASD, language 
      impairment, and/or other primary psychiatric disorders.

TI  - Recognition of identity and expression in faces by children with Down syndrome.
PG  - 466-79
AB  - The ability of three groups of children (with Down syndrome, age-matched with 
      nonspecific developmental delay, and younger typically developing) to recognize 
      identity and expression in adult faces was examined. In Experiment 1, the children 
      with Down syndrome were equally proficient at recognizing unfamiliar faces when 
      expression was varied but significantly poorer at recognizing expression overall, 
      with a specific deficit in perceiving surprise and fear. In Experiment 2, using 
      rotated faces, they were significantly worse at recognizing expression as well as at 
      identifying known faces. These results, in conjunction with lack of any improvement 
      with age, suggest that there is a specific deficit in processing facial expressions 
      associated with Down syndrome, a finding consistent with the emerging picture of 
      neurological disruption in this syndrome.

TI  - Rett Syndrome Mutant Neural Cells Lacks MeCP2 Immunoreactive Bands.
PG  - e0153262
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0153262 [doi]
LID - e0153262
AB  - Dysfunctions of MeCP2 protein lead to various neurological disorders such as Rett 
      syndrome and Autism. The exact functions of MeCP2 protein is still far from clear. 
      At a molecular level, there exist contradictory data. MeCP2 protein is considered a 
      single immunoreactive band around 75 kDa by western-blot analysis but several 
      reports have revealed the existence of multiple MeCP2 immunoreactive bands above and 
      below the level where MeCP2 is expected. MeCP2 immunoreactive bands have been 
      interpreted in different ways. Some researchers suggest that multiple MeCP2 
      immunoreactive bands are unidentified proteins that cross-react with the MeCP2 
      antibody or degradation product of MeCP2, while others suggest that MeCP2 
      post-transcriptional processing generates multiple molecular forms linked to cell 
      signaling, but so far they have not been properly analyzed in relation to Rett 
      syndrome experimental models. The purpose of this study is to advance understanding 
      of multiple MeCP2 immunoreactive bands in control neural cells and p.T158M MeCP2e1 
      mutant cells. We have generated stable wild-type and p.T158M MeCP2e1-RFP mutant 
      expressing cells. Application of N- and C- terminal MeCP2 antibodies, and also, RFP 
      antibody minimized concerns about nonspecific cross-reactivity, since they react 
      with the same antigen at different epitopes. We report the existence of multiple 
      MeCP2 immunoreactive bands in control cells, stable wild-type and p.T158M 
      MeCP2e1-RFP mutant expressing cells. Also, MeCP2 immunoreactive bands differences 
      were found between wild-type and p.T158M MeCP2e1-RFP mutant expressing cells. Slower 
      migration phosphorylated band around 70kDa disappeared in p.T158M MeCP2e1-RFP mutant 
      expressing cells. These data suggest that threonine 158 could represent an important 
      phosphorylation site potentially involved in protein function. Our results clearly 
      indicate that MeCP2 antibodies have no cross-reactivity with similar epitopes on 
      others proteins, supporting the idea that MeCP2 may exist in multiple different 
      molecular forms and that molecular pattern variations derived from altered 
      post-transcriptional processing may underlay Rett syndrome physiophatology.

TI  - MN1 C-terminal truncation syndrome is a novel neurodevelopmental and craniofacial 
      disorder with partial rhombencephalosynapsis.
PG  - 55-68
LID - 10.1093/brain/awz379 [doi]
AB  - MN1 encodes a transcriptional co-regulator without homology to other proteins, 
      previously implicated in acute myeloid leukaemia and development of the palate. 
      Large deletions encompassing MN1 have been reported in individuals with variable 
      neurodevelopmental anomalies and non-specific facial features. We identified a 
      cluster of de novo truncating mutations in MN1 in a cohort of 23 individuals with 
      strikingly similar dysmorphic facial features, especially midface hypoplasia, and 
      intellectual disability with severe expressive language delay. Imaging revealed an 
      atypical form of rhombencephalosynapsis, a distinctive brain malformation 
      characterized by partial or complete loss of the cerebellar vermis with fusion of 
      the cerebellar hemispheres, in 8/10 individuals. Rhombencephalosynapsis has no 
      previously known definitive genetic or environmental causes. Other frequent features 
      included perisylvian polymicrogyria, abnormal posterior clinoid processes and 
      persistent trigeminal artery. MN1 is encoded by only two exons. All mutations, 
      including the recurrent variant p.Arg1295* observed in 8/21 probands, fall in the 
      terminal exon or the extreme 3' region of exon 1, and are therefore predicted to 
      result in escape from nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. This was confirmed in 
      fibroblasts from three individuals. We propose that the condition described here, 
      MN1 C-terminal truncation (MCTT) syndrome, is not due to MN1 haploinsufficiency but 
      rather is the result of dominantly acting C-terminally truncated MN1 protein. Our 
      data show that MN1 plays a critical role in human craniofacial and brain 
      development, and opens the door to understanding the biological mechanisms 
      underlying rhombencephalosynapsis.

TI  - First diagnosis of severe mental handicap: characteristics of unsatisfactory 
      encounters between doctors and parents.
PG  - 53-62
AB  - This paper presents data from a study of 190 parents and discusses their reactions 
      to being told that their child was likely to be severely mentally handicapped. 
      Dissatisfaction was related to the child's age when the parents were first told 
      about the impairment, which was itself related to the diagnosis of the child's 
      condition. Parents of children with non-specific handicap were often not informed 
      about the impairment until the second or third year of the child's life, while 
      parents of children with Down's Syndrome were usually informed within a week of 
      birth. The paper compares these two groups of parents and discusses the reasons for 
      their dissatisfaction. The study showed that parents valued early acknowledgement of 
      the problem, a sympathetic approach on the part of medical professionals, and the 
      sharing of information and uncertainty. The reasons why parents of mentally 
      handicapped children may continue to feel dissatisfied are discussed in the light of 
      the theoretical literature on doctor-patient communication.

OAB - Parents of 190 severely mentally handicapped children served by two health districts 
      in southeast England were interviewed to determine their reactions on being told of 
      their children's handicap. The degree of satisfaction was positively related to 
      early disclosure, a sympathetic approach by health personnel, sharing of 
      information, and acknowledgement of uncertainty in diagnosis and prognosis. Parents 
      of children with Down's syndrome, which can be diagnosed early, were generally more 
      satisfied than parents whose children had handicaps of unknown pathology. Parents 
      who encountered evasion, denial, and delay were dissatisfied. The authors briefly 
      describe several lines of research aimed at improving professional parent 
      communication.

PG  - 257-9
AB  - A new born with a mongoloid slant, brachycephaly and low-set ears presented at birth 
      with a total leucocyte count of 57 x 10(3)/microL and the differential leucocyte 
      count revealed 70% of these to be blasts. The morphology of the blasts was not 
      characteristic of myeloid and lymphoid lineage. Cytochemistry showed myeloperoxidase 
      (MPO), Sudan Black B (SBB), periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) and non-specific esterase 
      (NSE) negativity. Flowcytometry showed blasts that were positive for CD-33, CD-34 
      and CD-7. On second follow-up on the 10th day, the same picture persisted on 
      morphology. On subsequent follow-up, the blasts disappeared. This was thus confirmed 
      to be a case with transient leukemia with Downs syndrome.

TI  - Segmental trisomy of chromosome 17: a mouse model of human aneuploidy syndromes.
PG  - 4500-5
AB  - Triplication of whole autosomes or large autosomal segments is detrimental to the 
      development of a mammalian embryo. The trisomy of human chromosome (Chr) 21, known 
      as Down's syndrome, is regularly associated with mental retardation and a variable 
      set of other developmental anomalies. Several mouse models of Down's syndrome, 
      triplicating 33-104 genes of Chr16, were designed in an attempt to analyze the 
      contribution of specific orthologous genes to particular developmental features. 
      However, a recent study challenged the concept of dosage-sensitive genes as a 
      primary cause of an abnormal phenotype. To distinguish between the specific effects 
      of dosage-sensitive genes and nonspecific effects of a large number of arbitrary 
      genes, we revisited the mouse Ts43H/Ph segmental trisomy. It encompasses >310 known 
      genes triplicated within the proximal 30 megabases (Mb) of Chr17. We refined the 
      distal border of the trisomic segment to the interval bounded by bacterial 
      artificial chromosomes RP23-277B13 (location 29.0 Mb) and Cbs gene (location 30.2 
      Mb). The Ts43H mice, viable on a mixed genetic background, exhibited spatial 
      learning deficits analogous to those observed in Ts65Dn mice with unrelated trisomy. 
      Quantitative analysis of the brain expression of 20 genes inside the trisomic 
      interval and 12 genes lying outside on Chr17 revealed 1.2-fold average increase of 
      mRNA steady-state levels of triplicated genes and 0.9-fold average down-regulation 
      of genes beyond the border of trisomy. We propose that systemic comparisons of 
      unrelated segmental trisomies, such as Ts65Dn and Ts43H, will elucidate the pathways 
      leading from the triplicated sequences to the complex developmental traits.

TI  - Pervasive developmental disorders in Prader-Willi syndrome: the Leuven experience in 
      59 subjects and controls.
PG  - 1136-42
AB  - In the present study we investigated the co-morbidity of pervasive developmental 
      disorder (PDD) in 59 Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) individuals and in 59 non-specific 
      mentally retarded controls, matched for IQ, gender, and age. The 'Pervasive 
      Developmental Disorder Mentally Retardation Scale' (PDD-MRScale), a screening 
      questionnaire based on the DSM-III-R criteria for PDD, has been applied in the PWS 
      group and in the control group. Results of the present study revealed a striking 
      autistic-like behavioral phenotype in the majority of the PWS individuals, 
      particularly deficits in the quality of language and communication and of 
      imagination and interests. This intersection with autistic symptomatology is an 
      important addition to the behavioral phenotype in PWS persons. A first approach to 
      delineate subtypes of autistic symptomalogy among PWS persons was performed. 
      Nineteen percent of the PWS group did meet the full diagnostic DSM-III-R criteria 
      for PDD in comparison with 15% in the control group. Results revealed that a higher 
      IQ in PWS does not protect to develop genuine PDD and that uniparental 
      disomy/imprinting mutation as genetic origin seems to be an additional risk factor 
      for developing genuine PDD. The results of the present study suggest the importance 
      of reconsidering the commonly recognized obsessive-compulsive like behavior in PWS 
      persons within the broader spectrum of autism disorders.

TI  - Epidemiology of prenatal genetic and environmental factors of mental retardation in 
      cuba.
PG  - 29-36
LID - 10.37757/MR2008.V10.N1.9 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: One of the most sensitive disabilities in human beings is intellectual 
      disability. In April, 2003, a 10-month study was completed of all persons in Cuba 
      with mental retardation (MR), producing results that included epidemiological 
      variables on a national scale. OBJECTIVE: Through follow-up research, this paper 
      describes and analyzes 4 prenatal factors associated with MR: Down syndrome (DS), 
      fragile X syndrome (FXS), consanguinity, and maternal alcohol use during pregnancy, 
      in order to provide recommendations for health system decision-makers on 
      consolidating prevention strategies at the community level and improving individual 
      attention to persons with MR. Materials & METHODS: All studies were carried out on 
      the basis of strict ethical principles. Data for the 4 prenatal factors was gleaned 
      from the national study's database. Additional data on affected individuals was 
      obtained through home visits. A previously developed screening instrument was used 
      for clinical genetic analysis to classify possible MR causal factors as prenatal, 
      perinatal, postnatal, psychosis, and unclassifiable. Prenatal included causal 
      factors such as: genetic (by clinical genetic examination, metabolic screening in 
      urine, and routine karyotypes); nonspecific (evidence of prenatal causal factor 
      without diagnosis of genetic or environmental etiology); and environmental (prenatal 
      medical history of biological, physical, or chemical teratogens, endocrine-metabolic 
      diseases, or other maternal diseases known to affect fetal neurodevelopment). 
      Frequency, prevalence, and percentages were reported using a descriptive statistical 
      method. Impact of interventions and actions over time were also compared. RESULTS: 
      MR prevalence in Cuba is 1.25%, lower than the value of 2%-3% reported in developed 
      countries. National prevalence of DS was found to be 4.3 per 10,000 population, 
      representing 22.1% of persons with MR attributed to an ascertained genetic cause. 
      FXS prevalence in a population of individuals of both sexes with MR, initially 
      classified as nonspecific prenatal, psychosis, and unclassifiable, was 2.5 per 1,000 
      of that population; however, in males of the same population, prevalence was 3.7 per 
      1,000. At this first stage, such results indicate that this syndrome contributes 
      biologically to the 1.46:1 male/female ratio among the 140,489 individuals with MR. 
      Maternal alcohol use during pregnancy was found in 4.22% of persons with MR and 
      consanguinity was present in 6.89% of the population with MR (10.9% of persons with 
      mild prenatal MR and 14.2% with severe MR). This national data is subdivided by 
      regions and provinces in this paper. CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of MR in Cuba is lower 
      than reference values for developed countries. Knowledge generated by this study 
      about 4 specific causes of MR constitutes pioneering research in the Cuban context, 
      contributing to the field of medical genetics. The results offer the basis for 
      formulation of new scientific contributions related to MR genetics as well as 
      preventive approaches to such genetic factors as consanguinity and to environmental 
      factors such as maternal alcohol use during pregnancy, which affect or target 
      embryo-fetal development of the nervous system.

AB  - Down syndrome (DS) is often associated with cardiac malformations, so that kidney 
      damage is little known. The objective of this study was to present the diversity of 
      renal abnormalities and their potential progression to chronic renal failure. Among 
      congenital abnormalities of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) abnormalities 
      appear to be frequent: pyelectasis, megaureters, posterior urethra valves, as well 
      as renal malformations such as renal hypoplasia, horseshoe kidney, or renal ectopia. 
      Contributing factors to acute kidney failure have been described in patients with 
      DS: bilateral lesions and minor renal injury, such as glomerular microcysts, tubular 
      dilation, and immature glomeruli. Histological lesions can be found, albeit 
      nonspecific; they occur earlier than in the general population. Two metabolic 
      specificities have also been described: decreased clearance of uric acid and a 
      hypercalciuria by passive hyperabsorption. End-stage renal disease can occur, thus 
      raising the problem of the best choice of management. In conclusion, renal 
      abnormalities in patients in DS should be known so as to preserve a good renal 
      functional prognosis: systematic screening with renal ultrasound can be proposed.

TI  - [Cases of Down's syndrome in children of young parents with chronic inflammatory 
      genital diseases and secondary disorders of spermatogenesis].
PG  - 38-41
AB  - Nine births affected by Down's disease in young families are reported. The mean age 
      of fathers was 28.5 years and that of mothers 25.2 years. History revealed no 
      parental exposures to occupational or household adverse factors or nutritional 
      contaminants. The parents had normal karyotypes. However, a history of urogenital 
      disease 1-3 years before the affected births was elucidated in all 9 families: three 
      cases of gonorrhea, one case of trichomoniasis and nonspecific inflammation in the 
      rest. After visits to genetic counseling clinics torpid urogenital infections were 
      identified in all 9 couples: nonspecific prostatitis and urethroprostatitis in 
      fathers, hysterosalpingoophoritis and vaginal dysbacteriosis in mothers. 
      Teratozoospermia and oligozoospermia with abnormal sperm cell proportions of 56 to 
      92% occurred in the fathers. It is suggested that infectious-toxic disorders of 
      chromosomal segregation during the meiosis may be a paternal cause of trisomy 21. 
      The same mechanism is feasible in mothers. After reversal of urogenital infections 
      and normalization of spermograms normal infants were born in 7 of 9 families, the 
      other 2 currently refrain from childbirth.

TI  - Malassezia Pneumonia: A Rare Complication of Parenteral Nutrition Therapy.
PG  - 1194-1196
AB  - Malassezia species (formerly known as Pityrosporum) are part of normal human skin 
      flora and have been associated with benign dermatologic conditions, such as 
      seborrheic dermatitis and tinea versicolor. In rare cases, however, Malassezia has 
      been associated with systemic disease in immunocompromised patients and infants in 
      the neonatal intensive care unit. Malassezia species require long-chain fatty acids 
      for growth and therefore have a known predilection for individuals receiving lipid 
      containing intravenous parenteral nutrition (PN). Systemic infections are 
      characterized by prolonged fevers and illness but can include nonspecific signs and 
      symptoms. We present the diagnosis and management of a rare case of an 
      immunocompetent, nonneonatal, PN-dependent child with Malassezia furfur pneumonia.

TI  - An overview of a 30-year experience with amniocentesis in a single tertiary medical 
      center in Taiwan.
PG  - 206-11

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Amniocentesis is a popular and effective prenatal diagnostic tool for 
      chromosomal disorders. It is well-established that the risk of chromosomal 
      abnormalities increases with maternal age; however, other related indications are 
      seldom reported. Herein, we report our 30-year experience with amniocentesis from a 
      single medical center, focusing on the indications and rates of abnormality. 
      MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective review of 16,749 pregnant women in the 
      mid-trimester between January 1981 and December 2010 was conducted. The medical 
      records were analyzed. RESULTS: The indications for amniocentesis were advanced 
      maternal age (≥ 34 years old) (n=10,970, 65.5%), increasing-risk maternal 
      triple-marker Down's screening test (≥ 1/270) (n=2090, 12.5%), history of abnormal 
      offspring birth (n=792, 4.7%), abnormal ultrasound findings (n=484, 2.9%), parent 
      with abnormal karyotype (n=252, 1.5%), family history of chromosomal abnormality 
      (n=183, 1.1%), drug and radiation exposure (n=165), abnormal chorionic villus 
      sampling (CVS) results (n=25), intrauterine fetal death (n=50), and other 
      non-specific causes (n=1662, 9.9%). The rate of abnormality for each indication was 
      16% in the abnormal CVS group, 12% in the intrauterine fetal death group, 11.5% for 
      parental chromosomal abnormality, 8.7% in the abnormal ultrasound finding group, 
      3.0% in the increasing-risk maternal triple-marker Down's screening test group, 2.5% 
      in the advanced maternal age group, 1.5% for other non-specific causes, 1.4% for 
      history of abnormal offspring birth, and 1.1% for family history of chromosomal 
      abnormality. CONCLUSIONS: Both parents with abnormal karyotype and abnormal 
      ultrasound findings are indications for which consideration of further amniocentesis 
      is highly recommended.

TI  - On the frequency of telomeric chromosomal changes induced by culture conditions 
      suitable for fragile X expression.
PG  - 160-2
AB  - Under culture conditions suitable for the expression of the fragile site Xq27, 
      "nonspecific" telomeric structural changes similar to the "specific" fra(X) 
      formation occurred apparently on every chromosome arm. Significant differences 
      between individuals seem to exist. The total frequency of nonspecific terminal 
      lesions not located on the long arm of the X chromosome was 0.22 +/- 0.17 per cell 
      in 37 cultures examined. If telomeric lesions on Xq occur in more than 0.7% of the 
      cells from a single culture in males and more than 1.5% of the cells from a single 
      culture in females, then this probably indicates a specific fra(X) expression. Lower 
      percentages may be the result of nonspecific telomeric structural changes in q. 
      These are expected to occur in the normal X as well and may, therefore, give rise to 
      false positive diagnoses in the detection of hemi-, and hetero-, and perhaps also 
      homozygous fra(X) carriers.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the clinical characteristics and treatment effects of children 
      with acute megakaryoblastic leukemia without down syndrome (non-DS-AMKL). METHODS: 
      The clinical data of 19 children with non-DS-AMKL treated in the Pediatric 
      Hematology Ward in Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University from May 
      2008 to April 2018 were analyzed retrospectively. The clinical characteristics, 
      laboratory test and treatment methods of the children were concluded. All patients 
      were followed up to evaluate the effect of treatment. RESULTS: The 19 cases of 
      children included nine male and ten female, the median age of onset was 2 years old. 
      The clinical manifestations showed nonspecific. The median white blood cell of 
      peripheral blood was 15.88×10(9)/L, the median hemoglobin was 67 g/L and median 
      platelet was 16×10(9)/L. An increase of primitive and naive megakaryocytes was found 
      in the bone marrow sample. The immunophenotypes of bone marrow detected by flow 
      cytometry in 19 children were all positive expressed for CD41, CD61. Genetic tests 
      showed that five cases carrying EVI1, including one complicating with MLL/AF10, one 
      patient carrying HOX11, one carrying GATA1, IKZF1 and DDX11 mutations, one patient 
      carrying missense mutation of NRAS, one with missense mutation of KRAS and two cases 
      with high expression of WT1. Karyotype analysis were performed in 11 cases of 
      children, including four with normal karyotype, four with complex karyotypes, one 
      with trisomy 8, one with 7/13 trisomy 21 without Down syndrome manifestations 
      (considered as abnormal somatic karyotype) and one Robertsonian translocation 
      carrier involving chromosomes 14 and 21. Ten children received treatment, including 
      three cases with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) 
      after complete remission (CR), two cases with complete donor implantation, and one 
      without implanted but hematopoietic recovered, these three children were followed up 
      for 26, 15 and 12 months respectively and the minimal residual disease (MRD) were 
      all less than 10(-4). Another three cases achieving CR after chemotherapy but 
      relapsed in 5, 10 and 12 months after the onset respectively, and all the three 
      children were died eventually. One children died of pulmonary hemorrhage during 
      chemotherapy and three children died from discontinuation of treatment after non 
      remission. The remaining nine children died because of without chemotherapy 
      treatment. CONCLUSION: Non-DS-AMKL was rare in children and difficult to be 
      diagnosed. Determination of MICM classification as early as possible was helpful for 
      diagnosis, and genetic testing played an important role for diagnosis and prognosis 
      evaluation. Early hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in patients with CR after 
      chemotherapy might be an effective way to cure AMKL.

TI  - Forensic issues in Down syndrome fatalities.
PG  - 475-81
AB  - Down syndrome, or trisomy 21, is the most common chromosomal abnormality associated 
      with intellectual impairment. Premature death is a feature of the syndrome due to a 
      wide variety of conditions including congenital heart disease, impaired immune 
      responses resulting in respiratory infections, acute leukaemia, upper airway 
      narrowing, pulmonary hypertension, Alzheimer disease and atlantoaxial instability. 
      Cases of Down syndrome not uncommonly present for medicolegal autopsy, as the 
      non-specificity of symptoms and signs often precludes accurate antemortem 
      establishment of a cause of death. Manifestations of Down syndrome are reviewed with 
      an analysis of possible mechanisms of death and findings at autopsy.

      testing: the importance of autosomal genes for diagnosis.
PG  - 478-483
LID - 10.1111/cge.12575 [doi]
AB  - Genetic testing for non-specific intellectual disability (ID) presents challenges in 
      daily clinical practice. Historically, the focus of the genetic elucidation of 
      non-specific ID has been on genes on the X chromosome, and recent research has 
      brought attention to the growing contribution of autosomal genes. In addition, 
      next-generation sequencing (NGS) has greatly improved the ability to simultaneously 
      analyze multiple genetic loci, making large panel testing a practical approach to 
      testing for non-specific ID. We performed NGS analysis of a total of 90 genes 
      implicated in non-specific ID. The 90 genes included 56 X-linked genes and 34 
      autosomal genes. Pathogenic variants were identified in 11 of 52 (21%) patient 
      samples. Nine of the eleven cases harbored mutations in autosomal genes including 
      AP4B1, STXB1, SYNGAP1, TCF4 and UBE3A. Our mutation-positive cases provide further 
      evidence supporting the prevalence of autosomal mutations in patients referred for 
      non-specific ID testing and the utility of their inclusion in multi-gene panel 
      analysis.

AB  - CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: WAC-related intellectual disability (ID) is typically 
      characterized by variable degrees of developmental delay and/or intellectual 
      disability. Behavioral abnormalities including anxiety, 
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and/or autism spectrum disorder are 
      observed in the majority of older children and adults. Most affected infants have 
      significant but nonspecific features at birth such as neonatal hypotonia and feeding 
      problems. Some affected individuals come to medical attention with respiratory or 
      vision problems. Facial features may be mildly dysmorphic, but are nonspecific. To 
      date, 18 individuals have been identified with WAC-related ID. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: 
      The diagnosis of WAC-related ID is established in a proband by identification of a 
      heterozygous pathogenic variant in WAC on molecular genetic testing. MANAGEMENT: 
      Treatment of manifestations: Standard treatment of developmental delay / 
      intellectual disability, behavioral abnormalities, neonatal hypotonia, and feeding 
      problems. Surveillance: Regular dietary evaluation in infancy to ensure optimal 
      nutritional status; routine monitoring of developmental progress and educational 
      needs; assessment for anxiety, attention, and aggressive or self-injurious behavior. 
      GENETIC COUNSELING: WAC-related ID is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. 
      With the exception of one family with presumed parental germline mosaicism, all 
      individuals diagnosed to date have the disorder as the result of a de novo 
      pathogenic variant. Once the WAC pathogenic variant has been identified in an 
      affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and 
      preimplantation genetic testing are possible.

TI  - Second trimester screening for Down's syndrome using maternal serum dimeric inhibin 
      A.
PG  - 17-21
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Prenatal maternal serum screening for Down's syndrome has 
      become an important and established part of modern antenatal care. Previously it has 
      been reported that non-specific immunoreactive inhibin may be useful in this 
      context. Using a novel assay we have evaluated dimeric inhibin A as a possible 
      second trimester marker of Down's syndrome. METHODS: From 1992-1993 records, stored 
      sera from women with Down's affected pregnancies and chromosomally normal control 
      pregnancies were identified and retrieved for analysis. These sera had been 
      prospectively collected at 15, 16 and 17 weeks gestation. SUBJECTS: Records revealed 
      21 women who had had a Down's syndrome pregnancy and who also had serum available 
      for analysis. Sera from 150 chromosomally normal controls, matched for gestation and 
      duration of storage, were also retrieved. MEASUREMENTS: Dimeric inhibin A was 
      measured using a recently developed two-site enzyme-linked immunoassay. This employs 
      a capture anti inhibin beta A-subunit monoclonal antibody, covalently bound to a 
      microtitre plate and a second anti inhibin alpha-subunit antibody conjugated to 
      alkaline phosphatase, allowing detection. RESULTS: The mean (95% CI) maternal serum 
      dimeric inhibin A in the samples from control pregnancies was 237 (201.5-273.4) 
      ng/l, 266.9 (235.4-298.5) ng/l and 207.2 (178.5-235.9) ng/l at 15, 16 and 17 weeks 
      gestation respectively. Expressing the results from the Down's samples as multiples 
      of the normal median (MoM), the median (95% CI) MoM was 2.6 (2.25-3.57), 
      significantly higher than the controls (P < 0.0001, Mann-Whitney U-test). In the 
      sample set tested, for a given false positive rate of 5.3% inhibin A alone afforded 
      a detection rate of 62%, detecting cases previously undetected by routine screening. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Dimeric inhibin A appears to be a promising new marker for the prenatal 
      detection of Down's syndrome. Further prospective evaluation and assessment with 
      other established markers would now be merited.

TI  - Chromosome aberrations in a schizophrenia population.
PG  - 1-7
AB  - Cytogenetic abnormalities with schizophrenia may provide a valuable clue to the 
      identification of target loci and successful search for major genes. We have 
      performed chromosomal examinations by using the GTG banding technique on 134 
      schizophrenics. In 43 patients (32%), random numerical and structural aberrations 
      were detected. Structural aberrations predominated and usually consisted of 
      deletions and inversion of various chromosomes. Numerical changes were present in 
      one or two cells in 14 cases including trizomy 21, marker and acentric chromosomes, 
      and 47,XXY. The seven cases with pericentric inversion and enlargement of the 
      heterochromatin region of chromosome 9 (inv(9); 9qh+) were observed in the study. 
      The incidence (5.2%) of inv(9) and 9qh+ in our schizophrenic patients were found 
      higher than the general population, suggesting that a susceptibility locus for 
      schizophrenia may be located at pericentromeric region of chromosome 9. Our study 
      have detected 1q21, 7q23, inv(9), 9qh+, 11q23, 21q22, 22q11-13 and Xp11-q13 
      suggested that these chromosomal lesions are prevalent in schizophrenics. The reason 
      for this might be that these anomalies increase risk for schizophrenia in a 
      relatively nonspecific way, such as contributing to disruption of normal 
      embryogenesis of the nervous system.

TI  - Sonographic markers of fetal trisomies: second trimester.
PG  - 655-74
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Second-trimester sonographic findings of fetal trisomy may include 
      structural abnormalities or sonographic markers of fetal aneuploidy. Unlike 
      structural anomalies, sonographic markers of fetal aneuploidy are insignificant by 
      themselves with regard to outcome, are nonspecific--most frequently seen in normal 
      fetuses, and are often transient. Our objective was to review the second-trimester 
      sonographic findings of the major trisomic conditions, trisomies 13, 18, and 21. 
      METHODS: We reviewed a number of the most commonly accepted markers, including 
      nuchal thickening, hyperechoic bowel, echogenic intracardiac focus, renal 
      pyelectasis, shortened extremities, mild cerebral ventricular dilatation, and 
      choroid plexus cysts. Markers associated with trisomy 21 were emphasized. RESULTS: 
      The sensitivity of sonography for detection of fetal trisomic conditions varies with 
      the type of chromosome abnormality, gestational age at the time of sonography, 
      reasons for referral, criteria for positive sonographic findings, and the quality of 
      the sonography. As an estimate, 1 or more sonographic findings can be identified in 
      approximately 90% of fetuses with trisomy 13, 80% of fetuses with trisomy 18, and 
      50% to 70% of fetuses with trisomy 21 (Down syndrome). CONCLUSIONS: The presence or 
      absence of sonographic markers can substantially modify the risk of fetal Down 
      syndrome and is the basis of the so-called genetic sonogram. Because maternal 
      biochemical and sonographic markers are largely independent, combined risk estimates 
      will result in even higher detection rates than either alone.

TI  - How do individuals with Williams syndrome learn a route in a real-world environment?
PG  - 454-468
LID - 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2009.00894.x [doi]
AB  - Individuals with Williams syndrome (WS) show a specific deficit in visuo-spatial 
      abilities. This finding, however, derives mainly from performance on small-scale 
      laboratory-based tasks. This study investigated large-scale route learning in 
      individuals with WS and two matched control groups (moderate learning difficulty 
      group [MLD], typically developing group [TD]). In a non-labelling and a labelling 
      (verbal information provided along the route) condition, participants were guided 
      along one of two unfamiliar 1-km routes with 20 junctions, and then retraced the 
      route themselves (two trials). The WS participants performed less well than the 
      other groups, but given verbal information and repeated experience they learnt 
      nearly all of the turns along the route. The extent of improvement in route 
      knowledge (correct turns) in WS was comparable to that of the control groups. 
      Relational knowledge (correctly identifying spatial relationships between 
      landmarks), compared with the TD group, remained poor for both the WS and the MLD 
      group. Assessment of the relationship between performance on the large-scale 
      route-learning task and that on three small-scale tasks (maze learning, perspective 
      taking, map use) showed no relationship for the TD controls, and only a few 
      non-specific associations in the MLD and WS groups.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cross-sectional study was carried out to determine the frequency of 
      subtelomeric abnormalities in children with idiopathic mental retardation (MR). 
      METHOD: Multiplex ligation-dependant probe amplification technique was used to 
      detect subtelomeric abnormalities. RESULTS: Out of 35 children, 21 (60%) were males. 
      Family history of MR was present in 23%. Main clinical features included speech 
      delay in all motor delay cases (83%) and non-specific dysmorphic features (77%). 
      CONCLUSION: Associated clinical features were more in children with intelligence 
      quotient (IQ) < 50 (P < 0.05). Subtelomeric deletion (4q35) was observed in one 
      child.

TI  - Derangement of non-specific immunity in Down syndrome subjects: low leukocyte 
      chemiluminescence activity after phagocytic activation.
PG  - 242-6
AB  - Metabolic activation of peripheral blood leukocytes (chemiluminescence) from 27 
      children with Down syndrome (DS) and 23 age and sex-matched control children after 
      phagocytic stimulation by opsonized zymosan particles was investigated through a 
      chemiluminescence assay. Using autologous plasma or serum as opsonizing media, 
      phagocytic activity of circulating leukocytes was significantly decreased in DS 
      subjects. A further decrease of phagocytic activity was found in neutrophils from DS 
      children, when normal heterologous plasma or sera were used. On the other hand, sera 
      or plasma from DS subjects significantly increased phagocytic activation of 
      leukocytes from normal donors. In DS subjects opsonizing agents such as serum 
      immunoglobulins and complement fractions were in the normal ranges of concentration. 
      Thus, the impaired chemiluminescence of neutrophils was mainly due to a metabolic 
      impairment at the cellular level. A decreased production of radicals derived from 
      the oxygen metabolism in neutrophils may be an important step of immune derangement 
      leading to the increased incidence of infectious diseases frequently associated with 
      DS.

      disability.
PG  - 15018
LID - 10.1038/hgv.2015.18 [doi]
AB  - The mediator complex subunit 12 gene (MED12) is responsible for an X-linked 
      recessive intellectual disability syndrome that is characterized by dysmorphic 
      features such as a long, narrow face and blepharophimosis, which is now recognized 
      as an MED12-related syndrome. We identified a novel non-synonymous single-nucleotide 
      variant, p.Ile1023Val, in a male patient with non-specific X-linked intellectual 
      disability (XLID). Our results, together with the existence of similar reports, 
      suggest a relationship between MED12 variants and XLID.

TI  - Lower alkaline phosphatase activity and occurrence of an abnormal hybrid 
      intestinal/tissue non-specific isoform in Down's syndrome amniotic fluids.
PG  - 17-24
AB  - Quantitative and qualitative analysis of alkaline phosphatases (AP) was performed on 
      amniotic fluid in 59 normal pregnancies and 14 Down's syndrome (DS) pregnancies at 
      16, 18 and 19 weeks of gestation. In DS cases, intestinal and placental isoenzyme 
      levels were significantly reduced (P<0.001) and the AP electrophoretic pattern was 
      seen to be modified on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A unique component was 
      detected. After extraction and purification of the abnormal isoenzyme, peptide 
      fragments obtained after cyanogen bromide cleavage indicated a hybrid heterodimeric 
      AP composed of intestinal and tissue non-specific subunits, as evaluated by SDS 
      polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

TI  - The recurrence of sonographic 'soft markers': ominous sign or 'just' genetics?
PG  - 469-472
LID - 10.1002/pd.5034 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: 'Soft markers' (SMs) are nonspecific findings that might convey a higher 
      risk for Down syndrome. We sought to determine the recurrence rate of the most 
      common SM in subsequent pregnancies. METHODS: This is a retrospective study of all 
      women who underwent early or late fetal sonographic anatomical screening in our 
      ultrasound unit. The examined SMs were pyelectasis, thickened nuchal fold (TNF) and 
      echogenic intracardiac foci (EIF). Data on recurrence and pregnancy outcome were 
      retrieved retrospectively. RESULTS: The database included 20 672 singleton 
      pregnancies; SMs were detected in 2347 (11.1%) of the fetuses and were isolated in 
      1739 (74%). Rates of solitary findings in the pregnancies were 6.5% (1360/20 672) 
      EIF, 3% (624/18 850) TNF and 1.7% (363/20 672) pyelectasis. The recurrence rate of 
      EIF, TNF and pyelectasis in subsequent consecutive pregnancies was 21%, 27% and 16%, 
      respectively. Overall, 62 cases of Down syndrome were diagnosed in (1 : 333 
      pregnancies). No cases were diagnosed in patients with recurrent SMs. CONCLUSION: 
      The high recurrence rate of solitary SM implies for genetic predisposition. These 
      results might improve our counseling for pregnant women affected by the reappearance 
      of solitary SM. Further studies are needed to assess the likelihood ratio for SM if 
      recurrence occurs. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Use of genetic sonography for adjusting the risk for fetal Down syndrome.
PG  - 130-44
AB  - Systematic evaluation of ultrasound findings known to be associated with trisomy 21, 
      at an appropriate gestational age, has been referred to as a genetic sonogram. A 
      number of high-risk centers performing genetic sonography have reported detection of 
      ultrasound abnormalities in the majority of fetuses with fetal Down syndrome. 
      However, nonspecific markers are more commonly observed than structural 
      abnormalities, which are detected in less than 20% of cases in a nonselected 
      population. Also, the actual sensitivity of a genetic sonogram will depend on 
      various factors including the markers sought, gestational age, reasons for referral, 
      and of course the quality of the ultrasound. Appropriate use of a genetic sonogram 
      can help to modify the risk of fetal Down syndrome by decreasing the risk when the 
      ultrasound is normal, or increasing the risk when specific ultrasound markers are 
      detected. The postultrasound risk can be estimated by applying specific likelihood 
      ratios, reflecting the strength of individual markers, with the a priori risk based 
      on maternal age alone, or combined with biochemical markers when known. We review 
      this approach of age-adjusted ultrasound risk assessment for fetal Down syndrome and 
      illustrate how the risk can be estimated. Individual sonographic markers are also 
      discussed.

TI  - Plasma thyrotropin bioactivity in Down's syndrome children with subclinical 
      hypothyroidism.
PG  - 1-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Subclinical hypothyroidism occurs in a number of children with Down's 
      syndrome (DS). The reason for the mildly elevated plasma thyrotropin (TSH) 
      concentrations is not known. The present study investigated whether decreased TSH 
      bioactivity plays a role in this phenomenon. DESIGN: A retrospective study of plasma 
      specimens from DS children with mildly elevated plasma TSH concentrations and 
      thyroid hormone levels within the reference range, using a TSH receptor-adenylate 
      cyclase mediated bioassay. METHODS: Strain JP26 Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, 
      stable transfected with the human TSH receptor, were incubated with unfractionated 
      plasma (1/10 diluted in hypotonic incubation medium) of 10 DS children with 
      subclinical hypothyroidism and nine euthyroid children with insulin-dependent 
      diabetes mellitus as controls. cAMP released in the incubation medium was measured 
      by RIA. Mock-transfected CHO cells were used to correct for non-specific CHO 
      response. WHO Second International Reference Preparation of human TSH was dissolved 
      and diluted in pooled normal human plasma and simultaneously bioassayed to match 
      patient and control results. RESULTS: Plasma TSH levels were slightly increased in 
      DS (mean +/- S.D., 6.5+/-1.3 mU/l, reference range 0.4-4.0 mU/l). Plasma TSH levels 
      for controls (1.3+/-0.4 mU/l) were within the reference range. Plasma thyroid 
      hormone levels in patients and controls were normal, plasma TSH binding inhibitory 
      immunoglobulin and thyroid peroxidase antibodies were negative. cAMP levels 
      (corrected for non-specific CHO response) in DS patients (18.4+/-3.9 pmol/well) and 
      in controls (14.3+/-1.3 pmol/well) did not significantly differ from cAMP levels 
      generated by patient-TSH equivalent TSH standards (16.3+/-0.9 pmol/well). 
      CONCLUSIONS: The present results demonstrate normal TSH bioactivity in plasma of DS 
      children, indicating that subclinical hypothyroidism in these patients is of primary 
      (thyroidal) origin.

      Review.
PG  - 100-102
LID - 10.4103/jpn.JPN_2_19 [doi]
AB  - The Solute Carrier Family 6 Member 1 (SLC6A1) gene encodes the gamma-aminobutyric 
      acid (GABA) transporter 1, which is one of the main GABA transporters. The clinical 
      picture of SLC6A1 gene mutations is characterized by a broader spectrum including a 
      mild-to-moderate intellectual disability, speech difficulties, behavioral problems, 
      epilepsy (often with myoclonic-atonic and atypical absence seizures, characterizing 
      a myoclonic-atonic epilepsy), and neurological signs. We describe a boy with an 
      SLC6A1 mutation and a milder phenotype, characterized by a learning disorder without 
      intellectual disability, nonspecific dysmorphisms, and an electroencephalogram 
      picture closely resembling that of myoclonic-atonic epilepsy with brief absence 
      seizures that have appeared during the follow-up, responsive to valproic acid.

TI  - DNA recognition by the methyl-CpG binding domain of MeCP2.
PG  - 3353-60
AB  - The methyl-CpG binding domain (MBD) of the transcriptional repressor MeCP2 has been 
      proposed to recognize a single symmetrically methylated CpG base pair via 
      hydrophobic patches on an otherwise positively charged DNA binding surface. We have 
      tested this binding model by analysis of mutant derivatives of the MeCP2 MBD in 
      electrophoretic mobility shift assays complemented by NMR structural analysis. 
      Exposed arginine side chains on the binding face, in particular Arg-111, were found 
      to be critical for binding. Arg-111 was found to interact with the conserved 
      aspartate side chain Asp-121, which is proposed to orientate the arginine side chain 
      to allow specific contacts with the DNA. The conformational flexibility of the 
      disordered B-C loop region, which forms part of the binding face, was also shown to 
      be important. In contrast, mutation of the exposed hydrophobic side chains had a 
      less severe effect on DNA binding. This suggests that the Arg-111 side chain may 
      contribute to sequence-specific recognition of the CpG site rather than simply 
      making nonspecific contacts with the phosphate backbone. The majority of missense 
      mutations within the MBD found in the human genetic disorder Rett syndrome were 
      shown or predicted to affect folding of the domain rather than the DNA recognition 
      event directly.

TI  - Prader-Willi syndrome and central nervous system calcifications: chance or 
      fundamentally related findings?
PG  - 6-10
AB  - The central nervous system of a 16 8/12-year-old boy with Prader-Willi syndrome is 
      described. Extensive calcifications of the central nervous system were observed at 
      autopsy as grittiness of the brain slices and verified by X-ray and microscopy. The 
      encrustations were particularly localized in the leptomeninges, the first and second 
      layer of the cerebral and cerebellar cortex and along the ventricular system. We 
      suggest that the alterations are nonspecific and perhaps secondary to a fundamental 
      metabolic disorder in the central nervous system.

TI  - Patterns of congenital anomalies among individuals with trisomy 13 in Texas.
PG  - 1787-1793
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.a.62175 [doi]
AB  - Few population-based studies have analyzed patterns of co-occurring birth defects 
      among those with trisomy 13. We evaluated the frequency of all possible combinations 
      of any one, two, three, or four additional co-occurring birth defects among 736 
      individuals with trisomy 13 using data from the Texas Birth Defects Registry for 
      deliveries during 1999-2014. We calculated the observed-to-expected ratio for each 
      combination, adjusting for the known tendency for birth defects to cluster 
      non-specifically. To address potential ascertainment differences among live births 
      and non-live births, we repeated analyses specifically among live births. The 
      combination of defects with the largest observed-to-expected ratio was 
      microcephalus, reduction deformities of brain (e.g., holoprosencephaly), anomalies 
      of nose, and polydactyly. As expected, most of the highest 30 observed-to-expected 
      ratios involved combinations with documented features of trisomy 13, including 
      defects of the scalp (e.g., aplasia cutis) and heart. Results were similar among 
      sensitivity analyses restricted to live births. Our findings may help further 
      delineate the phenotypic spectrum for trisomy 13 and may inform future research 
      related to improving screening and counseling for the condition.

TI  - Reduced urinary serotonin excretion after intake of high doses of hypoxanthine.
PG  - 337-40
AB  - Two healthy volunteers were treated with hypoxanthine 3 x 1 g and allopurinol 3 x 
      100 mg daily for 1 week. During this treatment serum oxypurine concentration and 
      urinary oxypurine excretion increased as expected. No side effects were observed 
      except for some mild daytime drowsiness and lethargy. Measurements of urinary 
      serotonin (5-HT) excretion showed decreases to as much as 60% below initial values. 
      Decreased urinary 5-HT excretion was also found in a patient with incomplete 
      Lesch-Nyhan syndrome during treatment with high doses of hypoxanthine. His 
      neurological symptoms improved slightly. The results suggest that high doses of 
      hypoxanthine exert a nonspecific sedative effect on both patients with Lesch-Nyhan 
      syndrome and healthy controls. The cause is probably a reduced synthesis or release 
      of 5-HT.

TI  - Impaired neutrophil functions in the pathogenesis of an outbreak of recurrent 
      furunculosis caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus among mentally 
      retarded adults.
PG  - 1801-5
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus is an important cause of skin infections. We recently 
      described an outbreak of recurrent furunculosis involving methicillin-resistant S. 
      aureus among mentally retarded adults. We sought to determine the role of impaired 
      neutrophil functions in its pathogenesis. Blood neutrophil functions were determined 
      during both the outbreak (1997) and a disease-free period (2000). Chemotaxis was 
      measured by migration toward formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP), 
      specifically and randomly; phagocytosis of opsonized zymosan (OZ) was assessed by 
      microscopy; superoxide production was determined by cytochrome c reduction in 
      unstimulated neutrophils and after stimulation with 50 ng/ml phorbol myristate 
      acetate, 1 mg/ml OZ or 5 x 10(-7)M FMLP. Functions were compared between recurrent 
      furunculosis (n=10) and non-recurrent furunculosis patients (n=13). During 2000, 
      functions were normal among the 23 subjects, except for specific/nonspecific 
      chemotaxis (mean 68%+/-26 and 69%+/-28). During infection, recurrent furunculosis 
      patients had a significantly increased basal superoxide production as compared to 
      disease-free period (10.5+/-4.7 vs. 4.9+/-1.9 nmol O(-)(2)/10(6) cells/min, 
      p=0.003). During the disease-free period, recurrent furunculosis patients had lower 
      basal superoxide production (4.9+/-1.9 vs. 7.7+/-3.5, p=0.067) and impaired specific 
      chemotaxis (57%+/-28 vs. 76%+/-21, p<0.05) as compared to non-recurrent furunculosis 
      patients. Only specific chemotaxis was an independent risk factor for recurrent 
      furunculosis. Mentally retarded adults have impaired chemotaxis, with recurrent 
      furunculosis cases having an even greater impairment. Abnormal specific chemotaxis 
      is an independent risk factor for recurrent furunculosis. Impaired neutrophil 
      functions thus have a role in the pathogenesis of outbreaks of recurrent 
      furunculosis.

TI  - Immunomodulating activity of Pidotimod in children with Down syndrome.
PG  - 253-8
AB  - Acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) are the most frequent illnesses in 
      pediatric age, frequently experienced in children with Down Syndrome (DS) due to the 
      associated immune defects of both specific and non-specific immunity. Pidotimod, a 
      synthetic immunostimulant, was shown to reduce the rates of ARTIs in children with 
      DS, however the mechanisms associated with this effect is currently unknown. We 
      analyzed immune parameters in DS children who received the seasonal 20112012 
      virosomal-adjuvanted influenza vaccine. Eighteen children aged 3-10 years (mean age 
      7.1+/-2.6 years) were randomly assigned (1:1 ratio) to receive Pidotimod 400 mg, 
      administered orally once a day for 90 days or placebo. At the recruitment (T0) all 
      children received a single dose of virosomal-adjuvanted influenza vaccine (Flu). 
      Blood samples were collected at T0 and 3 months after the recruitment (T3) in order 
      to evaluate innate and adaptative immune responses pathway. Flu-specific IgG1 and 
      IgG3 levels in plasma samples were determined at pre-vaccination (T0), and 1 (T1) 
      and 3 months (T3) post-vaccination. The use of Pidotimod was associated with the 
      upregulation of a number of genes involved in the activation of innate immune 
      responses and in antimicrobial activity. Interestingly the ratio of Flu-specific 
      IgG1/IgG3 was skewed in pidotimod-treated individuals, suggesting a preferential 
      activation of complement-dependent effector mechanisms. Although preliminary these 
      data suggest that Pidotimod can potentiate the beneficial effect of immunization, 
      possibly resulting in a stronger activity of both innate and adaptive immune 
      responses.

      microcephaly (typically 2-3 SD below the mean); teeth anomalies (dental caries, 
      malocclusion, and supernumerary teeth); cardiac anomalies (most typically atrial 
      and/or ventricular septal defects); prenatal ventriculomegaly and hydrocephalus; 
      cryptorchidism in males; and renal malformations (most commonly unilateral renal 
      agenesis). More rarely, affected individuals may have hypergonadotropic hypogonadism 
      (in females), seizures, poor growth, feeding difficulties, hearing loss, refractive 
      errors and/or other eye abnormalities, vertebral anomalies, micro/retrognathia, and 
      imperforate / anteriorly placed anus. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of THOC6 
      intellectual disability syndrome is established in a proband with biallelic 
      pathogenic variants in THOC6 identified by molecular genetic testing. For 
      individuals from the Hutterite population suspected of having THOC6 intellectual 
      disability syndrome, molecular genetic testing for the specific c.136G>A 
      (p.Gly46Arg) founder variant can be considered. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of 
      manifestations: For those with poor weight gain, feeding therapy and consideration 
      of a gastrostomy tube; for those with hearing loss, hearing aids may be considered; 
      standard treatment for seizures, vision issues, dental caries/malocclusion, cardiac 
      malformations, genital anomalies, hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, renal 
      malformations, skeletal anomalies, and developmental delay / intellectual 
      disability. Surveillance: At each visit: monitor developmental progress, mobility, 
      self-help skills, and behavior; assess for signs and symptoms of hydrocephalus or 
      for new neurologic manifestations; measurement of growth parameters and evaluation 
      of nutritional status; assessment of vision and eye alignment; assessment for dental 
      caries and malocclusion. Evaluate renal function (BUN, creatinine, and urinalysis) 
      at each visit or annually for those with anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract; 
      annual audiology evaluation; evaluation of secondary sexual characteristics and 
      menstrual cycles at each visit in females older than age 12 years. GENETIC 
      COUNSELING: THOC6 intellectual disability syndrome is inherited in an autosomal 
      recessive manner. At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance 
      of being affected, a 50% chance of being unaffected and a carrier, and a 25% chance 
      of being unaffected and not a carrier. Carrier testing for at-risk relatives and 
      prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk are possible if the pathogenic 
      variants have been identified in an affected family member.

TI  - In vitro correction of Hurler fibroblasts with bovine testicular hyaluronidase.
PG  - 642-9
AB  - Bovine testicular hyaluronidase (endo-beta-N-acetyl hexosaminidase) has a 
      significant corrective effect on cultured Hurler fibroblasts. Nonspecificity of this 
      effect is indicated by its equally strong corrective effect on Hunter fibroblasts. 
      Although all specimens of hyaluronidase also possessed iduronidase activity, a 
      separate corrective effect could be attributed to the endo-N-acetyl hexosaminidase 
      activity of at least one hyaluronidase (Wyeth M-151) for four reasons: (i) its very 
      low content of iduronidase activity; (ii) a decrease in intracellular macromolecular 
      mucopolysaccharides (believed to be largely dermatan sulfate) with a corresponding 
      increase in intracellular and extracellular oligosaccharides; (iii) no measurable 
      increase in iduronidase activity of hyaluronidase-treated cells despite near maximal 
      correction; (iv) direct correlation between Hurler cell correction and hyaluronidase 
      activity when enzymes of different strength were used at less than maximal 
      correction.

PG  - 41-2
AB  - Pneumoparotiditis is related to the cause of an infrequent increase in the size of 
      the parotid gland due to the entrance of air through the Stenon duct following an 
      increase in the pressure in the oral cavity. It is observed in musicians who play 
      wind instruments, glass blowers, patients undergoing diagnostic or therapeutic 
      techniques, in adolescents that provoke it intentionally, and in mentally 
      handicapped people as found in the clinical case reported here. The symptoms are 
      usually non-specific and the diagnosis is confirmed with an axial tomography. The 
      interest in this clinical case lies in the peculiar form of presentation and its 
      diagnostic confirmation through the use of CT imaging.

TI  - Thalamic lesions in a patient with Menkes kinky-hair disease.
PG  - 206-9
AB  - The thalamus in a patient with Menkes kinky-hair disease showed lesions involving 
      the large association and specific sensory relay nuclei and sparing the nonspecific 
      sensory relay nuclei. The results confirm the findings of Iwata et al. [1979] but 
      add the notion of a relative sparing of the microneurons which represent 40-50% of 
      the normal neuronal population in the medialis formation and 35-40% in the posterior 
      formation [Dom 1976]. Although axonal and/or cortical neuronal damage has 
      contributed some retrograde lesions, a primary thalamic degeneration probably 
      represents the most important pathogenetic factor. Whether this degeneration results 
      specifically from the deficiency of enzymes operative in copper metabolism in some 
      thalamic nuclei only remains purely speculative. Its clinical significance within 
      the syndrome dominated by a severe psychomotor retardation cannot be evaluated.

TI  - [Sister chromatid exchanges and chromosome aberrations as parameters for human risk 
      of cancer development].
PG  - 587-95
AB  - Chromosome alterations, which are directly visible changes in the DNA, have close 
      associations to cancer development, non-specific ageing, and heritable genetic 
      status. Human lymphocyte cultures can be used for cytogenetic monitoring of genetic 
      health because many cancers and genetic effects are caused by long-term unhealthy 
      life-styles. We have investigated the sensitivities of lymphocytes from 
      inherited-cancer-prone diseases to the induction of the chromosome alterations by 
      mutagens and carcinogens, and the correlations between the frequency of sister 
      chromatid exchanges (SCEs) in peripheral lymphocytes and life-styles or daily ways 
      of living. Lymphocytes from patients with Down syndrome, Fanconi anemia, xeroderma 
      pigmentosum, ataxia telangiectasia, and Bloom syndromes showed altered (usually 
      enhanced) susceptibilities to the induction of chromosome aberrations and SCEs by 
      mutagens and carcinogens in our environments. Mean frequencies of baseline SCEs in 
      lymphocytes from normal men with poor life-styles have also been shown to be 
      significantly higher than those in cells from men having good life-styles. The 
      former cells have further been shown to have hyper sensitivities to the induction of 
      SCEs by mitomycin-C' treatment compared to latter cells. Unhealthy life-styles also 
      make the lymphocytes to be more sensitive to ara-C's enhancement of 
      radiation-induced chromosome aberrations.

TI  - Identification of SETBP1 Mutations by Gene Panel Sequencing in Individuals With 
      Intellectual Disability or With "Developmental and Epileptic Encephalopathy".
PG  - 593446

LID - 593446
AB  - SETBP1 mutations are associated with the Schinzel-Giedion syndrome (SGS), 
      characterized by profound neurodevelopmental delay, typical facial features, and 
      multiple congenital malformations (OMIM 269150). Refractory epilepsy is a common 
      feature of SGS. Loss of function mutations have been typically associated with a 
      distinct and milder phenotype characterized by intellectual disability and 
      expressive speech impairment. Here we report three variants of SETBP1, two novel de 
      novo truncating mutations, identified by NGS analysis of an Intellectual Disability 
      gene panel in 600 subjects with non-specific neurodevelopmental disorders, and one 
      missense identified by a developmental epilepsy gene panel tested in 56 pediatric 
      epileptic cases. The three individuals carrying the identified SETBP1 variants 
      presented mild to severe developmental delay and lacked the cardinal features of 
      classical SGS. One of these subjects, carrying the c.1765C>T (p.Arg589(*)) mutation, 
      had mild Intellectual Disability with speech delay; the second one carrying the 
      c.2199_2203del (p.Glu734Alafs19(*)) mutation had generalized epilepsy, responsive to 
      treatment, and moderate Intellectual Disability; the third patient showed a severe 
      cognitive defects and had a history of drug resistant epilepsy with West syndrome 
      evolved into a Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. This latter subject carries the missense 
      c.2572G>A (p.Glu858Lys) variant, which is absent from the control population, 
      reported as de novo in a subject with ASD, and located close to the SETBP1 hot spot 
      for SGS-associated mutations. Our findings contribute to further characterizing the 
      associated phenotypes and suggest inclusion of SETBP1 in the list of prioritized 
      genes for the genetic diagnosis of overlapping phenotypes ranging from non-specific 
      neurodevelopmental disorders to "developmental and epileptic encephalopathy" (DEE).

PG  - 211-7
AB  - Ubiquitin has been shown to be a component of neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer's 
      disease. We now show immunocytochemically that it is also a component of 
      neurofibrillary tangles in several other neurodegenerative diseases of diverse 
      aetiology, including Down's syndrome, dementia pugilistica and postencephalitic 
      parkinsonism, and in normal ageing. Ubiquitin immunoreactivity is not, however, 
      generally found in the neurofibrillary tangles of progressive supranuclear palsy. 
      These findings show that while associated ubiquitin is not a feature unique to the 
      tangles of Alzheimer's disease, it is not simply a non-specific response to the 
      presence of an inclusion body within the cell. The observations suggest that 
      ubiquitin may have an important role in the formation of neurofibrillary tangles in 
      a variety of neurodegenerative diseases.

TI  - Acute hemiplegia and cortical blindness due to moya moya disease: report of a case 
      in a child with Down's syndrome.
PG  - 33-7
AB  - We are reporting what we believe to be the first case of moya moya disease 
      (hemiplegia associated with supraclinoid carotid stenosis and multiple cerebral 
      telangiectasia) in a child with Down's syndrome. On cerebral angiography, multiple 
      collateral vessels and rete mirabile (anastomosis of meningeal vessels with internal 
      cerebral vessels) were noted, in addition to the supraclinoid carotid stenosis. 
      Computerized tomography revealed nonobstructive hydrocephalus and findings 
      consistent with multiple vascular insults or infarcts. It is not clear whether moya 
      moya disease represents a true disease entity (congenital arterial dysplasia) or is 
      a syndrome caused by nonspecific vascular reaction. Since abnormal vascular 
      morphology has previously been described in children with trisomy 21, we suggest 
      that the presence of these two disease entities may not be coincidental. It may 
      represent a genetic predisposition in Down's syndrome toward vascular abnormalities, 
      with variable expressivity which manifested itself in this case by abnormalities in 
      the cerebral circulation.

TI  - A novel mutation in a common pathogenic gene (SETD5) associated with intellectual 
      disability: A case report.
PG  - 3737-3740
LID - 10.3892/etm.2019.8059 [doi]
AB  - Intellectual disability (ID) is a non-specific phenotype present in a genetically 
      heterogeneous group of disorders. The genetic cause of ID remains elusive in the 
      majority of patients due to this extreme heterogeneity. Whole exome sequencing 
      technology has been applied to identify pathogenic gene variants responsible for ID. 
      The present report described a 1.7-year-old female patient who had severe ID with 
      the specific features of delayed motor development, language disorders and abnormal 
      facial features. Exome analysis identified a novel pathogenic variant of the SETD5 
      gene [c.2025_2026delAG (p.Gly676Valfs*2)]. The variant was a frameshift mutation, 
      causing termination of the protein in advance. These findings indicated that this 
      mutation of the SETD5 gene may be a genetic cause for ID. The present study aimed to 
      provide a meaningful exploration of ID and the identification of clinical core 
      genetic pedigrees.

TI  - Three brothers with a nonsense mutation in KAT6A caused by parental germline 
      mosaicism.
PG  - 17045
LID - 10.1038/hgv.2017.45 [doi]
LID - 17045
AB  - Mutations in KAT6A, encoding a member of the MYST family of histone 
      acetyl-transferases, were recently reported in patients with a neurodevelopmental 
      disorder (OMIM: #616268, autosomal dominant mental retardation-32). In this report, 
      we describe three siblings with intellectual disability (ID) or global developmental 
      delay and a KAT6A heterozygous nonsense mutation, i.e., c.3070C>T (p.R1024*, 
      ENST00000406337; chr8:41795056G>A on hg19). This mutation was identified by 
      whole-exome sequencing of all three siblings but not in a healthy sibling. The 
      mutation was not detected in the peripheral blood of their parents, suggesting the 
      existence of parental germline mosaicism. The primary symptoms of our patients 
      included severe to profound ID or global developmental delay, including speech delay 
      with craniofacial dysmorphism; these symptoms are consistent with symptoms 
      previously described for patients with KAT6A mutations. Although several features 
      are common among patients with KAT6A mutations, the features are relatively 
      nonspecific, making it difficult to establish a clinical entity based on clinical 
      findings alone. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of cases with 
      a KAT6A mutation in an Asian population and these cases represent the first reported 
      instances of germline mosaicism of this disease.

TI  - Acute leukemia and the transient myeloproliferative disorder associated with Down 
      syndrome: morphologic, immunophenotypic and cytogenetic manifestations.
PG  - 1432-9
AB  - Individuals with Down syndrome have an increased incidence of leukemia compared to 
      the general population. In addition, Down syndrome children may acquire a 
      myeloproliferation that resembles acute leukemia that undergoes a spontaneous, 
      durable remission. To clarify the relationship between these two disorders, the 
      morphologic, immunophenotypic and cytogenetic characteristics of 28 patients with 
      Down syndrome and the morphologic manifestations of acute leukemia were examined. 
      Three cytomorphological groups were discerned. The first two groups consisted of 
      five patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (group I) and three patients with 
      acute myeloid leukemia (group II). These leukemias resembled those of non-Down 
      individuals. The third and largest group (group III) consisted of 20 cases of acute 
      myeloid leukemia that showed prominent megakaryocytic and/or erythroid 
      differentiation and occurred in children under 6 years of age. The blasts in this 
      group were non-reactive for myeloperoxidase or non-specific esterase and expressed 
      CD7, CD34 and CD36 with variable expression of CD61, CD13 and CD33. Four patients in 
      this group had an acquired trisomy 8. Four group III leukemias underwent a durable, 
      spontaneous remission within 2 months of diagnosis. There were no morphologic 
      differences between those leukemias in this group that progressed and those that 
      remitted; however, all remissions occurred in newborns. It is concluded that Down 
      syndrome children acquire a characteristic acute myeloid leukemia that has prominent 
      megakaryocytic and/or erythroid differentiation and an unusual immunophenotype. This 
      group of leukemias may undergo a durable, spontaneous remission in the newborn 
      period.

TI  - Single cell co-amplification of polymorphic markers for the indirect preimplantation 
      genetic diagnosis of hemophilia A, X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, X-linked 
      hydrocephalus and incontinentia pigmenti loci on Xq28.
PG  - 298-305
AB  - Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) first consisted of the selection of female 
      embryos for patients at risk of transmitting X-linked recessive diseases. Advances 
      in molecular biology now allow the specific diagnosis of almost any Mendelian 
      disease. For families with an identified X-linked recessive disease-causing 
      mutation, non-specific diagnosis by sex identification can be considered as a 
      sub-standard method, since it involves the unnecessary disposal of healthy male 
      embryos and reduces success rate by diminishing the pool of embryos eligible for 
      transfer. The most telomeric part of the X-chromosome long arm is a highly gene-rich 
      region encompassing disease genes such as haemophilia A, X-linked 
      adrenoleukodystrophy, X-linked hydrocephalus and incontinentia pigmenti. We 
      developed five single-cell triplex amplification protocols with microsatellite 
      markers DXS1073, DXS9901 (BGN), G6PD, DXS1108, DXS8087 and F8C-IVS13 located in this 
      Xq terminal region. These tests allow the diagnosis of all diseases previously 
      mentioned providing that the genetic material allowing the identification of the 
      morbid allele can be obtained. The choice of the microsatellite set to use depends 
      on the localisation of the gene responsible for the diagnosed pathology and on the 
      informativity of the markers in particular families. Single-cell amplification 
      efficiency was assessed on single lymphocytes. Amplification rate of the different 
      markers ranged from 89-97% with an allele drop out rate of 2-19%. So far PGD has 
      been carried out for three carrier females at risk of transmitting X-linked 
      adrenoleukodystrophy, X-linked hydrocephalus and hemophilia A. The latter one is now 
      pregnant.

TI  - Colonic necrosis because of strangulated recurrent Morgagni's hernia in a child with 
      Down's syndrome.
PG  - 589-91
AB  - Postoperative bowel obstruction complicating a recurrent Morgagni's hernia (MH) is 
      an uncommon condition and hence the presentation. Nonspecific symptoms and 
      misleading radiologic image may result in misdiagnosis and severe complications. We 
      report the case of a child with a transverse colon necrosis because of strangulation 
      in a misdiagnosed recurrent MH. The child presented with bowel obstruction and 
      repeated chest infections. Colonic necrosis could be avoided by timely diagnosis and 
      repair of MH. This severe and rare occurrence complicating a recurrent MH should be 
      kept in mind in children with respiratory tract infections and vomiting.

AB  - Hypophosphatasia (HPP) is a bone metabolic disorder caused by mutations in the 
      liver/bone/kidney alkaline phosphatase gene (ALPL), which encodes tissue-nonspecific 
      alkaline phosphatase (TNAP). This disease is characterized by disrupted bone and 
      tooth mineralization, and reduced serum AP activity. Along with bone and tooth 
      symptoms, many neurological symptoms, seizure, encephalopathy, intracranial 
      hypertension, mental retardation, deafness, and growth hormone deficiency (GHD), are 
      frequently found in HPP patients. Seizure occurs in severe HPP types soon after 
      birth, and responds to pyridoxine, but is an indicator of lethal prognosis. 
      Encephalopathy rarely presents in severe HPP types, but has severe sequelae. 
      Intracranial hypertension complicated in mild HPP types develops after the age of 1 
      year and sometimes need neurosurgical intervention. Mental retardation, deafness and 
      GHD are more frequently found in Japanese HPP patients. Mental retardation occurs in 
      all HPP types. Deafness in perinatal lethal type is both conductive and 
      sensorineural. GHD develops in all but perinatal lethal type and the diagnosis tends 
      to delay. The pathogenesis of these neural features of HPP might be due to 
      impairment of both vitamin B6 metabolism and central nervous system development by 
      ALPL mutations.

AB  - Social cognitive abilities - notably, Theory of Mind (ToM) and social information 
      processing (SIP) - are key skills for the development of social competence and 
      adjustment. By understanding affective and cognitive mental states and processing 
      social information correctly, children will be able to enact prosocial behaviors, to 
      interact with peers and adults adaptively, and to be socially included. As social 
      adjustment and inclusion are major issues for children with intellectual 
      disabilities (IDs), the present study aimed to explore their social cognitive 
      profile by combining cluster analysis of both ToM and SIP competence, and to 
      investigate the structure of relations between these skills in children with IDs. 
      Seventy-eight elementary school children with non-specific IDs were recruited. They 
      had a chronological age ranging from 4 years and 8 months to 12 years and 6 months 
      and presented a preschool developmental age. Performance-based measures were 
      administered to assess ToM and SIP abilities. Questionnaires were completed by the 
      children's parents to evaluate the children's social competence and adjustment and 
      their risk of developing externalizing or internalizing behaviors. Exploratory 
      analysis highlighted strengths and weaknesses in the social cognitive profiles of 
      these children with IDs. It also emphasized that the understanding of affective and 
      cognitive mental states was used differently when facing appropriate vs. 
      inappropriate social behaviors. The present study leads to a better understanding of 
      the socio-emotional profile of children with IDs and offers some suggestions on how 
      to implement effective interventions.

TI  - The malformations of the urinary system in autosomal disorders.
PG  - 167-78
AB  - Data from the world literature about the pathology of the urinary system in 
      autosomal chromosomal disorders are analyzed and compared with our own morphological 
      investigations of this system in 63 cases of chromosomal disorders (Patau's, 
      Edwards', Down's, Orbeli's, Wolf-Hirschhorn's syndromes, partial trisomy B and 
      inversion of chromosome 2). The urinary system is most frequently involved in 
      "cat-eye", triploidy, Orbeli's, Patau's and Edwards' syndromes. All known 
      malformations of the urinary system are observed in children with chromosomal 
      diseases, except infantile polycystic kidney and medullary "sponge" kidney. The 
      authors recognize specific and nonspecific abnormalities of the urinary system. 
      Nonspecific abnormalities, as simple renal dysgenesis, may be observed in all 
      chromosomal disorders. Specific abnormalities are found only in certain chromosomal 
      diseases. These malformations are an excess of embryonal lobulation of the kidney 
      with the increase of its weight and cystic changes (Patau's syndrome), crossed renal 
      ectopy with fusion and horseshoe kidney (Edwards' syndrome), unilateral renal 
      agenesis (Orbeli's syndrome), hypospadia (Wolf-Hirschhorn's syndrome). A possible 
      pathogenesis of malformations of the urinary system in chromosomal disorders is 
      discussed.

TI  - [A woman with beta-propeller protein-associated neurodegeneration identified by the 
      WDR45 mutation presenting as Rett-like syndrome in childhood].
PG  - 209-12
AB  - Beta-propeller protein-associated neurodegeneration (BPAN) is one of the 
      neurodegenerative disorders characterized by iron deposition in the brain and is the 
      only known disease in humans to be caused by an aberration in autophagocytosis. 
      Here, we present the case of a 42-year-old woman with BPAN identified by the WDR45 
      mutation. From early childhood, she was recognized as having global developmental 
      delay, and she frequently sucked her hand, which was considered to be a 
      stereotypical movement. She had a febrile convulsion at 6 months of age but there 
      was no history of epilepsy. The delay in language development was more severe than 
      the delay in motor development; she was able to dress herself, walk unaided, and 
      follow simple instructions until adolescence. After the age of 20, her movement 
      ability rapidly declined. By the time she was 42 years old, she was bedridden and 
      unable to communicate. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 21 years revealed 
      no abnormality except non-specific cerebral atrophy. However, MRI at 39 years 
      revealed abnormalities in the globus pallidus and substantia nigra, with 
      neurodegeneration and iron accumulation in the brain. Genetic analysis for WDR45 
      revealed that she had a splice site mutation (NM_007075.3: c.830 + 2 T > C) which 
      was previously reported, and a diagnosis of BPAN was confirmed. For specific 
      therapies to be developed for BPAN in the future, it is necessary to establish early 
      diagnosis, including genetic analysis.

PG  - 9-15
AB  - Muscle biopsies from a 13-month-old female infant with a delay in developmental 
      milestones, lactic acidosis and visual disturbance, and a 6 year-old female with 
      frequent epileptic fits are described. Biochemical studies of biopsied muscles and 
      skin fibroblasts demonstrated markedly decreased pyruvate dehydrogenase complex 
      (PDHC) activity to about 16% of normal value. Muscle histochemistry in both patients 
      showed disorganized intermyofibrillar networks containing large diformazan granules 
      on NADH-TR, small angulated fibers with high nonspecific esterase (NSE) activity and 
      basophilic fibers. Ragged-red fibers and increased lipid droplet accumulation were 
      absent. Patient 1 had increased numbers of type 2C fibers (11.3%) and mild fiber 
      type grouping. On electron microscopy, most mitochondria were nearly normal. There 
      were focal aggregates of mildly enlarged mitochondria in the subsarcolemmal areas in 
      both patients. Morphometric study showed that the mean mitochondrial size and the 
      mitochondrial percentage of fiber volume were not significantly different amongst 
      patients and normal controls.

TI  - Algorithmic approach for methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MECP2) gene testing in 
      patients with neurodevelopmental disabilities.
PG  - 346-54
LID - 10.1177/0883073811424796 [doi]
AB  - Methyl-CpG binding protein 2 gene (MECP2) testing is indicated for patients with 
      numerous clinical presentations, including Rett syndrome (classic and atypical), 
      unexplained neonatal encephalopathy, Angelman syndrome, nonspecific mental 
      retardation, autism (females), and an X-linked family history of developmental 
      delay. Because of this complexity, a gender-specific approach for comprehensive 
      MECP2 gene testing is described. Briefly, sequencing of exons 1 to 4 of MECP2 is 
      recommended for patients with a Rett syndrome phenotype, unexplained neonatal 
      encephalopathy, an Angelman syndrome phenotype (with negative 15q11-13 analysis), 
      nonspecific mental retardation, or autism (females). Additional testing for 
      large-scale MECP2 deletions is recommended for patients with Rett syndrome or 
      Angelman syndrome phenotypes (with negative 15q11-13 analysis) following negative 
      sequencing. Alternatively, testing for large-scale MECP2 duplications is recommended 
      for males presenting with mental retardation, an X-linked family history of 
      developmental delay, and a significant proportion of previously described clinical 
      features (particularly a history of recurrent respiratory infections).

TI  - [Cerebral white matter lesions in a case of incontinentia pigmenti with infantile 
      spasms, mental retardation and left hemiparesis].
PG  - 278-83
AB  - A Japanese girl with incontinentia pigmenti had characteristic skin lesions at 
      birth. The diagnosis was confirmed by skin biopsy and positive family history. Her 
      mother and sisters also suffered from IP. She had generalized tonic seizures at 1 
      month of age, and infantile spasms at 7 months. ACTH therapy was very effective to 
      infantile spasms. At 9 years now, she is suffering from atypical absence, mild 
      mental retardation and mild left hemiparesis. MRI revealed marked atrophy of the 
      cerebral white matter predominantly around the posterior horn of right lateral 
      ventricle, cystic lesions in the white matter around the anterior horns of both 
      lateral ventricles, which were not clear by CT scan, and atrophy of the right 
      cerebral peduncle and pontine basis. Although these findings are non-specific, they 
      may be clues which explicate the mechanism of central nervous system involvement in 
      incontinentia pigmenti.

AB  - We studied the eyes of two children with proven trisomy 21 and updated the 
      microscopic ocular findings. The ocular malformations, generally of a minor nature, 
      comprise a variety of nonspecific hyperplasia or hamartomata, hypoplasias, tissue 
      defects and heterotopias, and involve virtually every portion of the globe. Ocular 
      and extraocular abnormalities in Down's syndrome do not correlate well 
      embryologically, cytogenetically or in regard to incidence or severity. The type of 
      ocular anomalies usually encountered in trisomy 21 suggests that the globe was 
      affected by the chromosomal anomaly rather late in its development.

PG  - 577-85
LID - 10.1007/s10545-014-9712-9 [doi]
AB  - Thiamine, in the form of thiamine pyrophosphate, is a cofactor for a number of 
      enzymes which play important roles in energy metabolism. Although dietary thiamine 
      deficiency states have long been recognised, it is only relatively recently that 
      inherited defects in thiamine uptake, activation and the attachment of the active 
      cofactor to target enzymes have been described, and the underlying genetic defects 
      identified. Thiamine is transported into cells by two carriers, THTR1 and THTR2, and 
      deficiency of these results in thiamine-responsive megaloblastic anaemia and 
      biotin-responsive basal ganglia disease respectively. Defective synthesis of 
      thiamine pyrophosphate has been found in a small number of patients with episodic 
      ataxia, delayed development and dystonia, while impaired transport of thiamine 
      pyrophosphate into the mitochondrion is associated with Amish lethal microcephaly in 
      most cases. In addition to defects in thiamine uptake and metabolism, patients with 
      pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency and maple syrup urine disease have been described 
      who have a significant clinical and/or biochemical response to thiamine 
      supplementation. In these patients, an intrinsic structural defect in the target 
      enzymes reduces binding of the cofactor and this can be overcome at high 
      concentrations. In most cases, the clinical and biochemical abnormalities in these 
      conditions are relatively non-specific, and the range of recognised presentations is 
      increasing rapidly at present as new patients are identified, often by genome 
      sequencing. These conditions highlight the value of a trial of thiamine 
      supplementation in patients whose clinical presentation falls within the spectrum of 
      documented cases.

TI  - Argininosuccinic Acid Lyase Deficiency Missed by Newborn Screen.
PG  - 43-47
LID - 10.1007/8904_2016_2 [doi]
AB  - Argininosuccinic acid lyase (ASL) deficiency, caused by mutations in the ASL gene 
      (OMIM: 608310) is a urea cycle disorder that has pleiotropic presentations. On the 
      mild end, ASL deficiency can manifest as nonspecific neurocognitive abnormalities 
      without readily identifiable signs to differentiate it from other causes of 
      intellectual disability or learning disabilities. Dietary management and arginine 
      supplementation, if initiated early, may ameliorate symptoms.Because of the 
      nonspecific nature of the symptoms and the possibility for therapeutic management, 
      ASL deficiency is part of the recommended uniform screening panel for newborn 
      screening in the USA. We report here a case of ASL deficiency that was missed on 
      newborn screening in the USA.The case reported here has two known pathogenic 
      mutations - one with no residual activity and one with reported 10% residual 
      activity. Review of this newborn screening results showed subtle elevation of 
      citrulline, overlapping the normal range. These findings suggest that newborn 
      screening may be missing other patients with ASL deficiency with at least one 
      hypomorphic allele. This case was diagnosed incidentally, but in retrospect had 
      symptoms best attributed in full or in part to his ASA deficiency, including protein 
      aversion, developmental delay, and seizures. This case highlights the importance of 
      considering ASL deficiency in patients with nonspecific abnormal neurocognitive 
      signs, such as epilepsy and developmental delay, even when newborn screening was 
      normal.

TI  - Aetiology of premature ovarian failure.
PG  - 72-5
LID - 10.1258/mi.2009.009020 [doi]
AB  - Premature ovarian failure (POF) is the occurrence of hypergonadotropic 
      hypoestrogenic amenorrhoea in women under the age of 40 years. POF is idiopathic in 
      74-90% of cases but can be familial (4-33%) or sporadic. The known causes are: 
      genetic aberrations; autoimmune ovarian damage; iatrogenic following surgery, 
      radiotherapy or chemotherapy; environmental factors (viruses, toxins, etc.); and 
      metabolic (galactosaemia, 17 OH deficiency, etc.) Genetic aberrations could involve 
      the X chromosome (monosomy, trisomy or translocations) or be autosomal. Genetic 
      mechanisms include reduced gene dosage and non-specific chromosome effect impairing 
      meiosis, decreasing the pool of primordial follicles and increasing atresia due to 
      apoptosis or failure of follicle maturation. The genes for POF-1 are localized to Xq 
      21.3-Xq27 and for POF-2 to Xq13.3-21.1. The FMR1 gene is responsible for the fragile 
      X syndrome. It occurs due to CGG expansion of more than 55 repeats at the 5'UTR (Xq 
      27.3), which is associated with gene silence resulting in mental retardation in 
      males, and POF in female carriers. Autoimmune ovarian damage is caused by the 
      alteration of T-cell subsets and T-cell-mediated injury, increase of autoantibody 
      producing B-cells and a low number of effector suppressor/cytotoxic lymphocyte and a 
      decrease of number and activity of natural killer cells. POF can be associated with 
      other non-endocrine and endocrine diseases. The mutations of AIRE gene are 
      responsible for polyendocrinopathies (APS I-III). As the cause of POF is unknown in 
      the majority of cases and the number of women with POF is increasing, the primary 
      goal of scientific groups worldwide should be focused on the study of the aetiology 
      of POF.

TI  - Second-trimester dimeric inhibin-A in Down's syndrome screening.
PG  - 1101-10
AB  - Initial studies of immunoreactive inhibin using a commercial assay have shown levels 
      to be increased in three second-trimester series of maternal samples from Down's 
      syndrome-affected pregnancies. This assay detected non-specifically all forms of 
      circulating inhibin, dimeric and free alpha subunits, whether fully or partially 
      processed. More recently, a new specific assay for dimeric inhibin-A has shown 
      elevated results in both a first-trimester and a second-trimester series of cases. 
      In order to assess the value of dimeric inhibin-A as a potential marker in the 
      second trimester, we have analysed 157 Down's syndrome cases and used 367 unaffected 
      cases across the gestational range 14-20 weeks to establish control medians and 
      population parameters. In our series, the median MOM in Down's cases was 1.77, 
      significantly higher than in the controls. At a 5 per cent false-positive rate, 
      dimeric inhibin-A alone identified 37 per cent of cases. When used in conjunction 
      with maternal age and other marker combinations, mathematical modelling showed 
      detection rates rising from 48 per cent (inhibin-A plus age) to 61 per cent 
      (inhibin-A, free beta hCG, age) and 68 per cent (inhibin-A, AFP, free beta hCG, 
      age). Our data suggest that dimeric inhibin-A may have greater potential earlier in 
      gestation when median levels at 14-16 weeks are 1.92 compared with 1.46 at 17-23 
      weeks. Dimeric inhibin-A may be a valuable addition to screening protocols, 
      particularly in early gestations.

TI  - ARID1B-Related Disorder.
BTI - GeneReviews(®)
AB  - CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: ARID1B-related disorder (ARID1B-RD) constitutes a clinical 
      continuum, from classic Coffin-Siris syndrome to intellectual disability with or 
      without nonspecific dysmorphic features. Coffin-Siris syndrome is classically 
      characterized by aplasia or hypoplasia of the distal phalanx or nail of the fifth 
      and additional digits, developmental or cognitive delay of varying degree, 
      distinctive facial features, hypotonia, hypertrichosis, and sparse scalp hair. 
      Frequencies of other features, such as developmental delay (with speech often more 
      affected than motor development), is consistent across the clinical spectrum, and 
      may include malformations of the cardiac, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and/or 
      central nervous systems. Other findings seen in individuals with ARID1B-RD include 
      feeding difficulties, slow growth, ophthalmologic abnormalities, hearing impairment, 
      seizures, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and autistic features. 
      DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of ARID1B-RD is established by identification of a 
      heterozygous pathogenic variant in ARID1B by molecular genetic testing. MANAGEMENT: 
      Treatment of manifestations: Standard treatment for strabismus, refractive error, 
      hearing loss, congenital heart defects, obstructive sleep apnea, constipation, 
      gastroesophageal reflux, cryptorchidism, scoliosis, and seizure disorders. For 
      significant feeding issues, a nasogastric and/or gastrostomy tube may be required. 
      Developmental therapies, including speech/language and feeding therapy, is 
      recommended for those with developmental delay. Surveillance: At least annual 
      assessment of developmental progress and educational needs; annual ophthalmology 
      evaluation and assessment for scoliosis (until growth is complete). Audiology 
      evaluation, behavior assessment, and hormonal evaluation/bone age as needed based on 
      symptoms. Those with seizures should be monitored as clinically indicated. GENETIC 
      COUNSELING: ARID1B-related disorder is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. 
      With the exception of two families in which a parent and child had features 
      consistent with ARID1B-related disorder, all individuals diagnosed to date have the 
      disorder as the result of a de novo pathogenic variant. Once the ARID1B pathogenic 
      variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal and 
      preimplantation genetic testing are possible.

TI  - Anti-gamma interferon can prevent the premature death of trisomy 16 mouse cortical 
      neurons in culture.
PG  - 17-20
AB  - Previous reports have indicated that human trisomy 21 and mouse trisomy 16 neurons 
      exhibit decreased viability in culture when compared to euploid control cultures and 
      that trisomic cells are significantly more sensitive to the anti-cellular effects of 
      the interferons. In the study reported here, cortical neurons from euploid and 
      trisomy 16 mouse fetuses were treated with either anti-gamma-interferon or 
      non-specific IgG and neuron morphology and viability measured photographically. The 
      addition of anti-gamma-interferon IgG to the culture media had no effect on euploid 
      neurons, but significantly increased trisomy neuron viability throughout the 5-day 
      culture period. Assay of both DNA fragmentation and phosphatidylserine 
      externalization suggested that the trisomic neurons were undergoing apoptosis at a 
      significantly higher rate than their euploid counterparts and that this increase in 
      apoptosis could be almost completely prevented by addition of either ligand purified 
      monoclonal or ligand purified polyclonal anti-gamma-interferon IgG. Taken together, 
      these data suggest that endogenous interferon plays an important role in the 
      premature death of the trisomy neuron.

TI  - Two Novel Mutations of ANKRD11 Gene and Wide Clinical Spectrum in KBG Syndrome: Case 
      Reports and Literature Review.
PG  - 579805
LID - 10.3389/fgene.2020.579805 [doi]
LID - 579805
AB  - BACKGROUND: KBG syndrome (OMIM #148050) is a rare, autosomal dominant inherited 
      genetic disorder caused by heterozygous mutations in the ankyrin repeat 
      domain-containing protein 11 (ANKRD11) gene or by microdeletion of chromosome 
      16q24.3. It is characterized by macrodontia of the upper central incisors, 
      distinctive facial dysmorphism, short stature, vertebral abnormalities, hand anomaly 
      including clinodactyly, and various degrees of developmental delay. KBG syndrome 
      presents with variable clinical feature and severity among individuals. Here, we 
      report two KBG patients who have different novel heterozygous mutations of ANKRD11 
      gene with wide range of clinical manifestations. CASE PRESENTATION: Two novel 
      heterozygous mutations of ANKRD11 gene were identified in two unrelated Korean 
      patients with variable clinical presentations. The first patient presented with 
      short stature and early puberty and was treated with growth hormone and 
      gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist without adverse effects. He had mild 
      intellectual disability. In targeted exome sequencing, a novel de novo frameshift 
      variant was identified in ANKRD11, c.5889del, and p. (Ile1963MetfsX9). The second 
      patient had severe intellectual disability with epilepsy. He had normal height and 
      prepubertal stage at the age of 11 years. He had behavioral problems such as 
      autism-like features, anxiety, and stereotypical movements. Whole exome sequencing 
      (WES) was performed, and the novel heterozygous mutation, c3310dup, p. 
      (Glu110GlyfsTer5) in ANKRD11 was identified. CONCLUSION: KBG syndrome is often 
      underdiagnosed because of its non-specific features and phenotypic variability. 
      Performing a next-generation sequencing panel, including the ANKRD11 gene for cases 
      of developmental delay with/without short stature may be helpful to identify 
      hitherto undiagnosed KBG syndrome patients.

TI  - Deletion including the oligophrenin-1 gene associated with enlarged cerebral 
      ventricles, cerebellar hypoplasia, seizures and ataxia.
PG  - 541-8
AB  - Non-specific X-linked mental retardation is a heterogeneous group of disorders with 
      an incidence of approximately 1 in 500 males. A recently identified gene in Xq12, 
      encoding a Rho-GTPase-activating protein, was found to be mutated in individuals 
      with mental retardation. We describe here two sisters with a 46,XY karyotype and a 
      microdeletion of the oligophrenin-1 gene and 1.1 Mb of flanking DNA. We have 
      characterised the molecular interval defining this microdeletion syndrome with the 
      fibre-FISH technique. A visual physical map of 1.2 Mb was constructed which spans 
      the oligophrenin-1 gene and the androgen receptor gene. The analysis of the patients 
      revealed a deletion which extended from the 5' end of the AR gene to a region 
      approximately 80 kb proximal to the EPLG2 gene. The clinical manifestations of the 
      two sisters include psychomotor retardation, seizures, ataxia, hypotonia and 
      complete androgen insensitivity. Cranial MRI scans show enlargement of the cerebral 
      ventricles and cerebellar hypoplasia. Our findings give further support for the 
      involvement of the oligophrenin-1 gene in specific morphological abnormalities of 
      the brain which is of importance in the investigation of male patients presenting 
      with mental retardation. In combination with our results from physical mapping we 
      suggest that a region around the oligophrenin-1 locus is relatively bereft of vital 
      genes.

TI  - MED12-Related Disorders.
BTI - GeneReviews(®)
AB  - CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: MED12-related disorders include the phenotypes of FG 
      syndrome type 1 (FGS1), Lujan syndrome (LS), X-linked Ohdo syndrome (XLOS), Hardikar 
      syndrome (HS), and nonspecific intellectual disability (NSID). FGS1 and LS share the 
      clinical findings of cognitive impairment, hypotonia, and abnormalities of the 
      corpus callosum. FGS1 is further characterized by absolute or relative macrocephaly, 
      tall forehead, downslanted palpebral fissures, small and simple ears, constipation 
      and/or anal anomalies, broad thumbs and halluces, and characteristic behavior. LS is 
      further characterized by large head, tall thin body habitus, long thin face, 
      prominent nasal bridge, high narrow palate, and short philtrum. Carrier females in 
      families with FGS1 and LS are typically unaffected. XLOS is characterized by 
      intellectual disability, blepharophimosis, and facial coarsening. HS has been 
      described in females with cleft lip and/or cleft palate, biliary and liver 
      anomalies, intestinal malrotation, pigmentary retinopathy, and coarctation of the 
      aorta. Developmental and cognitive concerns have not been reported in females with 
      HS. Pathogenic variants in MED12 have been reported in an increasing number of males 
      and females with NSID, with affected individuals often having clinical features 
      identified in other MED12-related disorders. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of an 
      MED12-related disorder is established in a male by identification of a hemizygous 
      MED12 pathogenic variant on molecular genetic testing. The diagnosis of an 
      MED12-related disorder is established in a female with suggestive findings and a 
      heterozygous pathogenic variant in MED12 identified by molecular genetic testing. 
      MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Early individualized education; physical 
      therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy for developmental delays; 
      individualized management of behavior problems; routine management of seizures, 
      strabismus and other ocular anomalies, imperforate anus, chronic constipation, joint 
      contractures, genitourinary anomalies, congenital heart defects, hearing loss, 
      palate anomalies, and dental anomalies; social work support. Treatment of aneurysms, 
      intestinal malrotation, and liver disease in females with HS as recommended by the 
      appropriate specialist. Surveillance: At each visit, assess growth, development, 
      behavior concerns, neurologic issues, gastrointestinal functioning, and 
      musculoskeletal manifestations. Annual eye examination with attention to retinal 
      changes for individuals with HS. Annual audiology evaluation. Dental evaluation 
      every six months, particularly for individuals with XLOS and LS. Females with HS 
      should have an annual echocardiogram, carotid ultrasound, gastroenterology 
      evaluation with liver function testing and consideration of clotting studies, serum 
      bile acids, and liver ultrasound based on recommendations of a gastroenterologist; 
      and MRA of the head and neck for aneurysms every two years. GENETIC COUNSELING: 
      MED12-related disorders are inherited in an X-linked manner. If the mother of a 
      proband is heterozygous for a pathogenic variant, the chance of transmitting it in 
      each pregnancy is 50%. Males who inherit the pathogenic variant will be affected. 
      Females who inherit a pathogenic variant associated with FGS1, LS, or XLOS will 
      typically be unaffected while females who inherit a pathogenic variant associated 
      with HS will typically be affected. Females who inherit a MED12 pathogenic variant 
      associated with NSID will be at an increased risk of developing variable clinical 
      features. Males with a MED12-related disorder are not known to reproduce. Once the 
      MED12 pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, 
      heterozygote testing for at-risk female relatives and prenatal and preimplantation 
      genetic testing for MED12-related disorders are possible.

TI  - An analysis of the regions of the myelin basic protein that bind to 
      phosphatidylcholine.
PG  - 777-83
AB  - The interactions of phosphatidylcholine (PC) to regions of the myelin basic protein 
      (MBP) was examined. In solid phase binding assays the nature of the binding of 
      unilamellar vesicles of 14C-labeled phosphatidylcholine to bovine 18.5 kDa MBP, its 
      N- and C-terminal peptide fragments, photooxidized 18.5 kDa MBP and the mouse 14 kDa 
      protein, with an internal deletion of residues 117-157, was studied. The data were 
      analyzed by computer-generated Scatchard plots in which non-specific binding was 
      eliminated. Non-cooperative, low affinity binding of PC vesicles to MBP was 
      observed, and this binding found to be sensitive to pH and ionic changes. At an 
      ionic strength of 0.1 and pH 7.4, the binding of PC to the 14 kDa mouse MBP 
      exhibited a Kd similar to that obtained with both the N-terminal and photooxidized 
      18.5 kDa bovine MBP. The studies indicated that the sites of PC interaction with MBP 
      are located in the N-terminal region of the protein. The C-terminal region appeared 
      to modulate the strength of the interaction slightly. Under similar conditions, 
      lysozyme did not bind PC liposomes, and histone bound them nonspecifically.

TI  - MECP2 Duplication Syndrome.
BTI - GeneReviews(®)
AB  - CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: MECP2 duplication syndrome is a severe neurodevelopmental 
      disorder characterized by early-onset hypotonia, feeding difficulty, 
      gastrointestinal manifestations including gastroesophageal reflux and constipation, 
      delayed psychomotor development leading to severe intellectual disability, poor 
      speech development, progressive spasticity, recurrent respiratory infections (in 
      ~75% of affected individuals), and seizures (in ~50%). MECP2 duplication syndrome is 
      100% penetrant in males. Occasionally females have been described with a MECP2 
      duplication and a range of findings from mild intellectual disability to a phenotype 
      similar to that seen in males. In addition to the core features, autistic behaviors, 
      nonspecific neuroradiologic findings on brain MRI, mottled skin, and urogenital 
      anomalies have been observed in several affected boys. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The 
      diagnosis of MECP2 duplication syndrome is established in an individual by 
      identification of a heterozygous whole-gene duplication of MECP2 on molecular 
      genetic testing. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Routine management of 
      feeding difficulties, constipation, developmental and speech delays, spasticity, and 
      seizures. Physical therapy to maintain range of motion to reduce likelihood of 
      contractures. Prompt antibiotic treatment for respiratory infections; all vaccines 
      should be given; consider gastrotomy tube if aspiration is present. Social work and 
      care coordination as indicated. Surveillance: Routine monitoring for growth, feeding 
      issues, constipation, reflux, loss of speech, progressive spasticity, seizure 
      disorder and response to anti-seizure medication, infections, and autistic-like 
      features. GENETIC COUNSELING: MECP2 duplication syndrome is inherited in an X-linked 
      manner. The majority of affected males have inherited the MECP2 duplication from a 
      heterozygous mother; however, de novo genetic alterations have been reported. If the 
      mother of the proband has a MECP2 duplication, the chance of transmitting it in each 
      pregnancy is 50%. Males who inherit the MECP2 duplication will be affected; females 
      who inherit the MECP2 duplication are typically asymptomatic but may exhibit 
      clinical manifestations ranging from mild nonspecific intellectual disability to a 
      severe phenotype similar to that observed in males. If the mother of the proband has 
      a balanced structural chromosome rearrangement involving the Xq28 region, the risk 
      to sibs depends on the specific chromosome rearrangement. Once the MECP2 duplication 
      has been identified in an affected family member (and/or the mother of the proband 
      is found to be a carrier of a balanced translocation), prenatal testing for a 
      pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.

AB  - The activity of nonspecific phosphomonoesterases in cerebellar structure of newborns 
      and infants with trisomies in the 13th (5 cases) 18th (4) and 21st (14) chromosomes 
      was investigated. In all trisomies, changes of phosphatase activity in the 
      cerebellar structures were demonstrated which were particularly marked with alkaline 
      phosphatase. The activity of this enzyme increased not only in the vascular 
      endothelium but in a number of cellular structures as well: in the external 
      embryonal and internal granular layers of the cortex, in the nuclei of Purkinje 
      cells and neurons of the nucleus dentatus, in the foci of heterotopia of cortical 
      cells into the white matter and nucleus dentatus. In Edwards' syndrome the activity 
      of alkaline phosphatase in cellular elements of the cerebellum was slightly higher 
      than in the control group. Changes in the activity was observed in the cells of the 
      external embryonal layer, neurons of the nucleus dentatus and in the cells of the 
      heterotopic foci. In autosomal trisomies dystopic cells have dissimilar levels of 
      phosphatase activity and stain mosaically which seems to confirm the assumption of 
      their dissimilar differentiation.

TI  - Huntingtin phosphorylation governs BDNF homeostasis and improves the phenotype of 
      Mecp2 knockout mice.

AB  - Mutations in the X-linked MECP2 gene are responsible for Rett syndrome (RTT), a 
      severe neurological disorder for which there is no treatment. Several studies have 
      linked the loss of MeCP2 function to alterations of brain-derived neurotrophic 
      factor (BDNF) levels, but non-specific overexpression of BDNF only partially 
      improves the phenotype of Mecp2-deficient mice. We and others have previously shown 
      that huntingtin (HTT) scaffolds molecular motor complexes, transports 
      BDNF-containing vesicles, and is under-expressed in Mecp2 knockout brains. Here, we 
      demonstrate that promoting HTT phosphorylation at Ser421, either by a 
      phospho-mimetic mutation or inhibition of the phosphatase calcineurin, restores 
      endogenous BDNF axonal transport in vitro in the corticostriatal pathway, increases 
      striatal BDNF availability and synaptic connectivity in vivo, and improves the 
      phenotype and the survival of Mecp2 knockout mice-even though treatments were 
      initiated only after the mice had already developed symptoms. Stimulation of 
      endogenous cellular pathways may thus be a promising approach for the treatment of 
      RTT patients.

TI  - Clinical and Genetic Characteristics of Splicing Variant in CYP27A1 in an Iranian 
      Family with Cerebrotendinous Xanthomatosis.
PG  - 132-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a rare congenital lipid-storage 
      disorder, leading to a progressive multisystem disease. CTX with autosomal recessive 
      inheritance is caused by a defect in the CYP27A1 gene. Chronic diarrhea, tendon 
      xanthomas, neurologic impairment, and bilateral cataracts are common symptoms of the 
      disease. METHODS: Three affected siblings with an initial diagnosis of non-syndromic 
      intellectual disability were recruited for further molecular investigations. To 
      identify the possible genetic cause(s), whole exome sequencing was performed on the 
      proband. Sanger sequencing was applied to confirm the final variant. The clinical 
      and molecular genetic features of the three siblings from the new CTX family and 
      other patients with the same mutations, as previously reported, were analyzed. The 
      CYP27A1 gene was also studied for the number of pathogenic variants and their 
      location. RESULTS: We found a homozygous splicing mutation, NM_000784: exon6: 
      c.1184+1G>A, in CYP27A1 gene, which was confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Among the 
      detected pathogenic variants, the splice site mutation had the highest prevalence, 
      and the mutations were mostly found in exon 4. CONCLUSION: This study is the first 
      to report the c.1184+1G>A mutation in Iran. Our findings highlight the other feature 
      of the disease, which is the lack of relationship between phenotype and genotype. 
      Due to nonspecific symptoms and delay in diagnosis, CYP27A1 genetic analysis should 
      be the definitive method for CTX diagnosis.

AB  - We describe the case of a seven-year-old female patient who presented in our service 
      with severe developmental delay, intellectual disability, facial dysmorphism, and 
      femur fracture, observed in the context of very low bone mineral density. 
      Array-based single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP array) analysis identified a 113 kb 
      duplication involving the morbid OMIM genes: ANKRD11 (exon1), RPL13, and PGN genes. 
      ANKRD11 deletions are frequently described in association with KBG syndrome, the 
      duplications being less frequent (one case described before). The exome sequencing 
      was negative for pathogenic variants or of uncertain significance in genes possibly 
      associated with this phenotype. The patient presented subtle signs of KBG syndrome. 
      It is known that the phenotype of KBG syndrome has a wide clinical spectrum, this 
      syndrome being often underdiagnosed due to overlapping features with other 
      conditions, also characterized by multiple congenital anomalies and intellectual 
      disability. The particularity of this case is represented by the very low bone 
      mineral density in a patient with 16q24.3 duplication. ANKRD11 haploinsufficiency is 
      known to be associated with skeletal involvement, such as short stature, or delayed 
      bone age. An effect on bone density has been observed only in experimental studies 
      on mice with induced missense mutations in the ANKRD11 gene. This CNV also involved 
      the duplication of the very conserved RPL13 gene, which could have a role for the 
      skeletal phenotype of this patient, knowing the high level of gene expression in 
      bone tissue and also the association with spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia Isidor 
      Toutain type, in case of splicing mutations.

TI  - Effects of Rett syndrome mutations of the methyl-CpG binding domain of the 
      transcriptional repressor MeCP2 on selectivity for association with methylated DNA.
PG  - 7100-6
AB  - We have investigated the properties of mutant forms of the methyl-CpG binding 
      transcriptional repressor MeCP2 associated with Rett syndrome, a childhood 
      neurodevelopmental disorder. We find that four Rett syndrome mutations at known 
      sites within the methyl-CpG binding domain (MBD) impair binding to methylated DNA, 
      but have little effect on nonspecific interactions with unmethylated DNA. Three of 
      these mutations (R106W, R133C, and F155S) have their binding affinities for 
      methylated DNA reduced more than 100-fold; this is consistent with the hypothesis 
      that impaired selectivity for methylated DNA of mutant MeCP2 contributes to Rett 
      syndrome. However, a fourth mutant, T158M, has its binding affinity for methylated 
      DNA reduced only 2-fold, indicative either of additional distinct regulatory 
      functions associated with the MBD or of an exquisite sensitivity of developing 
      neurons to the selective association of MeCP2 with methylated DNA.

TI  - Vitamin and mineral supplementation in Down's syndrome.
PG  - 707-13
AB  - The claim that large, nonspecific doses of vitamins and minerals improve the 
      performance of mentally retarded children has recently reappeared in both the 
      scientific literature and the public media. This hypothesis was examined in a 
      double-blind, case-control study involving 20 home-reared children with Down's 
      syndrome between 5 and 13 years of age. Children were randomly assigned by matched 
      pairs to either a vitamin/mineral group or placebo group for an 8-month study 
      period. No significant group differences or suggestive trends were found in any 
      tested area of development or behavior, including intelligence (IQ), school 
      achievement, speech and language, and neuromotor function. No group differences in 
      appearance, growth, or health were seen. No support was found for the orthomolecular

TI  - On BC1 RNA and the fragile X mental retardation protein.
PG  - 734-9
LID - 10.1073/pnas.0710991105 [doi]
AB  - The fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), the functional absence of which 
      causes fragile X syndrome, is an RNA-binding protein that has been implicated in the 
      regulation of local protein synthesis at the synapse. The mechanism of FMRP's 
      interaction with its target mRNAs, however, has remained controversial. In one 
      model, it has been proposed that BC1 RNA, a small non-protein-coding RNA that 
      localizes to synaptodendritic domains, operates as a requisite adaptor by 
      specifically binding to both FMRP and, via direct base-pairing, to FMRP target 
      mRNAs. Other models posit that FMRP interacts with its target mRNAs directly, i.e., 
      in a BC1-independent manner. Here five laboratories independently set out to test 
      the BC1-FMRP model. We report that specific BC1-FMRP interactions could be 
      documented neither in vitro nor in vivo. Interactions between BC1 RNA and FMRP 
      target mRNAs were determined to be of a nonspecific nature. Significantly, the 
      association of FMRP with bona fide target mRNAs was independent of the presence of 
      BC1 RNA in vivo. The combined experimental evidence is discordant with a proposed 
      scenario in which BC1 RNA acts as a bridge between FMRP and its target mRNAs and 
      rather supports a model in which BC1 RNA and FMRP are translational repressors that 
      operate independently.

AB  - We report on a 6-year-old boy referred for cytogenetics study. A few non-specific 
      features were observed in the newborn: hypotonia, failure to thrive, seizures, 
      pre-auricular skin tags. Cat-like cry was not identified. No remarkable facial 
      dysmorphism, gastrointestinal, respiratory or cardiac abnormalities were identified. 
      At age 4 years, speech and motor skill delays were apparent. Karyotyping and FISH 
      analysis revealed a de novo rearranged chromosome 5p, with subtelomeric deletion of 
      5p and a duplication of the cri-du-chat critical region. Array CGH using 
      sub-megabase resolution tiling-set (SMRT) array followed by FISH analysis with 
      labeled BACs showed a deletion of 5pter to 5p15.31 (0-6.9 Mb) and an inverted 
      duplication of the greater part of 5p15.31 to the distal end of 5p14.3 (6.9-19.9 
      Mb). Although very rare, inverted duplications with terminal deletion (inv dup del) 
      have been reported at different chromosomal ends. Our finding adds a second patient 
      of inv dup del 5p to this growing list, and the potential causative mechanisms for 
      this rearrangement are discussed. Review of the mapping information of cri-du-chat 
      patients and the comparison with a previously reported patient suggested that the 
      critical region for cat-like cry is located within a 0.6 Mb region.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: When hair accumulates inside the stomach, it causes what is called a 
      Trichobezoar, which leads to a stomach blockage. When the accumulated hair extends 
      into the small intestine, it causes a rare disturbance called Rapunzel syndrome 
      (RS). DISCUSSION: Affected patients infrequently remain asymptomatic for several 
      years. Symptoms begin while the bezoar increases in size to the point of 
      obstruction, these symptoms are nonspecific like vomiting, nausea, anorexia, 
      asymptomatic abdominal mass and digestive bleeding. PRESENTATION OF CASE: The 
      authors report an unusual case of a 25 years old young woman who presented with 
      acute abdominal pain and gastrointestinal symptoms. With an upper gastroscopy, the 
      condition was first diagnosed as a Trichobezoar that occupied the stomach. A 
      decision to perform a surgical procedure was taken, only to discover, during the 
      procedure, that the mass was extended to the duodenum and jejunum, thus diagnosing 
      the condition as Rapunzel syndrome. The patient was managed by surgical removal of 
      the huge mass. CONCLUSION: Trichobezoar considers as a differential diagnosis for 
      any patient with mental retardation and has gastrointestinal symptoms.

TI  - Different intracellular localization of peroxisomal proteins in fibroblasts from 
      patients with aberrant peroxisome assembly.
PG  - 1-8
AB  - We investigated intracellular localization of peroxisomal proteins in fibroblasts 
      from patients with Zellweger syndrome and neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy in whom 
      peroxisomes were morphologically deficient or severely decreased. Indirect 
      immunofluorescence staining revealed that catalase was mainly detected in the 
      cytosol of fibroblasts from these patients, but a small amount of catalase was 
      detected in granular pattern in a small percentage of cells. Double 
      immunofluorescence staining revealed that catalase-containing particles in these 
      patients also contained acyl-CoA oxidase and nonspecific lipid transfer protein. 
      However, a 70 kD integral membrane protein and 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase were detected 
      in all cells in granular pattern. Subcellular fractionation using digitonin after 
      cell labeling revealed that a small amount of acyl-CoA oxidase and about half of 
      thiolase in the precursor form were detected in the particulate fraction. These data 
      suggest that the mechanisms of the transport and processing of catalase, acyl-CoA 
      oxidase and nonspecific lipid transfer protein are different from those of the 70 kD 
      integral membrane protein and 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase.

PG  - 1-4
LID - 10.1080/13816810.2021.1989601 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: MED12-related disorders are a rare group of intellectual disability 
      syndromes with a broad range of phenotypic characteristics. The phenotypic spectrum 
      of MED12-related disorders currently includes X-Linked Ohdo Syndrome, Lujan-Fryns 
      Syndrome (LS), and FG syndrome type 1 (FG), also known as Opitz-Kaveggia Syndrome. 
      The MED12 gene encodes the largest component of the mediator complex of RNA 
      polymerase II, which is critical for recruiting activators and repressors to 
      regulate the transcription of genes critical to growth, development, and 
      differentiation. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature review of previously 
      published cases to highlight the key ocular features in individuals with 
      MED12-related disorders. In addition, we present a new case of a female patient with 
      a de novo pathogenic c. 3866A>G, p.Q1289R variant. Ocular manifestations are not 
      uncommon in MED12-related disorders, but have not been characterized in literature 
      reports. Commonly reoccurring reported eye and ocular adnexa features within the 
      spectrum include ptosis, downslanting palpebral fissures, and hypertelorism. Other 
      less common findings include strabismus, astigmatism, and optic nerve hypoplasia. 
      RESULTS: Our patient presented with developmental delay, mild hypotonia and 
      dysmorphic features including frontal bossing, high arched palate, and syndactyly of 
      the 2(nd) and 3(rd) toes bilaterally. DISCUSSION: Ocular manifestations identified 
      in this patient included intermittent esotropia, hyperopic astigmatism, epicanthal 
      folds and ptosis bilaterally.

TI  - Heat resistance, immunological and quantitative changes of neutrophil alkaline 
      phosphatase in trisomy 21 pregnancies.
PG  - 240-3
AB  - Neutrophil alkaline phosphatase (NAP) was analysed in 25 pregnant women with trisomy 
      21 foetuses whose chromosomal aberration was recognized by cytogenetic study after 
      amniocentesis. Enzyme investigation was performed at 20-22 weeks of gestation using 
      cytochemical and biochemical techniques. Twenty-nine women at the same stage of 
      normal pregnancies were selected as controls. In parallel, each mother was 
      karyotyped. Ten subjects from each series underwent biochemical and immunological 
      investigation: measurement of enzyme levels, thermostability study and immunological 
      tests with alkaline phosphatase isoenzyme antibodies. NAP from pregnant women with 
      trisomy 21 foetuses was characterized by: (1) a lower rate of enzyme activity, (2) a 
      large amount of heat-stable enzyme (T = 56 degrees C for biochemical assays, T = 85 
      degrees C for cytochemical tests), and (3) a marked loss of liver antigenicity. 
      These findings suggest the presence in trisomy 21 pregnancies of a non-specific 
      alkaline phosphatase isoenzyme which appears as an "enzyme marker" in maternal 
      circulating neutrophils.

TI  - Hepatitis C antibody testing: problems associated with non-specific binding.
PG  - 311-7
AB  - The prevalence of antibodies to hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV) was measured in a 
      number of groups known to be at increased risk of blood-borne viral infections, 
      using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (EIA) based on a nonstructural peptide 
      generated by recombinant DNA technology. The assay was repeatably reactive in 75.6% 
      of men with haemophilia, 61.9% of intravenous drug users, 34.1% of homosexual men 
      who were regular attenders at a gay sauna and 30.8% of prisoners. A lower reactivity 
      was detected in sera collected from female prostitutes (10.4%), patients undergoing 
      maintenance haemodialysis (5.9%), or renal transplantation (6.9%) and patients 
      attending a sexually transmitted diseases clinic (6.2%). We also measured reactivity 
      among inmates of a large institution for the mentally handicapped in which hepatitis 
      B is known to be endemic, and in panels of sera which had been stored for 25-35 
      years. The test was positive in 41.1% of mentally handicapped patients with Down's 
      syndrome and 7% of subjects with other forms of mental retardation. Similarly some 
      23% and 20% of sera collected in 1954 and 1964 from patients with a variety of 
      illnesses were found to be reactive. As most diagnostic assays suffer from some 
      degree of non-specificity and confirmatory tests for the anti-HCV assay were not 
      initially available in Australia, we analysed the distribution of optical density 
      (OD) values in the different groups, in an attempt to obtain an insight into the 
      specificity of the results being obtained. Whereas the ODs of sera collected from 
      patients with haemophilia and IVDU had a bimodal pattern, with two well separated 
      sets of results on either side of the cut-off.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - The first post-natal clinical description of true mosaic complete tetrasomy 21: A 
      case report.
PG  - 3507-3509
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.a.62471 [doi]
AB  - Tetrasomy 21 is a rare occurrence. Only 14 cases have been reported in the 
      literature, 8 of which are partial tetrasomy cases and 6 which are complete 
      tetrasomy cases. Of the incidences, no proband with true complete tetrasomy 21 has 
      survived the neonatal period. We report complete mosaic tetrasomy 21 in a female 
      infant with the typical Down syndrome phenotype, including Hirschsprung's disease 
      and atrioventricular (AV) canal defect. This is in contrast to cases of partial 
      tetrasomy 21, which often have an atypical trisomy 21 presentation and multiple 
      nonspecific traits, including short stature, microcephaly, and developmental delays. 
      This case demonstrates the difference in clinical presentation between the partial 
      and complete subtype of tetrasomy 21 and provides the first postnatal clinical 
      picture of an infant with true mosaic complete tetrasomy 21.

TI  - Investigating Reading Comprehension in Adolescents with Intellectual Disabilities: 
      Evaluating the Simple View of Reading.
PG  - 56
LID - 10.5334/joc.188 [doi]
LID - 56
AB  - Reading comprehension difficulties are common in individuals with intellectual 
      disabilities (ID), but the influences of underlying abilities related to reading 
      comprehension in this group have rarely been investigated. One aim of this study was 
      to investigate the Simple View of Reading as a theoretical framework to describe 
      cognitive and linguistic abilities predicting individual differences in reading 
      comprehension in adolescents with non-specific ID. A second aim was to investigate 
      whether predictors of listening comprehension and reading comprehension suggest that 
      individuals with ID have a delayed pattern of development (copying early grade 
      variance in reading comprehension) or a different pattern of development involving a 
      new or an unusual pattern of cognitive and linguistic predictors. A sample of 136 
      adolescents with non-specific ID was assessed on reading comprehension, decoding, 
      linguistic, and cognitive measures. The hypotheses were evaluated using structural 
      equation models. The results showed that the Simple View of Reading was not 
      applicable in explaining reading comprehension in this group, however, the 
      concurrent predictors of comprehension (vocabulary and phonological executive-loaded 
      working memory) followed a delayed profile.

TI  - Mosaic variegated aneuploidy without microcephaly: implications for cytogenetic 
      diagnosis.
PG  - 1890-3
AB  - Mosaic variegated aneuploidy (MVA) is a rare condition characterized by multiple 
      trisomies, rarely monosomies, and a non-specific phenotype including microcephaly, 
      growth and mental retardation, mild malformations, and an increased risk of 
      malignancy. We describe a patient with MVA in whom trisomy 19 mosaicism was 
      originally suspected. The patient was the product of an uncomplicated term pregnancy 
      and delivery. Significant findings were mental retardation, obesity, mild epicanthal 
      folds, tapering fingers, relatively small hands and feet, alternating exotropia, 
      nasal speech limited to short phrases, and generalized hypotonia. There is no family 
      history for birth defects, mental retardation, or consanguinity. The initial 
      peripheral blood chromosome study showed trisomy 19 in 4 of 31 metaphase cells. 
      Because mosaic trisomy 19 is rare, the study was extended to 100 cells, wherein two 
      cells with trisomy 8 were identified. A second blood karyotype was obtained and 
      found to be 47,XX,+8[3]/47,XX,+19[3]/47,XX, +18[2]/47,XX,+9[1]/46,XX[91]. Skin 
      fibroblast chromosome studies revealed a 46,XX karyotype in 120 cells examined. 
      There was no evidence of premature centromere separation. Mutations in the BUB1B 
      gene that encodes a key mitotic spindle checkpoint protein have been described in 
      MVA; however, no mutations of this gene were identified in our patient. This case 
      illustrates the importance of considering other possibilities when confronted with 
      an extremely rare diagnosis such as mosaic trisomy 19. In addition, it shows the 
      importance of not simply interpreting a low percentage of multiple aneuploidies as 
      cell culture artifact, because an additional work-up to rule out MVA may be 
      warranted since this diagnosis is associated with an increased risk of malignancy.

TI  - Multiplex PCR/liquid chromatography assay for screening of subtelomeric 
      rearrangements.
PG  - 241-8
AB  - In idiopathic or nonspecific mental retardation, the overall rate of cryptic 
      subtelomeric rearrangements is estimated to be about 5%. Development of 
      cost-effective screening for subtelomeric deletions would help clinical geneticists 
      to make specific diagnoses in children with idiopathic mental retardation. Current 
      screening modalities include fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using 
      subtelomeric probes and PCR-based quantitative analyses. Reductions in the cost and 
      turnaround time will make the complete screening of subtelomeric rearrangements more 
      widely used in clinical settings. Recently, a versatile method, called the multiplex 
      PCR/liquid chromatography assay (MP/LC), was developed to assess copy numbers in 
      this assay. Multiple genomic regions are amplified using unlabeled primers, then 
      separated by ion-pair reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. In the 
      present study, we developed an MP/LC-based subtelomeric screening system that 
      involves 21 multiple reactions and validated the protocol by analyzing 16 publicly 
      available cell lines with known cytogenetic abnormalities involving at least one 
      subtelomere per patient. To confirm the validity of the MP/LC method, we analyzed 
      these cell lines concurrently with array-based comparative genomic hybridization 
      (array-CGH), which gives higher resolution than the conventional G-banding 
      technique. Among those 16 samples, the results from MP/LC and array-CGH agreed with 
      each other perfectly. In 2 of the 16 samples, MP/LC correctly revealed subtelomeric 
      duplications that were detected by array-CGH but were undetected by conventional 
      cytogenetics, demonstrating the sensitivity of the MP/LC assay. This system is 
      expected to be useful for making specific diagnoses and in genetic counseling for 
      children with idiopathic mental retardation, a sizable fraction of whom have 
      subtelomeric rearrangements.

TI  - Immunological patterns in young children with Down syndrome: is there a temporal 
      trend?
PG  - 1479-82
AB  - Down syndrome is associated with an increased susceptibility to infections due to a 
      deficiency of both specific and nonspecific immunity. AIM: The aim of the study was 
      to analyze the temporal trends, if any, of some variables related to the 
      immunological status of children affected by Down syndrome. METHODS: Heparinized 
      blood samples were obtained by venipuncture in 30 children with Down syndrome, who 
      were regularly followed in our department and analyzed for hematologic values, 
      lymphocyte subpopulations, immunoglobulin dosage and zinc level. Results were 
      compared with those of the normal population. RESULTS: In the first 5 years of life, 
      we observed a progressive decrease in the medium values of lymphocytes, CD4(+) and 
      plasma zinc levels, and an increase in CD8(+), immunoglobulin A, immunoglobulin G, 
      immunoglobulin M and natural killer, but generally without exceeding the interval of 
      normality. CONCLUSIONS: In Down syndrome children, the immune cellular status is 
      similar to the normal population as far as white blood cell, lymphocyte, CD4(+), 
      CD8(+), natural killer and immunoglobulins are concerned. Plasma level of zinc is 
      normal from birth until 5 years but with a temporal trend of progressive reduction. 
      This observation supports the hypothesis that a pharmacological supplementation may 
      be necessary in Down syndrome children only after 5 years of age.

TI  - Long-term persistence of intrathecal viral antibody responses in postinfectious 
      diseases of the central nervous system and in Rett syndrome.
PG  - 215-9
AB  - Twenty patients: seven with herpes simplex virus encephalitis (HSVE), six with other 
      severe central nervous system (CNS) infections and 7 with Rett syndrome were studied 
      to determine whether they showed any intrathecal synthesis of virus-specific or 
      total IgG in CNS. The study of the postinfectious patients was made a mean of 20 
      years after the primary infection in childhood. Four of seven patients with HSVE had 
      an elevated IgG index and four showed intrathecal viral antibody production which 
      was both specific (against HSV) and non-specific. One patient with congenital 
      syphilis and one with tuberculotic meningitis showed non-specific intrathecal viral 
      antibody synthesis. In three of seven patients with Rett syndrome intrathecal 
      antibody production was observed. The clarification of the mechanism of polyclonal 
      immunoactivation in postinfectious diseases would be of interest since similar 
      persistent immunoactivation is a common feature in multiple sclerosis. In Rett 
      syndrome the immunoactivation may also have pathogenetic significance.

AB  - The cerebellar cortices in two patients with X-chromosome-linked copper 
      malabsorption (Menkes kinky-hair disease) were examined with both the light and 
      electron microscope. Somatic sprouts and grotesque dendritic arborization were among 
      the obvious light microscopical changes. At the fine structural level, the Purkinje 
      cells were characterized by the presence of somatic spines although the surviving 
      granule cells had already descended. Most spines were parts of synaptic complexes, 
      but some were unattached to any presynaptic element. Similar spines were also 
      observed on dendritic trunks. Astrocytic gliosis and nonspecific endothelial cell 
      changes were noted.

TI  - Positional mapping of specific DNA sequences relative to the nuclear substructure by 
      direct polymerase chain reaction on nuclear matrix-bound templates.
PG  - 196-207
AB  - Nuclear DNA of higher eukaryotes is organized in supercoiled loops anchored to a 
      proteinaceous substructure commonly known as the nuclear matrix. Current evidence 
      suggests that important processes of nuclear physiology, such as replication, 
      transcription, and processing of primary transcripts, take place at macromolecular 
      complexes located at discrete, well-defined sites upon the nuclear matrix. A number 
      of authors have reported that actively transcribed genes are closely associated with 
      the nuclear matrix. The topological relationship between the gene sequences located 
      in the DNA loops and the nuclear matrix appears to be very important for appropriate 
      nuclear physiology. Here, we describe a polymerase chain reaction-based method for 
      directly mapping any DNA sequence position relative to the nuclear matrix that 
      avoids the problem posed by DNA fragments nonspecifically bound to the nuclear 
      matrix, without the need of purifying the specifically nuclear matrix-bound DNA.

      interpretation of computed tomography images. The indications for cranial CT are 
      discussed in respect probable therapeutic consequences and expected diagnostic

      headache, generalised epileptic convulsions, non-specific mental retardation and 
      cerebral palsy.

AB  - TCF4 gene (18q21.1) encodes for a transcription factor with multiple isoforms 
      playing a critical role during neurodevelopment. Molecular alterations of this gene 
      are associated with Pitt-Hopkins syndrome, a severe condition characterized by 
      intellectual disability, specific facial features and autonomic nervous system 
      dysfunction. We report here three patients presenting with structural variations of 
      the proximal part of TCF4 associated with a mild phenotype. The first patient is a 
      six-years-old girl carrier of a pericentric inversion of chromosome 18, 
      46,XX,inv(18)(p11.2q21.1). Whole genome sequencing (WGS) characterized the 
      breakpoint at the base-pair level at chr18:1262334_1262336 and 
      chr18:53254747_53254751 (hg19). This latter breakpoint disrupted the proximal 
      promotor region of TCF4 in the first intron of the gene. The second and third 
      patients are a son and his mother, carrier of a 46 kb deletion characterized by 
      high-resolution chromosomal micro-array and WGS (chr:18:53243454_53287927, hg19) 
      encompassing the first three exon of TCF4 gene and including the proximal promotor 
      region. Expression studies on blood lymphocytes in these patients showed a marked 
      decrease of mRNA level for long isoforms of TCF4 and an increased level for shorter 
      isoforms. The patients described here, together with previously reported patients 
      with proximal structural alterations of TCF4, help to delineate a phenotype of mild 
      ID with non-specific facial dysmorphism without characteristic features of PTHS. It 
      also suggests a gradient of phenotypic severity inversely correlated with the number 
      of intact TCF4 promotor regions, with expression of short isoforms compensating in 
      part the loss of longer isoforms.

TI  - [Infantile form of Hallervorden-Spatz disease (author's transl)].
PG  - 257-66
AB  - The authors report the evolution since birth of a third patient belonging to a 
      sibship affected by the infantile form of Hallervorden-Spatz disease. The diagnosis 
      has been histologically proven in each case. Due to a lack of full clinical reports 
      in the available literature, the emphasis has mainly been placed on the complex 
      extrapyramidal syndrome characteristic of this disorder and illustrated by our own 
      cases. We stree here the occurrence of extrapyramidal fits with exceptionally severe 
      hemiballic movements and torsion spasms. Moreover the clinical signs and their 
      succession in time are strikingly similar in our three patients. Our main purpose is 
      to document accurately the early stages of this disorder; they are characterized by 
      a non-specific spastic diplegia associated with mental retardation. There is a 
      progressive but incomplete improvement during the following years. Thereafter the 
      extrapyramidal syndrome appears. It is to early to decide whether all the infantile 
      cases of Hallervorden-Spatz disease do indeed present a diphasic evoluation because 
      our third patient is the only one to have been followed up since birth; relevant 
      data are scarcely available in the other reported cases. On the other hand, it is 
      correct to state that a spastic diplegia with mental retardation under the age of 
      two--provided a perinatal anoxic excephalopathy has been ruled out--can lead to a 
      wide range of conditions from normality to a neurological disorder as severe as the 
      one reported here.

LID - 10.1203/PDR.0b013e3181b1bd6a [doi]
AB  - Subjects attending full-time special education (SE) often have multifactorial 
      background for their cognitive impairment, and brain MRI may show nonspecific 
      changes. As voxel-based morphometry reveals regional volume differences, we applied 
      this method to 119 subjects with cognitive impairments and familial need for 
      full-time SE--graded into three levels from specific disorders of cognitive 
      processes (level 1) to intellectual disability (IQ <70; level 3)--and to 43 
      age-matched controls attending mainstream education (level 0). Subjects in SE groups 
      had smaller global brain white matter (WM), cerebrospinal fluid, and total brain 
      volume than controls. Compared with controls, subjects with intellectual 
      disabilities in SE level 3 showed greater regional gray matter volumes bilaterally 
      in the ventral and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and smaller regional gray matter 
      volumes in the left thalamus and cerebellar hemisphere. Further, they had greater WM 
      volume in the left frontoparietal region and smaller WM volumes in the posterior 
      limbs of the internal capsules. Subjects in SE level 1 and 2 groups showed the same 
      tendency, but the results were nonsignificant. In conclusion, compared with 
      controls, subjects with intellectual disabilities showed in voxel-based morphometry 
      analysis several regional brain alterations.

TI  - T cell response to anti-CD3 antibody in Down's syndrome.
PG  - 1148-51
AB  - The non-specific mitogen phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) and an anti-CD3 (OKT3) monoclonal 
      antibody were used to measure the lymphocyte proliferative response in blood samples 
      from 15 subjects with Down's syndrome. Blood from 15 healthy controls closely 
      matched for age and sex was also assayed. The mean blastogenic value in PHA 
      stimulated patient lymphocyte cultures was similar to that calculated in the 
      controls. In contrast, the mitogenic response of lymphocytes from patients with 
      Down's syndrome to anti-CD3 stimulation was on average significantly reduced. 
      Immunofluorescence studies and additional experiments carried out by using 
      semiallogeneic (maternal) monocytes as a source of antigen presenting cells showed 
      that the impaired anti-CD3 induced mitogenesis in Down's syndrome could not be 
      ascribed either to a lack of binding of the antibody to the trisomic cells, or to a 
      defective monocyte-T cell interaction. These findings help to explain the cellular 
      basis of the immune defect in Down's syndrome.

      Malformation-Case Report With Literature Review.
PG  - 270

LID - 270
AB  - 3q29 deletion syndrome is a rare disorder, causing a complex phenotype. Clinical 
      features are variable and relatively non-specific. Our report aims to present an 
      atypical, de novo deletion in chromosome band 3q29 in a preschool boy, first child 
      of healthy non-consanguineous parents, presenting a particular phenotype 
      (microcephaly, "full moon" face, flattened facial profile, large ears, auricular 
      polyp, and dental dystrophies), motor and cognitive delay, characteristics of autism 
      spectrum disorder and aggressive behavior. He also presented intrauterine growth 
      restriction (birth weight 2,400 g) and a ventricular septal defect. SNP Array 
      revealed a 962 kb copy number loss, on the chromosome 3q29 band 
      (195519857-196482211), consistent with 3q29 microdeletion syndrome. FISH analysis 
      using a RP11-252K11 probe confirmed the deletion in the proband, which was not 
      present in the parents. Although the patient's deletion is relatively small, it 
      partly overlaps the canonical 3q29 deletion (defined between TFRC and DLG1 gene) and 
      extends upstream, associating a different facial phenotype compared to the classic 
      3q29 deletion, nonetheless showing a similar psychiatric disorder. This deletion is 
      different from the canonical region, as it does not include the PAK2 and DLG1 genes, 
      considered as candidates for causing intellectual disability. Thus, narrowing the 
      genotype-phenotype correlation for the 3q29 band, FBX045 is suggested as a candidate 
      gene for the neuropsychiatric phenotype.

AB  - Distal chromosome 22q11.2 microduplications are associated with a wide range of 
      phenotypes and unclear pathogenicity. The authors report on a 3-year-old girl with 
      global developmental delay harboring a de novo 1.24 Mb distal chromosome 22q11.2 
      microduplication and a paternally inherited 0.25 Mb chromosome 4p14 
      microduplication. The authors review clinical features of 30 reported cases of 
      distal 22q11.2 duplications. Common features include developmental delay (93%), 
      neuropsychiatric features (26%), and nonspecific facial dysmorphisms (74%). In 70% 
      of cases, the distal 22q11.2 duplications were inherited, and the majority of the 
      carrier parents were phenotypically normal. Furthermore, 30% of probands carried an 
      additional copy number variant. Review of the phenotype in individuals carrying 
      microduplications involving similar low copy repeats (LCR) failed to establish any 
      clear genotype-phenotype correlations. Distal 22q11.2 duplications represent a major 
      challenge for genetic counseling and prediction of clinical consequences. Our report 
      suggests a pathogenic role of distal 22q11.2 duplications and supports a "multiple 
      hit" hypothesis underlying its variable expressivity and phenotypic severity.

TI  - [Norrie syndrome (author's transl)].
PG  - 562-7
AB  - The Norrie syndrome, an x-chromosomal linked, recessive genetic disease, is 
      described using ophthalmologic and genetic examinations of a family in three 
      generations. The main symptom of this syndrome is retinal detachment with 
      hemorrhages, which generally leads to blindness in early childhood. In addition to 
      this, in 25--35% of the cases mental retardation and hearing problems are found. 
      Special significance is to be attached to the differential diagnosis of this 
      syndrome because the vascular proliferation on the retina is a non-specific, 
      secondary reaction in children, which also occurs symptomatically in several other 
      diseases.

TI  - Prophylaxis with the novel immunomodulator pidotimod reduces the frequency and 
      severity of upper respiratory tract infections in children with Down's syndrome.
PG  - 126-30
AB  - Down's syndrome (DS) is associated with several defects of both specific and 
      non-specific immunity which may explain the enhanced susceptibility of DS subjects 
      to viral and bacterial infections. In this study we have evaluated the effects of 
      the new synthetic immunomodulator pidotimod in recurrent infections of the upper 
      respiratory tract in a group of children with DS. It was an open trial vs untreated 
      control, the pidotimod-treated group consisted of 14 subjects and the control group 
      of 12. Pidotimod was administered at the dose of one 400 mg oral bottle/day for 90 
      days. There was a significant reduction in the frequency, severity and duration of 
      infectious episodes in the pidotimod-treated group vs the untreated control group. 
      The beneficial effects of pidotimod were also confirmed by a series of recordings 
      made over the 90-day treatment period which showed a significant reduction in the 
      number of days of fever, severity of the signs and symptoms of the acute episodes 
      and use of antibiotics and antipyretic drugs. Pidotimod was well tolerated and no 
      clinical, hematological or biochemical side-effects were noted.

TI  - Diet, genetics, and mental retardation interaction between phenylketonuric 
      heterozygous mother and fetus to produce nonspecific diminution of IQ: evidence in 
      support of the justification hypothesis.
PG  - 1562-6
AB  - The justification hypothesis postulates that an individual genetically deficient in 
      the synthesis of any of the 12 nonessential amino acids requires that amino acid in 
      the diet just as a normal individual requires any essential amino acid. The 
      deficiency of that single amino acid causes diminished protein synthesis. The 
      hypothesis proposes that mental retardation develops during the late stage of fetal 
      development, when the brain is growing most rapidly, as a result of the inability of 
      the mother to deliver an appropriate amount of that nonessential amino acid to her 
      fetus who, in turn, is unable to correct for this deficiency due to his genetic 
      constitution. A paradigm is provided by the disease phenylketonuria in which the 
      homozygote lacks the enzyme for synthesis of the nonessential amino acid tyrosine. 
      By measuring the appearance of tyrosine in the plasma after an oral dose of 
      phenylalanine, it is possible to show differential capability among siblings of 
      known phenylketonuric children, in the expected Mendelian ratio. The mean IQ of the 
      two-thirds of the siblings who were least able to convert phenylalanine to tyrosine 
      (presumably heterozygotes) was 10 points lower than the mean IQ of the "normals," 
      who were most able to synthesize tyrosine. The difference is statistically 
      significant (P <0.01). The mean maternal IQ was halfway between that of the 
      heterozygote group and that of the normal group, confirming the prediction of 
      maternal-fetal interaction.

TI  - Diagnosis and long-term course of Dravet syndrome.
PG  - S5-8
LID - 10.1016/j.ejpn.2012.04.007 [doi]
AB  - Dravet syndrome is a severe infantile-onset epilepsy syndrome with a distinctive but 
      complex electroclinical presentation. A healthy, developmentally normal infant 
      presents at around 6 months of age with convulsive status epilepticus, which may be 
      hemiclonic or generalized; seizures may be triggered by fever, illness or 
      vaccination. The infant typically has further episodes of status epilepticus every 
      month or two, often triggered by fever. Other seizure types including focal 
      dyscognitive seizures, absence and myoclonic seizures develop between 1 and 4 years. 
      Atonic drop attacks and episodes of non-convulsive status may occur. Early 
      development is normal but slows in the second year. Developmental regression may 
      occur, particularly with status epilepticus. EEG studies are initially normal, but 
      after 2 years they show generalized spike-wave and polyspike-wave activity with 
      multifocal discharges. Photosensitivity may be seen. Imaging is normal or shows 
      non-specific findings such as atrophy. Dravet syndrome is associated with mutations 
      of the gene encoding the alpha-1 subunit of the sodium channel, SCN1A, in >70% of 
      patients. These include sequencing mutations and copy number variant anomalies; 90% 
      of mutations arise de novo. PCDH19 mutational analysis is a second-tier test for 
      girls with a Dravet-like picture who do not have SCN1A mutations. Outcome is poor, 
      with intellectual disability in most patients and ongoing seizures. Intellectual 
      impairment varies from severe in 50% patients, to moderate and mild intellectual 
      disability each accounting for 25% cases. Rare patients have normal intellect. The 
      long-term course involves ongoing, brief nocturnal convulsions and a characteristic 
      deterioration in gait.

PG  - 333-7
AB  - A 31 years old man with history of familial psychiatric disorder was investigated. 
      Chromosomal analysis in peripheral lymphocyte blood culture showed normal karyotype 
      with 46, XY chromosomal complement. However, the cells treated with 
      5-Fluoro-deoxy-uridine (FUdR) and Caffeine showed fragile Xq-27 (4.0%) and 
      nonspecific autosomal breakages (42.0%). The present case suggests a probable 
      association between chromosomal fragility and non-mental retardation 
      psychopathology. Further cytogenetic studies in cases with familial psychiatric 
      disorders will enable us with a better understanding of the pathogenesis and further 
      help in counselling the families.

TI  - Atypical Angelman syndrome due to a mosaic imprinting defect: Case reports and 
      review of the literature.
PG  - 753-757
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.a.38072 [doi]
AB  - Angelman syndrome (AS) is characterized by severe intellectual disability, limited, 
      or absent speech and a generally happy demeanor. The four known etiological 
      mechanisms; deletions, uniparental disomy, imprinting defects, and UBE3A mutation 
      all affect expression of the UBE3A gene at 15q11-q13. An atypical phenotype is seen 
      in individuals who are mosaic for a chromosome 15q11-q13 imprinting defect on the 
      maternal allele. These patients present with a milder phenotype, often with 
      hyperphagia and obesity or non-specific intellectual disability. Unlike typical AS 
      syndrome, they can have a vocabulary up to 100 words and speak in sentences. Ataxia 
      and seizures may not be present, and the majority of individuals do not have 
      microcephaly. Here we review the current literature and present three individuals 
      with atypical AS caused by a mosaic imprinting defect to demonstrate why DNA 
      methylation analysis at the SNRPN locus needs to be considered in a broader clinical 
      context. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - Genetic testing in pediatric endocrine pathology.
PG  - S15-S18
LID - 10.15386/mpr-2220 [doi]
AB  - In genetic endocrine diseases, genetic testing is necessary for a precise diagnosis, 
      which will provide a better knowledge of the evolution and prognosis and also 
      indicate the adequate therapy, targeting the precise etiopathogenesis of the 
      disease. Genetic testing in endocrinology is often based on classical cytogenetic 
      techniques, molecular cytogenetic analysis or molecular biology techniques. Genetic 
      testing in disorders of sex development includes the karyotype and SRY gene analysis 
      and depending on the presence of associated clinical signs and on the observations 
      at paraclinical examination, these tests will be followed by chromosomal array 
      techniques and NGS sequencing. In short stature, the decision to perform a genetic 
      test is taken depending on clinical, paraclinical and imaging signs. In case of a 
      short stature associated with a low weight/length for gestational age, genetic 
      testing is proposed to evaluate a Russell-Silver syndrome or if the short stature is 
      associated with other clinical signs (e.g. intellectual disability), chromosomal 
      analysis by microarray is proposed. If the short stature is disproportionate, it is 
      indicated to perform a next generation sequencing (NGS) of a panel of genes involved 
      in skeletal dysplasia. If an endocrine cause for short stature is observed at the 
      hormonal evaluation, it is indicated to test a panel of genes involved in these 
      pathways. In genetic obesity, depending on clinical signs associated to obesity, it 
      will be a more targeted genetic testing. If obesity is associated with intellectual 
      disability or other nonspecific neurological changes, a chromosomal analysis by 
      microarray will be indicated. If monogenic obesity is suspected, NGS testing will be 
      indicated (as genes panel or whole exome or genome analysis). Genetic testing in 
      endocrine diseases brings an etiological diagnosis, but a favorable cost-benefit 
      ratio derives from an adequate indication of these tests, generally proposed in 
      expert centers for rare endocrine diseases.

TI  - Peroxisomal disorders: genotype, phenotype, major neuropathologic lesions, and 
      pathogenesis.
PG  - 101-20
AB  - Neurological dysfunction is a prominent feature of most peroxisomal disorders. 
      Enormous progress in defining their gene defects has been achieved. The genes and 
      gene products, peroxins (PEX), in five of the complementation groups have been 
      defined. These studies confirm that Zellweger syndrome (ZS), neonatal 
      adrenoleukodystrophy (NALD), and infantile Refsum disease (IRD) are a disease 
      continuum. The gene defect in adreno-leukodystrophy (ALD) / adrenomyeloneuropathy 
      (AMN) involves an integral peroxisomal membrane protein. Neuropathologic lesions are 
      of three major classes: (i) abnormalities in neuronal migration or differentiation, 
      (ii) defects in the formation or maintenance of central white matter, and (iii) 
      postdevelopmental neuronal degenerations. The central white matter lesions are those 
      of: (i) inflammatory demyelination, (ii) non-inflammatory dysmyelination, and (iii) 
      non-specific reductions in myelin volume or staining with or without reactive 
      astrocytosis. The neuronal degenerations are of two major types: (i) the axonopathy 
      of AMN involving ascending and descending tracts of the spinal cord, and (ii) 
      cerebellar atrophy in rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata and probably IRD. We 
      postulate that the abnormal fatty acids in peroxisomal disorders, particularly very 
      long chain fatty acids and phytanic acid, are incorporated into cell membranes and 
      perturb their microenvironments resulting in dysfunction, atrophy and death of 
      vulnerable cells. The advent of mouse models for ZS and ALD is anticipated to 
      provide even greater pathogenetic insights into the peroxisomal disorders.

      symptoms. Early-onset childhood dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy involved mental 
      retardation, whereas myoclonic epilepsy was the predominant complaint in later-onset 
      childhood version of the disease. Aspiration pneumonia was common in the late stage 
      of disease. Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy is an autosomal dominant condition 
      attributed to CAG trinucleotide repeats in the dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy 
      gene. The four children in this series had 63 to 79 CAG repeats. The expanded allele 
      was inherited from the father in both families. One father had 54 CAG repeats and 
      was asymptomatic; the other had 66 repeats and had an unsteady gait. Because the 
      radiological, electroencephalographic, and electrophysiological findings were 
      non-specific, we suggest that DRPLA gene testing should be performed in any child 
      presenting with a variable combination of myoclonic epilepsy, mental retardation or 
      developmental regression, and ataxochoreo-athetosis.

TI  - A simple and rapid analysis of triplet repeat diseases by expand long PCR.
PG  - 1259-62
AB  - It is now known that 15 monogenic, mostly neurological, disorders are caused by the 
      same type of mutations that occur in trinucleotide repeat sequences in certain 
      genes. Since they share a nonspecific and variable phenotype, the accurate diagnosis 
      could be made only by DNA analysis. We developed an Expand Long PCR assay that 
      provides more reliable molecular diagnosis of such disorders. Its main 
      characteristics are robust amplification of expanded alleles, simplicity, low cost 
      and speed. We suggest the use of Expand Long PCR for routine molecular diagnosis of 
      triplet repeat diseases, and present such analysis of the fragile X syndrome, 
      myotonic dystrophy and Huntington's disease.

PG  - 339-66
LID - 10.1007/s11065-008-9075-9 [doi]
AB  - Although Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are generally assumed to be lifelong, we 
      review evidence that between 3% and 25% of children reportedly lose their ASD 
      diagnosis and enter the normal range of cognitive, adaptive and social skills. 
      Predictors of recovery include relatively high intelligence, receptive language, 
      verbal and motor imitation, and motor development, but not overall symptom severity. 
      Earlier age of diagnosis and treatment, and a diagnosis of Pervasive Developmental 
      Disorder-Not Otherwise Specified are also favorable signs. The presence of seizures, 
      mental retardation and genetic syndromes are unfavorable signs, whereas head growth 
      does not predict outcome. Controlled studies that report the most recovery came 
      about after the use of behavioral techniques. Residual vulnerabilities affect 
      higher-order communication and attention. Tics, depression and phobias are frequent 
      residual co-morbidities after recovery. Possible mechanisms of recovery include: 
      normalizing input by forcing attention outward or enriching the environment; 
      promoting the reinforcement value of social stimuli; preventing interfering 
      behaviors; mass practice of weak skills; reducing stress and stabilizing arousal. 
      Improving nutrition and sleep quality is non-specifically beneficial.

TI  - Menkes' disease and swayback. A comparative study of two copper deficiency 
      syndromes.
PG  - 95-113
AB  - The neuropathological findings in two siblings with Menkes' disease were compared 
      with representative material obtained from lambs suffering from swayback (enzootic 
      ataxia). The aim of the study was to demonstrate the similarity of lesions in a 
      genetic and a nutritional form of copper deficiency in support of the view that all 
      lesions in Menkes' disease could be ascribed to simple hypocupraemia. All lesions of 
      Menkes' disease were shown to have their counterpart in swayback, with exception of 
      the abnormal arborisations of the Purkinje cell dendrites. These have often been 
      interpreted as malformations and cited in evidence of the prenatal origin of the 
      cerebral lesions. They are, however, non-specific and similar lesions have been 
      reported in conditions arising in later life. While there is abundant collateral 
      evidence of disturbed copper metabolism in utero, the problem of the prenatal versus 
      postnatal origin of cerebral damage remains unresolved.

TI  - Paternally derived de novo interstitial duplication of proximal 15q in a patient 
      with developmental delay.
PG  - 294-300
AB  - Interstitial duplications of proximal 15q containing the Prader-Willi 
      syndrome/Angelman syndrome (PWS/AS) region have been found in patients with autism 
      or atypical autism. In these cases with an abnormal phenotype, the duplications were 
      maternally derived. Paternal origin of the duplication has been associated with a 
      normal phenotype. We report on a patient who presented with nonspecific 
      developmental delay and partial agenesis of the rostral corpus callosum. 
      Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) studies using probes specific for the 
      PWS/AS region demonstrated a double signal on one chromosome 15, indicating the 
      presence of an interstitial duplication of proximal 15q involving the PWS/ AS region 
      in the patient. Parental chromosomes were normal with FISH studies. Methylation 
      analysis at exon alpha of the SNRPN locus showed a maternal band at 4.2 kb and a 
      paternal band of apparent double intensity at 0.9 kb, suggestive of one copy of the 
      maternal allele and two copies of the paternal allele in the patient. Microsatellite 
      analysis was informative at the GABRB3 locus in the family, which showed the 
      inheritance of two different paternal alleles and a maternal allele in the patient 
      consistent with the origin of this duplication from an unequal crossing over between 
      the two chromosome 15 homologs in the father. This is the first report of an 
      abnormal phenotype associated with a paternally derived duplication of proximal 15q 
      shown to contain the PWS/AS region by molecular techniques.

TI  - Optimized spectrophotometric assay for the completely activated pyruvate 
      dehydrogenase complex in fibroblasts.
PG  - 151-60
AB  - BACKGROUND: Analysis of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHc) activity in human 
      skin fibroblasts is hampered by low enzyme activity in the cells. The most commonly 
      used radiochemical method detects the formation of (14)CO(2), an endproduct of the 
      E1 component of PDHc, from [1-(14)C]pyruvate. METHODS: We report a 
      spectrophotometric method for the analysis of PDHc activity in fibroblasts based on 
      detection of NADH formation via a p-iodonitrotetrazolium violet (INT)-coupled 
      system. We investigated in detail the specific requirements of this assay, such as 
      cofactor requirements and the effects of suggested stimulatory compounds and 
      different cell disruption procedures. The reliability of the optimized assay was 
      studied by investigation of patients previously diagnosed with PDHc deficiency and 
      by comparison with results from the radiochemical method. RESULTS: Mean (SD) total 
      PDHc activities were 136 (31) and 58 (21) mU/U of citrate synthase in fibroblast 
      homogenates from 10 healthy volunteers and 7 PDHc-deficient patients, respectively, 
      by the spectrophotometric assay. Similar results were obtained in a mitochondrial 
      fraction. Dithiothreitol (DTT) increased the nonspecific inhibitor-insensitive rate 
      with less pronounced effect on the specific rate of PDHc activity. Administration of 
      DTT increased PDHc activity to 193 (3)% of control activity (without DTT), but 
      decreased the inhibitor-sensitive rate from 99 (0.3)% (without DTT) to 69 (2)% (with 
      0.3 mmol/L DTT). CONCLUSION: The simple, optimized spectrophotometric assay for PDHc 
      analysis allows reliable investigation of the enzyme complex in human skin 
      fibroblasts.

AB  - Troyer syndrome is an autosomal recessive form of complex hereditary spastic 
      paraplegia. To date, the disorder has only been described in the Amish and in 
      kindred from Oman. In Amish, all affected individuals have a homozygous one 
      nucleotide deletion; c.1110delA. In the Omani kindred, all affected have a 
      homozygous two nucleotides deletion; c.364_365delTA (p.Met122ValfsTer2). Here we 
      report the results of homozygosity mapping and whole exome sequencing in two 
      siblings of a consanguineous Turkish family with mild intellectual disability, 
      spastic paraplegia, and muscular dystrophy. We identified the same deletion that has 
      been identified in the Omani kindred, but haplotype analysis suggests a recurrent 
      event, and not a founder mutation. We summarize current knowledge of Troyer 
      syndrome, and propose wider use of whole exome sequencing in routine diagnostics. 
      This applies in particular to nonspecific phenotypes with high heterogeneity, such 
      as spastic paraplegia, intellectual disability, and muscular dystrophy, since in 
      such cases the assignment of a definite diagnosis is frequently delayed.

TI  - A study of 63 cases with eyelid myoclonia with or without absences: type of seizure 
      or an epileptic syndrome?
PG  - 440-5
LID - 10.1016/j.seizure.2009.04.004 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Eyelid myoclonia and absences (EMA) induced by eye closure associated with 
      brief, fast, and generalized paroxysms of polyspikes and waves was considered as an 
      epileptic syndrome and a type of seizure as well. We analyzed the electroclinical 
      features and evolution of EMA, and tried to determine if it represents a 
      well-defined epileptic syndrome or a non-specific condition associated to other 
      epilepsies. METHODS: Between June 1994 and June 2005, 63 patients who met diagnostic 
      criteria of EMA were enrolled in the study and have been followed up to the present 
      time. RESULTS: Two main groups could be identified. The first group was divided into 
      two subgroups. One subgroup of 28 patients presented EMA associated with infrequent 
      generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS), and the other 1 of 9 patients presented 
      early-onset EMA refractory to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), associated or not with 
      GTCS and mental retardation. Four of them had self-induced seizures. The second 
      group included 26 patients with EMA associated with GTCS and/or massive myoclonias, 
      or GTCS induced by intermittent photic stimulation. All these patients had 
      electroclinical features compatible with idiopathic generalized epilepsies. 
      CONCLUSION: In the first group, EMA should be considered as a photosensitive 
      idiopathic epileptic syndrome. A subgroup of early-onset of EMA refractory to AEDs, 
      associated or not with GTCS and mental retardation should also be considered as a 
      variant or a distinct photosensitive idiopathic epileptic syndrome. Finally, in the 
      second group EMA may correspond to a type of seizures in idiopathic generalized 
      epilepsies.

TI  - MAN1B1-CDG: Three new individuals and associated biochemical profiles.
PG  - 100775
LID - 10.1016/j.ymgmr.2021.100775 [doi]
LID - 100775
AB  - Congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) constitute an ever-growing group of 
      genetic diseases affecting the glycosylation of proteins. CDG individuals usually 
      present with severe multisystem disorders. MAN1B1-CDG is a CDG with nonspecific 
      clinical symptoms such as intellectual deficiency and developmental delay. Although 
      up to 40 affected individuals were described so far, its final diagnosis is not 
      straightforward using common biochemical methods due to the trace-level accumulation 
      of defective glycan structures. In this study, we present three unreported 
      MAN1B1-CDG individuals and propose a decision tree to reach diagnosis using a panel 
      of techniques ranging from exome sequencing to gel electrophoresis and mass 
      spectrometry. The occurrence of MAN1B1-CDG in patients showing unexplained 
      intellectual disability and development delay, as well as a particular transferrin 
      glycosylation profile, can be ascertained notably using matrix assisted laser 
      desorption/ionization - time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry analysis of 
      endo-β-acetylglucosaminidase H-released serum N-glycans. In addition to reporting 
      new pathogenic variants and additional clinical signs such as hypersialorrhea, we 
      highlight particular biochemical features of MAN1B1-CDG with potential 
      glycoprotein-specific glycosylation defects.

PG  - 363-71
AB  - We report a 21-month-old girl with symptoms consistent with the Zunich 
      neuroectodermal syndrome, an apparently rare condition first described in 1983. 
      Common features of all previously reported patients as well as in this child are 
      characteristic craniofacial dysmorphism, bilateral colobomas of the retina, sparse 
      and fine hair, hearing loss, ichthyosiform erythroderma, mental retardation, ear 
      anomalies, brachydactyly, and broad second toes. Light microscopic and 
      ultrastructural investigations of the affected skin showed characteristic but 
      nonspecific changes. The structural hair shaft abnormalities as well as the 
      dysplastic nails in our patient have not been described before and are consistent 
      with the previous assumption of an ectodermal dysplasia syndrome.

PG  - 77-85
LID - 10.3233/BEN-1990-3202 [doi]
AB  - Pathological self-mutilation appears as a non-specific symptom as well as a specific 
      syndrome. Since psychotic persons may commit horrifying acts, such as enucleation of 
      an eye or amputation of a body part, identification of high risk patients is 
      crucial. Stereotypical self-mutilation, such as head banging and biting off of 
      fingertips, is associated with mental retardation and with the syndromes of 
      Lesch-Nyhan, deLange, and Tourette. This type of self-mutilation is the focus of 
      biological research or endorphins and on dopamine receptors. Skin cutting and 
      burning, the most common type of self-mutilation, is often associated with 
      personality disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, and multiple personality 
      disorder. When cutting and burning become established as responses to disturbing 
      psychological symptoms on environmental events, a specific Axis I impulse disorder 
      known as Repetitive Self Mutilation may be diagnosed. Patients with this newly 
      identified syndrome may alternate their direct acts of self-mutilation with eating 
      disorders and episodic alcoholism.

PG  - 1303-7
AB  - A girl with congenital limb weakness, mental retardation, and corneal ulceration 
      died with respiratory insufficiency at age 4 years. Histochemistry of muscle biopsy 
      showed only nonspecific myopathy, but electronmicroscopy revealed subsarcolemmal and 
      intramyofibrillar accumulation of glycogen. Biochemical studies showed increased 
      glycogen content of muscle with lack of phosphofructokinase. Phosphorylase b kinase 
      activity was about 30% of normal. The relationship of the double enzyme deficiency 
      to this unusual clinical picture is unclear.

      Thyroiditis in a Teenage Child.
PG  - 47-49
LID - 10.15605/jafes.032.01.08 [doi]
AB  - Thyroid disorders are prevalent in the paediatric population and untreated 
      hypothyroidism leads to several adverse consequences like mental retardation, 
      neurological impairment, short stature, delayed puberty and increased morbidity. 
      Owing to a wide range of non-specific clinical manifestations, one must have a high 
      index of suspicion for timely diagnosis and treatment of primary hypothyroidism. We 
      describe the case of an adolescent girl who presented with short stature, delayed 
      puberty and feeding difficulties owing to undiagnosed and subsequently untreated 
      hypothyroidism.

TI  - The clumsy child: observations in cases referred to the gymnasium of the Adelaide 
      Children's Hospital over a three-year period.
PG  - 65-9
AB  - Group treatment of clumsy children is one part of a multidisciplinary management 
      programme which is provided at The Adelaide Children's Hospital for children who 
      have multiple handicaps. This study reviews 176 children who were referred for 
      treatment. Clumsiness was the most common reason for referral. Not all children 
      benefited from group treatment, and those who had significant degrees of mental 
      retardation, or mild spasticity worsening on effort, needed individual handling. 
      Movement training aims mainly to reduce physical clumsiness, and it is hoped that 
      certain nonspecific benefits may result. The greatest improvement occurred in the 
      ability to mix with others. Group counselling of parents, with a social worker as 
      leader, is considered to have played an essential part in the management of these 
      children's problems.

TI  - Mapping genes of complex psychiatric diseases in Daghestan genetic isolates.
PG  - 76-84
AB  - Genetic isolates, which provide outstanding opportunities for identification of 
      susceptibility genes for complex diseases, can be classified as primary (having an 
      ancient demographic history in a stable environment) or secondary (having a younger 
      demographic history) Neel [1992: Minority populations: Genetics, demography, and 
      health, pp. 1-13]. Daghestan contains 26 out of 50 indigenous Caucasus ethnicities 
      that have been in existence for hundreds of generations in the same highland region. 
      The ethnic groups are subdivided into numerous primary isolates. The founder effect 
      and gene drift in these primary isolates may have caused aggregation of specific 
      haplotypes with limited numbers of pathogenic alleles and loci in some isolates 
      relative to others. These are expressed as inter-population differences in lifetime 
      prevalence and features of certain complex clinical phenotypes and in patterns of 
      genetic linkage and linkage disequilibrium (LD). Stable highland and ethnic-cultural 
      environments have led to increased penetrance and a reduced number of phenocopies, 
      which typically hamper the identification of any susceptibility genes for complex 
      diseases. Owing to these characteristics of the primary isolates, a comparative 
      linkage study in the primary isolates allows us to define the number of 
      susceptibility genes for any complex disease and to identify the source of 
      variability and non-replication of linkage analysis results. As part of an ongoing 
      study, seven extended schizophrenia and one nonspecific mental retardation kindreds 
      have been ascertained from Daghestan isolates. Lifetime morbid risk for 
      schizophrenia in the isolates varied from 0 to 5%. A genome scan with markers spaced 
      10 cM apart was carried out on these pedigrees and linkage analysis was performed 
      using descent graph methods, as implemented in Simwalk2. To identify regions 
      containing susceptibility genes within these kindreds, we followed up those regions 
      with non-parametric and parametric linkage analyses, with the choice of genetic 
      model guided by the results obtained in the NPL. While the analyses are ongoing, the 
      most positive findings were made in different isolated pedigrees on chromosomes 
      17p11, 3q24, and 22q for schizophrenia and on chromosome 12q for nonspecific mental 
      retardation.

TI  - Presynaptic dopaminergic deficits in Lesch-Nyhan disease.
PG  - 1568-72
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lesch-Nyhan disease is a rare, devastating, X-linked recessive disorder 
      of purine synthesis. Patients present with hyperuricemia, choreoathetosis, dystonia, 
      and aggressive and self-injurious behavior. Although the genetic and biochemical 
      abnormalities have been identified, the causes of the neuropsychiatric syndrome 
      remain unclear. METHODS: We used positron-emission tomography to measure presynaptic 
      accumulation of fluorodopa F 18 tracer in the dopaminergic regions of the brains of 
      12 patients with Lesch-Nyhan disease (age, 10 to 20 years) and 15 healthy controls 
      (age, 12 to 23). The results were expressed as ratios of specific to nonspecific 
      radioactive counts. A low ratio indicates decreased dopa decarboxylase activity and 
      dopamine storage. RESULTS: The fluorodopa F 18 ratio was significantly lower in the 
      putamen (31 percent of control values), caudate nucleus (39 percent), frontal cortex 
      (44 percent), and ventral tegmental complex (substantia nigra and ventral tegmentum; 
      57 percent) in the patients with Lesch-Nyhan disease than in the controls. Uptake of 
      the tracer was abnormally low even in the youngest patients tested, and there was no 
      overlap in the values between patients and controls. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with 
      Lesch-Nyhan disease have abnormally few dopaminergic nerve terminals and cell 
      bodies. The abnormality involves all dopaminergic pathways and is not restricted to 
      the basal ganglia. These dopaminergic deficits are pervasive and appear to be 
      developmental in origin, which suggests that they contribute to the characteristic 
      neuropsychiatric manifestations of the disease.

TI  - ASXL3-Related Disorder.
BTI - GeneReviews(®)
AB  - CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: ASXL3-related disorder is characterized by developmental 
      delay or intellectual disability, typically in the moderate to severe range, with 
      speech and language delay and/or absent speech. Affected individuals may also 
      display autistic features. There may be issues with feeding. While dysmorphic facial 
      features have been described, they are typically nonspecific. Affected individuals 
      may also have hypotonia that can transition to spasticity resulting in unusual 
      posture with flexion contractions of the elbows, wrists, and fingers. Other findings 
      may include poor postnatal growth, strabismus, seizures, sleep disturbance, and 
      dental anomalies. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of ASXL3-related disorder is 
      established in a proband by identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in 
      ASXL3 by molecular genetic testing. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Feeding 
      therapy; gastrostomy tube placement for those with persistent feeding issues; 
      anti-reflux medication and/or fundoplication for those with gastroesophageal 
      disease; standard treatment for epilepsy, joint contractures, sleep apnea, dental 
      anomalies, strabismus and/or refractive error, and developmental delay / 
      intellectual disability. Surveillance: At each visit: Measurement of growth 
      parameters and nutritional status; assessment of developmental progress, behavioral 
      issues, new neurologic manifestations (change in tone, seizure onset and/or 
      frequency), mobility and self-help skills, as well as signs and symptoms of sleep 
      disturbance. Dental evaluation every six months after age three years or as 
      clinically indicated. At least annual ophthalmology evaluation. GENETIC COUNSELING: 
      ASXL3-related disorder is an autosomal dominant disorder typically caused by a de 
      novo pathogenic variant. Rarely, individuals diagnosed with ASXL3-related disorder 
      have the disorder as the result of a pathogenic variant inherited from a parent. If 
      the ASXL3 pathogenic variant identified in the proband is not identified in either 
      parent, the risk to sibs is presumed to be low but greater than that of the general 
      population because of the possibility of parental germline mosaicism. Once the ASXL3 
      pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal 
      testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are 
      possible.

TI  - Syndromic Craniosynostosis Can Define New Candidate Genes for Suture Development or 
      Result from the Non-specifc Effects of Pleiotropic Genes: Rasopathies and 
      Chromatinopathies as Examples.
PG  - 587
LID - 10.3389/fnins.2017.00587 [doi]
LID - 587
AB  - Craniosynostosis is a heterogeneous condition caused by the premature fusion of 
      cranial sutures, occurring mostly as an isolated anomaly. Pathogenesis of 
      non-syndromic forms of craniosynostosis is largely unknown. In about 15-30% of cases 
      craniosynostosis occurs in association with other physical anomalies and it is 
      referred to as syndromic craniosynostosis. Syndromic forms of craniosynostosis arise 
      from mutations in genes belonging to the Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor (FGFR) 
      family and the interconnected molecular pathways in most cases. However it can occur 
      in association with other gene variants and with a variety of chromosome 
      abnormalities as well, usually in association with intellectual disability (ID) and 
      additional physical anomalies. Evaluating the molecular properties of the genes 
      undergoing intragenic mutations or copy number variations (CNVs) along with 
      prevalence of craniosynostosis in different conditions and animal models if 
      available, we made an attempt to define two distinct groups of unusual syndromic 
      craniosynostosis, which can reflect direct effects of emerging new candidate genes 
      with roles in suture homeostasis or a non-specific phenotypic manifestation of 
      pleiotropic genes, respectively. RASopathies and 9p23p22.3 deletions are reviewed as 
      examples of conditions in the first group. In particular, we found that 
      craniosynostosis is a relatively common component manifestation of 
      cardio-facio-cutaneous (CFC) syndrome. Chromatinopathies and neurocristopathies are 
      presented as examples of conditions in the second group. We observed that 
      craniosynostosis is uncommon on average in these conditions. It was randomly 
      associated with Kabuki, Koolen-de Vries/KANSL1 haploinsufficiency and Mowat-Wilson 
      syndromes and in KAT6B-related disorders. As an exception, trigonocephaly in 
      Bohring-Opitz syndrome reflects specific molecular properties of the chromatin 
      modifier ASXL1 gene. Surveillance for craniosynostosis in syndromic forms of 
      intellectual disability, as well as ascertainment of genomic CNVs by array-CGH in 
      apparently non-syndromic craniosynostosis is recommended, to allow for improvement 
      of both the clinical outcome of patients and the accurate individual diagnosis.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS), is caused by a loss-of-function mutation in the FMR1 gene 
      located on the X-chromosome, which leads to the most common cause of inherited 
      intellectual disability in males and the leading single-gene defect associated with 
      autism. A full mutation (FM) is represented by more than 200 CGG repeats within the 
      FMR1 gene, resulting in FXS. A FM is inherited from women carrying a FM or a 
      premutation (PM; 55-200 CGG repeats) allele. PM is associated with phenotypes 
      distinct from those associated with FM. Some manifestations of the PM are unique; 
      fragile-X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), and fragile-X-associated 
      primary ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI), while others tend to be non-specific such as 
      intellectual disability. In addition, women carrying a PM may suffer from 
      subfertility or infertility. There is a need to elucidate whether the impairment of 
      ovarian function found in PM carriers arises during the primordial germ cell (PGC) 
      development stage, or due to a rapidly diminishing oocyte pool throughout life or 
      even both. Due to the possibility of expansion into a FM in the next generation, and 
      other ramifications, carrying a PM can have an enormous impact on one's life; 
      therefore, preconception counseling for couples carrying the PM is of paramount 
      importance. In this review, we will elaborate on the clinical manifestations in 
      female PM carriers and propose the definition of fragile-X-associated diminished 
      ovarian reserve (FXDOR), then we will review recent scientific findings regarding 
      possible mechanisms leading to FXDOR and FXPOI. Lastly, we will discuss counseling, 
      preventative measures and interventions available for women carrying a PM regarding 
      different aspects of their reproductive life, fertility treatment, pregnancy, 
      prenatal testing, contraception and fertility preservation options.

TI  - Phylogenetic analysis of teneurin genes and comparison to the rearrangement hot spot 
      elements of E. coli.
PG  - 87-97
AB  - Teneurins are a novel family of transmembrane proteins conserved between 
      invertebrates and vertebrates. There are two members in Drosophila, one in C. 
      elegans and four members in mouse. Here, we describe the analysis of the genomic 
      structure of the human teneurin-1 gene. The entire human teneurin-1 (TEN1) gene is 
      contained in eight PAC clones representing part of the chromosomal locus Xq25. 
      Interestingly, many X-linked mental retardation syndromes (XLMR) and non-specific 
      mental retardation (MRX) are mapped to this region. The location of the human TEN1 
      together with the neuronal expression makes TEN1 a candidate gene for XLMR and MRX. 
      We also identified large parts of the human teneurin-2 sequence on chromosome 5 and 
      sections of human teneurin-4 at chromosomal position 11q14. Database searches 
      resulted in the identification of ESTs encoding parts of all four human members of 
      the teneurin family. Analysis of the genomic organization of the Drosophila ten-a 
      gene revealed the presence of exons encoding a long form of ten-a, which can be 
      aligned with all other teneurins known. Sequence comparison and phylogenetic trees 
      of teneurins show that insects and vertebrates diverged before the teneurin ancestor 
      was duplicated independently in the two phyla. This is supported by the presence of 
      conserved intron positions between teneurin genes of man, Drosophila and C. elegans. 
      It is therefore not possible to class any of the vertebrate teneurins with either 
      Drosophila Ten-a or Ten-m. The C-terminal part of all teneurins harbours 26 
      repetitive sequence motifs termed YD-repeats. YD-repeats are most similar to the 
      repeats encoded by the core of the rearrangement hot spot (rhs) elements of 
      Escherichia coli. This makes the teneurin ancestor a candidate gene for the source 
      of the rhs core acquired by horizontal gene transfer.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Few patients with interstitial deletions in the distal long arm of 
      chromosome 14 have been reported, and these patients showed rather indistinct 
      features, including growth and mental retardation and phenotypic alterations. 
      RESULTS: We describe a de novo 14q interstitial deletion in a 6-year-old boy with 
      dysmorphic facial traits such as hypertelorism, short and narrow palpebral fissures, 
      broad nose with anteverted nostrils, long philtrum, thin upper lip with cupid's bow, 
      prominent and everted lower lip, mildly low-set ears, as well as moderate 
      developmental delay and mild mental retardation. Array-CGH mapped the deletion to 
      the region 14q24.3 to 14q31.3, including 13.11 Mb, proximal to the imprinted genomic 
      region of 14q32. CONCLUSION: This mild phenotypic presentation suggests that the 
      deleted segment does not contain essential genes for early organ development. 
      Twenty-two genes with known functions, including Neurexin III (NRXN3, OMIM 600567), 
      map to the region deleted in the propositus.

TI  - Treatment effects of stimulant medication in young boys with fragile X syndrome.
PG  - 175-84
LID - 10.1007/s11689-011-9085-4 [doi]
AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited form of intellectual 
      disability and is caused by a CGG repeat expansion at Xq27.3 on the FMR1 gene. The 
      majority of young boys with FXS display poor attention and hyperactivity that is 
      disproportionate to their cognitive disability, and approximately 70% meet 
      diagnostic criteria for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Psychopharmacology 
      is employed with 82% of young males 5-17 years of age, with stimulant medication as 
      the most common medication prescribed. This study evaluated the effects of stimulant 
      medication on the academic performance, attention, motor activity, and 
      psychophysiological arousal of boys with FXS, as well as the concordance of effects 
      within individuals. Participants in this study included 12 boys with FXS who were 
      treated with stimulants. Participants completed videotaped academic testing on two 
      consecutive days and were randomly assigned to be off stimulants for 1 day and on 
      stimulants the other day. On each day, multiple measures including academic 
      performance, behavior regulation, and psychophysiological arousal were collected. 
      Approximately 75% of participants performed better on attention and academic 
      measures, and 70% showed improved physiological regulation while on stimulant 
      medication. A high degree of concordance among measures was found. Lower 
      intelligence quotient (IQ), but not age, correlated with greater improvements in 
      in-seat behavior. IQ and age did not relate to on-task behaviors. The frequency and 
      magnitude of response to stimulant medication in boys with FXS is higher than those 
      reported for most children with non-specific intellectual disabilities and autism 
      spectrum disorder.

LID - 10.4103/0028-3886.333478 [doi]
AB  - Mutations in mammalian membrane-bound O-acyltransferase domain-containing (MBOAT) 7 
      gene are a rare cause for intellectual disability, developmental delay, autistic 
      findings, epilepsy, truncal hypotonia with appendicular hypertonia, and 
      below-average head sizes. Pathogenic variants in MBOAT7 gene show these nonspecific 
      clinical features that are seen in many other neurometabolic diseases. Therefore, 
      specific neuroimaging findings can be valuable key factors for differential 
      diagnosis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of T2 hyperintensity in 
      bilateral globus pallidi and dentate nuclei are seen in a few neurometabolic 
      diseases with similar clinical features of developmental delay and hypotonia, as in 
      our cases. While evaluating the patients with similar phenotypes and specific MRI 
      findings, MBOAT7 deficiency should be kept in mind. Here, we identified two brothers 
      who had a novel homozygous variant in MBOAT7 gene and aimed to raise awareness about 
      this newly described disease.

      molecular biology].
PG  - 176-80
AB  - Among the many acquired or constitutional causes of chondrodysplasia punctata, the 
      X-linked recessive form is well individualized. CASE REPORT: A male newborn 
      presented a dysmorphic syndrome with a marked nasal hypoplasia, a macroglossia and a 
      short neck. The diagnosis of chondrodysplasia punctata was made by radiography 
      whereas the chromosomal chart revealed the existence of an additional Y fragment in 
      Xpter, effectuating a partial disomy Yp and a monosomy Xpter. Molecular biology 
      showed a deletion of very small size, isolated and located between the gene missing 
      aryl sulfatase E and the microsatellite DXS 1233, sping gene MRX2 (non-specific gene 
      of mental retardation), and making it possible to give the reassuring elements as 
      regards the psychomotor prognosis, sometimes compromised in this disorder. 
      CONCLUSION: In case of chondrodysplasia punctata with dysmorphy, it is important to 
      execute a chromosomal chart in the search for a chromosomal reorganization on the X 
      and a study in molecular biology.

TI  - Automated fluorometric analysis of galactose in blood.
PG  - 971-4
AB  - In galactosemia, prevention of mental retardation depends on early recognition of 
      the disorder and institution of dietary restriction of galactose. We describe an 
      automated fluorometric micromethod for galactose in whole blood spotted on filter 
      paper. Galactose is oxidized by galactose oxidase to D-galacto-hexadialdose and H2O2 
      and measured as the highly fluorescent condensation product of homovanillic acid 
      formed when H2O2 is acted upon by horseradish peroxidase. The procedure is 10-fold 
      more sensitive than colorimetric procedures for galactose and is not hampered by the 
      nonspecific fluorescence from endogenous NADPH that is encountered in methods in 
      which galactose dehydrogenase is used. At a sampling rate of 40/h with a 
      sample-to-wash ratio of 1/2, carryover is negligible, reproducibility is excellent, 
      and 80% of steady state is achieved. Analytical recovery of added galactose was 95%. 
      The method has the requisite sensitivity and accuracy for quantification of 
      galactosemia and galactosuria in milkfed newborn infants and genetic evaluation of 
      families of patients.

TI  - A simplified test to detect PKU heterozygotes by discriminant analysis in mentally 
      retarded children and their mothers.
PG  - 241-5
AB  - We have developed classification coefficients and an equation to detect 
      heterozygotes for phenylketonuria. The combination of several variables (Phe, 
      Phe/Tyr, Phe2/Tyr) gave a safe diagnosis in more than 96% of cases. We then 
      computerized a random selection of our population, which was divided into two 
      groups: the first was "selected" to compute discriminant functions, while the 
      second, excluded from computation, was used to check the fitness of our method. 
      Despite the reduction of sample size, 95.2% of unknown subjects were correctly 
      classified. Finally, we used our equation to detect heterozygotes for 
      phenylketonuria in a population of 26 children, affected by non-specific mental 
      retardation, and their mothers. We found a high proportion of carriers for 
      phenylketonuria, defined as subjects having a percent probability of correct 
      classification higher than 90. By this method, heterozygosity was detected in two 
      child-mother couples, four individual children and five mothers.

TI  - Ring 14 chromosome: association with seizures.
PG  - 301-5
AB  - A one-year-old male with seizures and developmental delay was found to have a ring 
      14 chromosome without a major band deletion. This brings the number of documented 
      r(14) cases to seven. These patients have focal cerebral atrophy with seizures as 
      their dominant manifestation, together with few minor facial anomalies. This 
      combination suggests that abnormalities in the 14 chromosome may result in rather 
      nonspecific central nervous system maldevelopment and dysfunction and raises the 
      possibility that unexplained seizures with minor anomalies and mental retardation 
      may warrant chromosome investigation.

AB  - Mutations in hundreds of genes contribute to cognitive and behavioral dysfunction 
      associated with developmental brain disorders (DBDs). Due to the sheer number of 
      risk factors available for study combined with the cost of developing new animal 
      models, it remains an open question how genes should be prioritized for in-depth 
      neurobiological investigations. Recent reviews have argued that priority should be 
      given to frequently mutated genes commonly found in sporadic DBD patients. Intrigued 
      by this idea, we explored to what extent "high priority" risk factors have been 
      studied in animals in an effort to assess their potential for generating valuable 
      preclinical models capable of advancing the neurobiological understanding of DBDs. 
      We found that in-depth whole animal studies are lacking for many high priority 
      genes, with relatively few neurobiological studies performed in construct valid 
      animal models aimed at understanding the pathological substrates associated with 
      disease phenotypes. However, some high priority risk factors have been extensively 
      studied in animal models and they have generated novel insights into DBD 
      patho-neurobiology while also advancing early pre-clinical therapeutic treatment 
      strategies. We suggest that prioritizing model development toward genes frequently 
      mutated in non-specific DBD populations will accelerate the understanding of DBD 
      patho-neurobiology and drive novel therapeutic strategies. This article is part of 
      the Special Issue entitled 'Synaptopathy--from Biology to Therapy'.

TI  - CHD4 Neurodevelopmental Disorder.
BTI - GeneReviews(®)
AB  - CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: CHD4 neurodevelopmental disorder (CHD4-NDD) is associated 
      with developmental delay, speech delay, and usually mild-to-moderate intellectual 
      disability. Variability between individuals with CHD4-NDD is significant, and a few 
      have normal intelligence. Other manifestations can include brain anomalies, heart 
      defects, and skeletal abnormalities; less common features are hypogonadism in males, 
      hearing impairment, and ophthalmic abnormalities. Most affected individuals have 
      mild nonspecific dysmorphic facial features with or without macrocephaly. 
      DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of CHD4-NDD is established in a proband with 
      suggestive findings and a heterozygous pathogenic variant in CHD4 identified by 
      molecular genetic testing. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Developmental 
      delay / intellectual disability, cervical spine instability and risk of spinal cord 
      compression, refractive errors and strabismus, hearing impairment, congenital heart 
      defects, behavioral issues, growth delay, hypogonadism in males, and renal anomalies 
      are managed per standard care. Surveillance: Follow up of the common manifestations 
      at each clinic visit. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Activities that involve rapid 
      neck motion and/or possible trauma to the head and neck region (e.g., contact sports 
      or thrill rides at amusement parks) because of the possible increased risk for 
      cervical spine instability and spinal cord compression. GENETIC COUNSELING: CHD4-NDD 
      is an autosomal dominant disorder typically caused by a de novo pathogenic variant. 
      If the CHD4 pathogenic variant identified in the proband is not identified in either 
      parent, the risk to sibs is low (~1%) but greater than that of the general 
      population because of the possibility of parental germline mosaicism. Once the CHD4 
      pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal and 
      preimplantation genetic testing are possible.

TI  - Incontinence in Individuals with Rett Syndrome: A Comparative Study.
PG  - 287-300
AB  - Frequency and type of incontinence and its association with other variables were 
      assessed in females with Rett Syndrome (RS) (n = 63), using an adapted Dutch version 
      of the 'Parental Questionnaire: Enuresis/Urinary Incontinence' (Beetz et al. 1994). 
      Also, incontinence in RS was compared to a control group consisting of females with 
      non-specific (mixed) intellectual disability (n = 26). Urinary incontinence (UI) 
      (i.e., daytime incontinence and nocturnal enuresis) and faecal incontinence (FI) 
      were found to be common problems among females with RS that occur in a high 
      frequency of days/nights. UI and FI were mostly primary in nature and occur 
      independent of participants' age and level of adaptive functioning. Solid stool, 
      lower urinary tract symptoms and urinary tract infections (UTI's) were also common 
      problems in females with RS. No differences in incontinence between RS and the 
      control group were found, except for solid stool that was more common in RS than in 
      the control group. It is concluded that incontinence is not part of the behavioural 
      phenotype of RS, but that there is an increased risk for solid stool in females with 
      RS.

      and Sadeh (2016).
PG  - 318-20
LID - 10.1111/jcpp.12542 [doi]
AB  - This commentary is intended to supplement the accompanying review of sleep problems 
      in childhood psychiatric disorders by Gregory and Sadeh. A number of considerations 
      are outlined because of their relevance to both clinical practice and research 
      concerning assessment and treatment of sleep disturbance in children in general and 
      especially those with psychiatric and/or neurological conditions. These 
      considerations (which illustrate the importance of combined medical and 
      psychological involvement) are as follows: the importance of screening for sleep 
      disturbance which otherwise may well be overlooked; the need to specify sleep 
      disorders rather than simply nonspecific sleep problems as this will guide choice of 
      appropriate advice and treatment; the risk of sleep disorders being misdiagnosed 
      because of clinicians' unfamiliarity with the sleep disorders field; the possibility 
      that a child's sleep disturbance is of multiple aetiology; a wide range of 
      treatments for disturbed sleep is now described from which a choice is possible 
      given an accurate diagnosis; sleep problems may be intensified if a child's 
      condition is complicated by intellectual disability but the same principles of 
      assessment and management apply as in other children in the expectation that 
      treatment can be effective.

TI  - Ichthyosis follicularis, alopecia, and photophobia (IFAP) syndrome.
PG  - 29
LID - 10.1186/1750-1172-6-29 [doi]
AB  - The IFAP syndrome is a rare X-linked genetic disorder reported in nearly 40 
      patients. It is characterized by the triad of Ichthyosis Follicularis, Alopecia, and 
      Photophobia from birth. Other features such as short stature, intellectual 
      disability, and seizures may develop in the first few years of life. Skin 
      histopathology is non-specific and consists of dilated hair follicles with keratin 
      plugs extending above the surface of the skin, decreased or absent sebaceous glands, 
      and decreased desmosomes in number and size. The disorder results from mutations in 
      the MBTPS2 gene that impairs cholesterol homeostasis and the ability to cope with 
      endoplasmic reticulum stress. Follicular hyperkeratosis can be treated using topical 
      keratolytics, emollients and urea preparations. A moderate response to acitretin 
      therapy has been noted in some patients. Intensive lubrication of the ocular surface 
      is essential. Life expectancy in patients with IFAP syndrome can vary from death in 
      the neonatal period to normal surviving. Cardiopulmonary complications remain the 
      major cause of death.

TI  - Leucocyte migration inhibition factor (LIF) production by lymphocytes of normal 
      children, newborns, and children with immune deficiency.
PG  - 448-54
AB  - The reproducibility of a simplified, sensitive and rapid agarose-cell droplet assay 
      for leucocyte migration inhibition factor (LIF) activity was studied. Removal of T 
      cells with anti-T-cell serum eliminated LIF activity, indicating that in humans it 
      is probably the T cell that produces LIF. Cord blood lymphocytes produce LIF, 
      although spontaneous migration of leucocytes is less than in older children. The 
      cause of this apparently does not reside in the PMN leucocytes. Studies of children 
      with immunodeficiency suggest that the T-cell population in humans is heterogenous. 
      B-cell deficiencies such as hypogammaglobulinaemia, have normal PPD and PHA induced 
      LIF production, whilst some patients with ataxia-telangiectasia have defective PPD 
      LIF activity, their PHA LIF activity being only minimally depressed. On the other 
      hand, Down's syndrome patients with reduced blood T cells have remarkably deficient 
      LIF activity to PHA and relatively good activity to PPD. Children receiving steroid 
      therapy lose much of their ability to produce LIF to the specific antigen PPD, but 
      not to the non-specific mitogen PHA.

TI  - [Ocular defects associated with a duplication of the distal part of the long arm of 
      chromosome 1: a case report].
PG  - 388-92
AB  - The authors report a case of de novo duplication 1q32-qter present in a patient with 
      dysmorphic syndrome and developmental delay. This article describes the eighth case 
      of partial trisomy 1q32-qter "pure", without chromosomal abnormalities. In the 
      literature, a dysmorphic "syndrome" is described for trisomy 1q32-qter: 
      hypertelorism, low set and malformed ears, prominent forehead, long philtrum, 
      antimongoloid slanting, foot and digital malformations, cardiovascular 
      abnormalities, urogenital abnormalities, and mental retardation. The ocular defects 
      described in previously reported cases include: cataract, strabismus, hypoplasia of 
      the optic disk, microphthalmia, epicanthal folds, ptosis, persistent tunica 
      vasculosa lentis, and hyaloid vessels, but this seems to be nonspecific of this 
      chromosomal abnormality.

PG  - 197-200
LID - 10.4274/jcrpe.v1i4.54 [doi]
AB  - Congenital hypothyroidism is one of the most urgent diseases of the neonate. When 
      diagnosed and treated at an early stage, its most important complication, mental 
      retardation, is preventable. The signs of congenital hypothyroidism are nonspecific 
      in neonates. Only 5% of the cases have characteristic clinical findings. One of the 
      most important and earliest signs is prolonged jaundice during the neonatal period. 
      We report herein a case of congenital hypothyroidism, who presented with icterus 
      accompanied with sludge formation into the gallbladder, which disappeared after 
      treatment with L-thyroxine.

TI  - Genes for cognitive function: developments on the X.
PG  - 157-63
AB  - Developments in human genome research enabled the first steps toward a molecular 
      understanding of cognitive function. That there are numerous genes on the X 
      chromosome affecting intelligence at the lower end of the cognitive range is no 
      longer in doubt. Naturally occurring mutations have so far led to the identification 
      of seven genes accounting for a small proportion of familial nonspecific X-linked 
      mental retardation. These new data indicate that normal expression of many more 
      X-linked and autosomal genes contribute to cognitive function. The emerging 
      knowledge implicating genes in intracellular signaling pathways provides the insight 
      to identify as candidates other X-linked and autosomal genes regulating the normal 
      development of cognitive function. Recent advances in unravelling the underlying 
      molecular complexity have been spectacular but represent only the beginning, and new 
      technologies will need to be introduced to complete the picture.

TI  - Sanfilippo's syndrome type C--the first known case in South Africa.
PG  - 63-8
AB  - The clinical, radiological and biochemical findings in a black girl with a rare, 
      inherited mucopolysaccharide storage disease, Sanfilippo's syndrome 
      (mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) III) type C, are described. Practical points concerning 
      the biochemical diagnosis of this condition, arising from unusual characteristics of 
      the deficient enzyme acetyl CoA: alpha-glucosaminide N-acetyltransferase, are 
      discussed. Because phenotypic manifestations of mucopolysaccharidosis are mild in 
      all four types of Sanfilippo's syndrome and screening tests for 
      mucopolysacchariduria in these patients may be negative, many cases may be passed 
      unrecognized or simply labelled as cases of nonspecific mental retardation. It is 
      suggested that Sanfilippo's syndrome is grossly underdiagnosed in the RSA and 
      clinicians are urged to develop a greater awareness of the existence, and often 
      subtle presentation, of the condition.

TI  - Congenital familial myopathy with type 2 fiber hypoplasia and type 1 fiber 
      predominance.
PG  - 362-5
AB  - A 12-month-old girl with delayed developmental milestones, due to muscle hypotonia 
      and weakness from early infancy, exhibited type 2 fiber hypoplasia. A muscle biopsy 
      specimen disclosed type 1 fiber predominance and type 2B fiber deficiency compatible 
      with congenital myopathy. During the following 4 years, she continued to have mild 
      muscle weakness, but no mental retardation. Her mother had similar symptoms from 
      early infancy with minimal progression. Although type 2 fiber hypoplasia is a 
      non-specific finding in various diseases, it may be a specific finding in a limited 
      number of patients with hereditary congenital non-progressive myopathy.

TI  - Interstitial deletion of 8p: report of two patients and review of the literature.
PG  - 41-5
AB  - Two female infants with de novo interstitial deletions of 8p were studied. One with 
      a deletion from p11.21 to p11.23, and the other patient with a deletion from p11.23 
      to p21.3 had several clinical manifestations of the terminal 8p- syndrome. Band 
      8p11.23 was deleted in both patients. The clinical manifestations common to both 
      patients included low birthweight, growth deficiency, congenital heart disease, 
      mental retardation, dolichocephaly, low-set, malformed ears, high-arched palate, 
      thin lips and micrognathia. Since these features may occur in most patients with 
      chromosomal imbalance, and the terminal 8p- syndrome has hitherto been assumed to 
      result from terminal deletions of 8p, ranging from p21.3 to p23, it is likely that 
      these features are simply related to the chromosomal imbalance rather than to band 
      specific imbalance of 8p11.23. The present study suggests that two different types 
      of deletion, interstitial and terminal, are associated with still poorly defined, 
      rather non-specific clinical features.

TI  - Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain in congenital cytomegalovirus infection.
PG  - 91-3
AB  - Ten children (age 2 months to 8 years) with a congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) 
      infection were studied by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using a 2.35 Tesla 
      magnet. CMV infection was confirmed by serological investigations and virus culture 
      in the neonatal period. Nine children had severe mental retardation and cerebral 
      palsy, 1 patient suffered from microcephaly, ataxia and deafness. The cranial MRI 
      examination showed the following abnormalities (N): dilated lateral ventricles (10) 
      and subarachnoid space (8), oligo/pachygyria (8), delayed/pathological myelination 
      (7), paraventricular cysts (6), intracerebral calcification (1). This lack of 
      sensitivity for calcification is explainable by the basic principles of MRI. The 
      paraventricular cystic lesions were adjacent to the occipital horns of the lateral 
      ventricles and separated only by a thin membrane. This finding might represent a 
      "new sign" for congenital CMV infection in MRI examinations, being characteristic 
      but nevertheless nonspecific, like calcification in CT.

TI  - Identifying specific prefrontal neurons that contribute to autism-associated 
      abnormalities in physiology and social behavior.
PG  - 2078-2089

AB  - Functional imaging and gene expression studies both implicate the medial prefrontal 
      cortex (mPFC), particularly deep-layer projection neurons, as a potential locus for 
      autism pathology. Here, we explored how specific deep-layer prefrontal neurons 
      contribute to abnormal physiology and behavior in mouse models of autism. First, we 
      find that across three etiologically distinct models-in utero valproic acid (VPA) 
      exposure, CNTNAP2 knockout and FMR1 knockout-layer 5 subcortically projecting (SC) 
      neurons consistently exhibit reduced input resistance and action potential firing. 
      To explore how altered SC neuron physiology might impact behavior, we took advantage 
      of the fact that in deep layers of the mPFC, dopamine D2 receptors (D2Rs) are mainly 
      expressed by SC neurons, and used D2-Cre mice to label D2R+ neurons for calcium 
      imaging or optogenetics. We found that social exploration preferentially recruits 
      mPFC D2R+ cells, but that this recruitment is attenuated in VPA-exposed mice. 
      Stimulating mPFC D2R+ neurons disrupts normal social interaction. Conversely, 
      inhibiting these cells enhances social behavior in VPA-exposed mice. Importantly, 
      this effect was not reproduced by nonspecifically inhibiting mPFC neurons in 
      VPA-exposed mice, or by inhibiting D2R+ neurons in wild-type mice. These findings 
      suggest that multiple forms of autism may alter the physiology of specific 
      deep-layer prefrontal neurons that project to subcortical targets. Furthermore, a 
      highly overlapping population-prefrontal D2R+ neurons-plays an important role in 
      both normal and abnormal social behavior, such that targeting these cells can elicit 
      potentially therapeutic effects.

TI  - Squalene Synthase Deficiency.
BTI - GeneReviews(®)
AB  - CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Squalene synthase deficiency (SQSD) is a rare inborn error 
      of cholesterol biosynthesis with multisystem clinical manifestations similar to 
      Smith-Lemli-Optiz syndrome. Key clinical features include facial dysmorphism, a 
      generalized seizure disorder presenting in the neonatal period, nonspecific 
      structural brain malformations, cortical visual impairment, optic nerve hypoplasia, 
      profound developmental delay / intellectual disability, dry skin with 
      photosensitivity, and genital malformations in males. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: Individuals 
      with SQSD have a unique urine metabolic profile with increased saturated and 
      unsaturated branched-chain dicarboxylic acids and glucuronides derived from 
      farnesol. The diagnosis of squalene synthase deficiency is established in a proband 
      with characteristic urine metabolites on urine organic acids analysis or by the 
      identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in FDFT1 by molecular genetic 
      testing. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Currently there are no specific 
      disease-modifying treatments. Standard treatment for epilepsy, congenital heart 
      defects, constipation, cryptorchidism, hypospadias, spasticity, and developmental 
      delay / intellectual disability is appropriate. Feeding therapy may be useful, 
      although placement of a gastrostomy tube is recommended for those with dysphagia 
      and/or poor growth. In those with visual impairment, early intervention may help to 
      stimulate visual development. In those with sleep disturbance, a trial of melatonin 
      may be considered. Surveillance: At each visit: asses for new manifestations such as 
      seizures, changes in tone, and movement disorder; monitor developmental progress, 
      educational needs, and behavior; assess for evidence of aspiration or respiratory 
      insufficiency; assess for evidence of sleep disorder; monitor growth, nutritional 
      status, and signs and symptoms of constipation. Ophthalmology evaluation annually or 
      as clinically indicated. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Sun and UV light exposure; 
      skin photosensitivity has produced clinically significant UV-related sunburns within 
      ten minutes of direct sunlight exposure. GENETIC COUNSELING: SQSD is inherited in an 
      autosomal recessive manner. At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 
      25% change of being affected, a 50% change of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 
      25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Carrier testing for at-risk 
      relatives and prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk are possible if the 
      FDFT1 pathogenic variants in the family are known.

TI  - Candidiasis-endocrinopathy syndrome with progressive myopathy.
PG  - 139-44
AB  - A women suffering from the candidiasis-endocrinopathy syndrome, developed severe 
      myopathy in her fourth decade and died from it at the age of 37 years. Associated 
      conditions were hypoparathyroidism, vitiligo, chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis, 
      short stature, intellectual disability, ovarian failure and alopecia totalis. Muscle 
      biopsy findings were non-specific with focal atrophy of type 2 fibres. Serum 
      immunoglobulin levels were normal. The only demonstrable abnormalities of her immune 
      system were impaired T-cell function and antibody production by B-cells (detectable 
      to smooth muscle, mitochondria and gastric parietal cells). The T-cell abnormality 
      may have been part of a more generalized cell defect, resulting from an unidentified 
      genetic abnormality, whilst the circulating antibodies could have been a response to 
      tissue damage. There was no convincing evidence of primary autoimmune damage.

AB  - Altered responses to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in obstructive sleep 
      apnea syndrome (OSAS), restless legs syndrome (RLS), insomnia, and sleep-deprived 
      healthy subjects have been reported. We have reviewed the relevant literature in 
      order to identify eventual distinctive electrocortical profiles based on single and 
      paired-pulse TMS, sensorimotor modulation, plasticity-related and repetitive TMS 
      measures. Although obtained from heterogeneous studies, the detected changes might 
      be the result of the different pathophysiological substrates underlying OSAS, RLS, 
      insomnia and sleep deprivation rather than reflect the general effect of 
      non-specific sleep loss and instability. OSAS tends to exhibit an increased motor 
      cortex inhibition, which is reduced in RLS; intracortical excitability seems to be 
      in favor of an "activating" profile in chronic insomnia and in sleep-deprived 
      healthy individuals. Abnormal plasticity-related TMS phenomena have been 
      demonstrated in OSAS and RLS. This review provides a perspective of TMS techniques 
      by further understanding the role of neurotransmission pathways and plastic 
      remodeling of neuronal networks involved in common sleep disorders. TMS might be 
      considered a valuable tool in the assessment of sleep disorders, the evaluation of 
      the effect of therapy and the design of non-pharmacological approaches.

TI  - Secondary late-onset Lennox-Gastaut syndrome: a critical view.
PG  - 95-104
AB  - From a group of 66 patients with the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, 12 whose 
      manifestations had started after the 6th year of life were selected for study. These 
      patients were observed clinically and electroencephalographically for an average 
      period of 2.5 years. We concluded that the late-onset syndrome can: occur after a 
      long interval between diffuse encephalopathy and the first clinical manifestations, 
      with or without previous alterations in psychomotor development; be associated from 
      the onset with serious mental retardation; exhibit simple, complex and mixed 
      seizures similar to those observed in the early form. These patients can also: 
      suffer complex and mixed epileptic seizures previously unreported; paroxysmal 
      interictal EEG abnormalities that overlap those of the early form; and spike-slow 
      wave complexes in the EEG that can be actived by hyperpnea. Our results demonstrate 
      that the incidence of LGS after 6 years of age does not necessarily imply a lower 
      frequency of organic antecedents, or better neuropsychomotor development up to the 
      onset of the syndrome or the presence of a higher rate of nonspecific seizures 
      (generalized or partial seizures, and mainly those with elaborate symptomatology). 
      The critical and encephalographic expression of the syndrome, which is secondary and 
      starts after the 6th year of age, may depend at least in part on the age when 
      diffuse encephalopathy started.

AB  - We determined the genomic organization of the human OPA-containing gene (HOPA) and 
      characterized its developmental expression. The gene encoding HOPA, which contains a 
      rare polymorphism tightly associated with non-specific mental retardation, is 25 kb 
      in length and consists of 44 exons. A promoter scan analysis demonstrates two 
      possible transcription initiation sites without TATA boxes upstream from the 
      putative translation initiation start site. Several informative polymorphisms are 
      evident in the sequence including a large pentanucleotide repeat. Northern blot 
      analysis of the gene transcript and its murine orthologue, MOPA-1, demonstrates that 
      only one transcript is expressed throughout the soma and the CNS, and that the 
      transcript is highly expressed during early fetal development. We conclude that the 
      delineation of the function of the HOPA gene locus merits further study.

TI  - Joubert Syndrome: A Molar Tooth Sign in Disguise.
PG  - e9718
LID - 10.7759/cureus.9718 [doi]
LID - e9718
AB  - Joubert syndrome (JS) is a rare genetic ciliopathy characterized by the aplasia or 
      malformation of the midbrain and or hindbrain structures. It usually manifests 
      during the early stages with nonspecific neurological symptoms that progress to 
      involve multiple systems. Its presentation similarity to other neurological 
      disorders makes the diagnosis difficult, hence causing a delay in treatment and 
      worse prognosis due to complications. If undiagnosed during childhood, it often 
      presents during adolescence with the most common complication of acute kidney injury 
      due to nephronophthisis. Here, we present a case of JS in late adolescence with 
      renal complications and other neurological abnormalities. We aim to emphasize the 
      importance of its early diagnosis by physicians in childhood to prevent further 
      complications. It also highlights the possible diagnostic value and significance of 
      brain imaging in the early stages when only mild mental retardation signs may be the 
      only clues.

PG  - 917-22

AB  - We report four infants (two males, two females) with ring 14 chromosome presenting 
      with early-onset partial epilepsy. The first seizure occurred between 3 and 6 months 
      (3, 3, 4, and 6mo respectively). In all four cases, diagnosis was based on early 
      focal seizures, rather than on psychomotor retardation or morphological features, 
      which were not prominent at seizure onset. Moreover, despite the young age of the 
      patients and the high frequency of seizures, neither epileptic spasms nor 
      progression to 'epileptic encephalopathy', such as hypsarrhythmia, were observed. 
      Epilepsy remained partial in these patients. At the most recent follow-up, all four 
      children had slight or mild psychomotor delay, and two of them had moderate 
      non-specific dysmorphic traits. Data from the literature about epilepsy in ring 14 
      chromosome syndrome were also reviewed. Ring 14 chromosome syndrome may be revealed 
      by isolated, early-onset focal epilepsy suggestive of focal lesions with only mild 
      mental retardation and morphological features at the time of diagnosis. The 
      characteristics of these observations differ from classic ring 14 syndrome, and may 
      enlarge this clinical spectrum. Many unanswered questions remain concerning 
      phenotype-genotype correlation and identification of the potential genes and 
      molecular mechanisms responsible for epilepsy in patients with ring 14 syndrome.

TI  - [Study of a Tunisian population of children with learning disorders].
PG  - 382-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Learning disorders are increasingly a concern for Tunisians parents. 
      These difficulties are divided into two groups: specific learning disabilities and 
      non-specific learning disorders. AIM: Our work is part of a federated research 
      project. Our aim is to determine the incidence, etiology and management of learning 
      disorders in the region of Sfax. METHODS: We conducted a descriptive cross-sectional 
      study on a population of 304 children assessed by their teachers as having academic 
      difficulty. A multidisciplinary assessment including a neurological examination, an 
      assessment of score of intelligence and language assessment has been performed for 
      209 children. RESULTS: Referring to our sample, learning disorders affect 21.3% of 
      children in the region Sfax. The frequency of specific learning disorder is 
      estimated at 10.3% (reading disorder 5.9%, dyscalculia 2.4%, reading disorder 
      associated with dyscalculia 2%). Non-specific learning disorders were found in 11% 
      of children. Etiologies in this group were dominated by mental retardation (2.1%), 
      inappropriate education (2.3%). CONCLUSION: Our study revealed the high frequency of 
      learning difficulties. It allows us to distinguish between specific learning 
      disabilities and non specific learning disorders secondary to neurological or 
      precarious socio-economic conditions. However, the profile and severity of specific 
      learning disorders could not be studied due to the lack of standardized Arabic tests 
      in Tunisia. In countries with a lack of professional and specialized unit care as in 
      Tunisia, reading interventions in school should be proposed. Only children with 
      remaining difficulties after this training will be sent to specialized 
      professionals.

TI  - Pentasomy 49,XXXXY diagnosed in utero: case report and systematic review of 
      antenatal findings.
PG  - 1-5
LID - 10.1159/000236351 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Pentasomy 49,XXXXY is a rare sex chromosome polysomy usually diagnosed 
      postnatally by the combina- tion of mental retardation, facial dysmorphism, and 
      genital, cardiac and skeletal malformations. Prenatal detection of 49,XXXXY is 
      unusual and may be incidental due to non-specific ultrasound (US) findings. We 
      report a case of 49,XXXXY diagnosed prenatally and present a literature review of 
      the few prenatally diagnosed cases. METHODS: We searched the PubMed electronic 
      database without year and language restriction, using the keywords 'Prenatal', 
      'Diagnosis', and '49,XXXY', performing a systematic review. RESULTS: We report a 
      35-year-old patient with normal first-trimester US but increased combined risk for 
      trisomies 18 and 13. Amniocentesis at 16 weeks of gestation revealed a 49,XXXXY 
      karyotype. Pregnancy was terminated at 19 weeks' gestation, and a male fetus with 
      facial dysmorphism and hypospadia was delivered. A total of 12 articles were 
      identified in the systematic review. All were case reports and dated from 1980 until 
      2008. The mean maternal age was 34.8 years (range 30-41). The most common prenatal 
      US feature was cystic hygroma, present in 5 cases. Hypogenitalism was the most 
      common macroscopic clinical feature identified after pathology examination in 7 
      cases. In 2 cases, there was an increase in first-trimester combined risk for 
      trisomy 21. CONCLUSIONS: Pentasomy 49,XXXXY is associated with a variety of 
      non-specific US findings, of which cystic hygroma was the commonest. No specific 
      sequence of findings could be identified in this review.

TI  - Neuropsychopathology in 7 Patients with the 22q13 Deletion Syndrome: Presence of 
      Bipolar Disorder and Progressive Loss of Skills.
PG  - 14-20
AB  - The 22q13 deletion syndrome is characterised by intellectual disability (ID), 
      delayed or absent speech, autistic-like behaviour and minor, nonspecific dysmorphic 
      features. The deletion of the SHANK3 gene is thought to be responsible for these 
      features. In this study, the clinical data of 7 patients with the 22q13 deletion 
      syndrome are presented, obtained by clinical genetic examination, direct behavioural 
      observation and by interview of family members and/or caregivers, complemented by 
      behavioural questionnaires. The specific focus was on behaviour, psychopathology and 
      the level of functioning during life course in order to determine common features 
      that might contribute to the delineation of the syndrome. Major findings were a high 
      incidence of psychiatric disorders, more in particular bipolar disorder (BPD) and 
      attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and a sudden deterioration after 
      acute events, in addition to a progressive loss of skills over years. Therefore, a 
      deletion of SHANK3 may result in a dysfunctional nervous system, more susceptible to 
      developmental problems and psychiatric disorders on the one hand, less able to 
      recuperate after psychiatric and somatic events, and more vulnerable to degeneration 
      at long term on the other hand. These results are exploratory and need to be 
      confirmed in a larger sample.

AB  - Patients with 15q duplication syndromes, including isodicentric chromosome 15 and 
      interstitial duplications, usually present with autism spectrum disorder, 
      intellectual disability, and frequently epilepsy. Neuroimaging studies in these 
      patients are typically reported as normal, but nonspecific findings such as thinning 
      of the corpus callosum and increased pericerebral spaces have been reported. A 
      review of brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies of 11 individuals seen at 
      the Massachusetts General Hospital Dup15q Center was performed. Hippocampus 
      morphology was specifically reviewed, as a recent neuropathologic study has found 
      frequent hippocampal heterotopias and dysplasias in these disorders. Two subjects 
      had unilateral hippocampal sclerosis and 6 had bilateral hippocampal malformations. 
      Hypoplasia of the corpus callosum was present in 2 subjects.

TI  - Adult Leukodystrophies: A Step-by-Step Diagnostic Approach.
PG  - 153-168
LID - 10.1148/rg.2019180081 [doi]
AB  - Leukodystrophies usually affect children, but in the last several decades, many 
      instances of adult leukodystrophies have been reported in the medical literature. 
      Because the clinical manifestation of these diseases can be nonspecific, MRI can 
      help with establishing a diagnosis. A step-by-step approach to assist in the 
      diagnosis of adult leukodystrophies is proposed in this article. The first step is 
      to identify symmetric white matter involvement, which is more commonly observed in 
      these patients. The next step is to fit the symmetric white matter involvement into 
      one of the proposed patterns. However, a patient may present with more than one 
      pattern of white matter involvement. Thus, the third step is to evaluate for five 
      distinct characteristics-including enhancement, lesions with signal intensity 
      similar to that of cerebrospinal fluid, susceptibility-weighted MRI signal intensity 
      abnormalities, abnormal peaks at MR spectroscopy, and spinal cord involvement-to 
      further narrow the differential diagnosis. (©)RSNA, 2019.

AB  - Epigenomic abnormalities caused by genetic mutation in epigenetic regulators can 
      result in neurodevelopmental disorders, deficiency in neural plasticity and mental 
      retardation. As a histone demethylase, plant homeodomain finger protein 8 (Phf8) is 
      a candidate gene for syndromal and non-specific forms of X-chromosome-linked 
      intellectual disability (XLID). Here we report that Phf8 knockout mice displayed 
      impaired learning and memory, and impaired hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) 
      without gross morphological defects. We also show that mTOR signaling pathway is 
      hyperactive in hippocampus in Phf8 knockout mouse. Mechanistically, we show that 
      demethylation of H4K20me1 by Phf8 results in transcriptional suppression of RSK1 and 
      homeostasis of mTOR signaling. Pharmacological suppression of mTOR signaling with 
      rapamycin in Phf8 knockout mice recovers the weakened LTP and cognitive deficits. 
      Together, our results indicate that loss of Phf8 in animals causes deficient 
      learning and memory by epigenetic disruption of mTOR signaling, and provides a 
      potential therapeutic drug target to treat XLID.

TI  - Prevention of hyperthermia-induced seizures in immature rats by a hydantoin 
      derivative of naloxone.
PG  - 857-62
AB  - The non-specific opiate antagonist naloxone protects immature rats from hyperthermic 
      seizures which occur when the animals are exposed to an environment of 40 degrees C 
      and 55% humidity. Most of the currently used antiepileptic therapeutic agents can be 
      said to contain either a hydantoin or a moiety stereochemically closely related to 
      one. We have added a hydantoin group to naloxone and created a new combined 
      chemical, naloxyl-6-alpha spirohydantoin. The new compound was ten times as 
      effective as naloxone against hyperthermic seizures in 15-day old rat pups. Unlike 
      naloxone, the new naloxone-hydantoin derivative retained a protective effect 24 hrs 
      after injection.

TI  - Severe epilepsy with multiple independent spike foci.
PG  - 442-8
AB  - Severe epilepsy with multiple independent spike foci is an electroclinical entity 
      with the following characteristics: (1) EEG showing multiple independent spike foci 
      (three or more foci in both hemisphere, i.e., at least one in each hemisphere) and 
      diffuse slowing of the background activity, (2) very frequent multiple types of 
      seizures but mainly generalized minor seizures, (3) frequent association with mental 
      retardation and neurologic abnormalities, (4) underlying causes of various 
      nonspecific prenatal, perinatal, and postnatal cerebral conditions, and (5) poor 
      prognoses for seizures and psychomotor development. It represents a diffuse 
      encephalopathy with mutual transition between other age-dependent epileptic 
      encephalopathies. This electroclinical condition may be appropriately named 
      Markand-Blume-Ohtahara syndrome, after Markand and Blume, who initially described in 
      detail the EEG pattern of multifocal spike discharges with its major clinical 
      correlates, and Ohtahara, who extensively studied the group of patients with both 
      clinical and EEG characteristics and proposed the concept of severe epilepsy with 
      multiple independent spike foci, classifying it as one type of generalized epilepsy.

TI  - Basal ganglia calcification.
PG  - 507-9
AB  - Basal ganglia calcification (BGC) is now being diagnosed with increasing frequency 
      with widespread application of computed tomography (CT) in clinical practice and is 
      no more considered a rarity. During the period 1987 to 1995, 42 patients were noted 
      to have BGC and it constituted 0.93% of all CT scan of brain carried out during the 
      relevant period. These patients presented with diverse neurological and endocrine 
      disorders i.e., epilepsy (22 patients), mental retardation (five patients), 
      extra-pyramidal syndromes (five patients), abnormal behaviour (three patients), 
      stroke (two patients), raised intracranial tension without localizing signs (one 
      patient), following radiotherapy (one patient), and with hypoparathyroidism (three 
      patients). These patients were noted to have variable degree of calcification in 
      different parts of brain i.e., basal ganglia (42 cases), cerebellum (12 cases) and 
      cerebral cortex (nine cases). Family history of a neurological disorder was 
      available in five patients. This study highlights the fact that calcification of 
      basal ganglia and other parts of the brain is often a nonspecific finding on CT scan 
      and it may not be possible to establish a clinicopathological correlation.

TI  - Characterisation and expression of a large, 13.7 kb FMR2 isoform.
PG  - 157-62
AB  - FMR2 is the gene associated with FRAXE fragile site non-specific mental retardation 
      (FRAXE MRX). Previously a male patient was identified with developmental delay and 
      speech problems who had a deletion within intron 3 of FMR2. No known FMR2 exonic 
      sequences were missing in this patient. Detailed northern blot analysis revealed 
      existence of a new large isoform of FRM2 in foetal brain. This isoform was 
      characterised and found to be due entirely to an addition of an extra 4.9 kb of the 
      3' UTR to the previously characterised 8.755 kb FMR2 transcript. This excluded 
      involvement of the large FMR2 isoform in the MRX phenotype of three individuals now 
      known to have the same deletion of intron 3 FMR2 sequences. Expression studies on 
      the new 13.7 kb FMR2 isoform show that it is expressed predominantly in foetal brain 
      and adult pituitary gland, whilst the expression of the shorter previously 
      characterised 8.755 kb isoform is broader, including testis, thymus and placenta. 
      Possible consequences of the alternative processing and expression of FMR2 for the 
      molecular pathology of FRAXE MRX are discussed.

TI  - Do children with autism perceive second-order relational features? The case of the 
      Thatcher illusion.
PG  - 1246-57
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study presents two experiments that investigated whether children 
      with autism were susceptible to the Thatcher illusion. Perception of the Thatcher 
      illusion requires being able to compute second-order configural relations for facial 
      stimuli. METHOD: In both experiments children with autism were matched for 
      non-verbal and verbal ability with a group of children with moderate (non-specific) 
      mental retardation (MLD) and a group of typically developing children respectively. 
      Participants were asked to detect the 'unusual' face in a 
      two-alternative-forced-choice version of the Margaret Thatcher illusion with 
      grey-scale (Experiment 1) and monochrome 'Mooney' face images (Experiment 2). In 
      Experiment 1 participants also performed a control task where buildings had been 
      doctored in the same way as the facial stimuli. RESULTS: Children with autism were 
      as susceptible to the Thatcher illusion as both control groups, in terms of accuracy 
      and reaction time to make decisions about which face was unusual. Children with 
      autism performed more accurately than children with MLD in the buildings task. 
      CONCLUSION: Children with autism are able to compute second-order configural 
      features in faces and exhibit no difference in face processing, relative to 
      appropriate control groups.

TI  - Familial 'partial 9p' trisomy: six cases and four carriers in three generations.
PG  - 57-61
AB  - Six cases of translocation trisomy for the distal half of the short arm of a number 
      9 chromosome and four asymptomatic balanced translocation carriers are presented in 
      a three-generation pedigree. The clinical features are remarkably similar to those 
      recently recognized and increasingly reported in full short arm (9p) trisomy and 
      should be considered a modification of the same syndrome. In addition to 
      non-specific mental retardation and short stature, there is, in common, a 
      characteristic facies, including down-turned corners of the mouth, a slightly 
      bulbous nose, moderately large ears, suggestively wide-set eyes with an 
      antimongoloid slant, dysplasia and hypolasis of the nails, clindactyly of the 5th 
      fingers, and abnormal dermatoglyphs. It appears that the 'trisomy 9p syndrome' in 
      its variant forms, including trisomies for more or less than just the short (p) arm, 
      is one of the most common clinical autosome anomalies in humans, exceeded only by 
      trisomy 21 (Down's syndrome) and possibly trisomies of chromosomes 13 and 18.

TI  - Kinetic comparison of tissue non-specific and placental human alkaline phosphatases 
      expressed in baculovirus infected cells: application to screening for Down's 
      syndrome.
PG  - 2
AB  - BACKGROUND: In humans, there are four alkaline phosphatases, and each form exhibits 
      a characteristic pattern of tissue distribution. The availability of an easy method 
      to reveal their activity has resulted in large amount of data reporting correlations 
      between variations in activity and illnesses. For example, alkaline phosphatase from 
      neutrophils of mothers pregnant with a trisomy 21 fetus (Down's syndrome) displays 
      significant differences both in its biochemical and immunological properties, and in 
      its affinity for some specific inhibitors. RESULTS: To analyse these differences, 
      the biochemical characteristics of two isozymes (non specific and placental alkaline 
      phosphatases) were expressed in baculovirus infected cells. Comparative analysis of 
      the two proteins allowed us to estimate the kinetic constants of denaturation and 
      sensitivity to two inhibitors (L-p-bromotetramisole and thiophosphate), allowing 
      better discrimination between the two enzymes. These parameters were then used to 
      estimate the ratio of the two isoenzymes in neutrophils of pregnant mothers with or 
      without a trisomy 21 fetus. It appeared that the placental isozyme represented 13% 
      of the total activity of neutrophils of non pregnant women. This proportion did not 
      significantly increase with normal pregnancy. By contrast, in pregnancies with 
      trisomy 21 fetus, the proportion reached 60-80% of activity. CONCLUSION: 
      Over-expression of the placental isozyme compared with the tissue-nonspecific form 
      in neutrophils of mother with a trisomy 21 fetus may explain why the characteristics 
      of the alkaline phosphatase in these cells is different from normal. Application of 
      this knowledge could improve the potential of using alkaline phosphatase 
      measurements to screen for Down's syndrome.

      Beaulieu-Boycott-Innes syndrome.
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.a.62667 [doi]
AB  - Beaulieu-Boycott-Innes syndrome (BBIS; MIM#613680) is a rare, autosomal recessive 
      neurodevelopmental genetic disorder associated with pathogenic variants in the THOC6 
      gene (*615403). Intellectual disability, dysmorphic facial features, developmental 
      delay, structural cardiac and genitourinary anomalies, and dental caries are 
      suggestive findings of the syndrome. Exome sequencing (ES) may facilitate the 
      diagnosis of this syndrome, whose clinical features can be nonspecific. Here we 
      report a BBIS patient with a homozygous truncating variant (NM_024339.5:c.299G>A; 
      p.Trp100Ter) in the THOC6 gene, diagnosed by ES analysis. The patient's variant is 
      novel and some features such as clivus dysplasia, occult spina bifida, tapered 
      fingers, and upturned fleshy earlobes have not been reported in the literature 
      before. This new case report will expand the knowledge of BBIS and provide more 
      information about the genetic variants and phenotypic spectrum. Also, new cases with 
      THOC6 variants will define the core clinical features and common phenotypes of the 
      BBIS over time.

TI  - Testing for Inborn Errors of Metabolism.
PG  - 37-56
LID - 10.1212/CON.0000000000000563 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This article provides an overview of genetic metabolic disorders 
      that can be identified by metabolic tests readily available to neurologists, such as 
      tests for ammonia, plasma amino acids, and urine organic acids. The limitations of 
      these tests are also discussed, as they only screen for a subset of the many inborn 
      errors of metabolism that exist. RECENT FINDINGS: Advances in next-generation 
      sequencing and the emerging use of advanced metabolomic screening have made it 
      possible to diagnose treatable inborn errors of metabolism that are not included in 
      current newborn screening programs. Some of these inborn errors of metabolism are 
      especially likely to present with nonspecific neurologic phenotypes, such as 
      epilepsy, ataxia, or intellectual disability. However, cost may be a barrier to 
      obtaining these newer tests. It is important to keep in mind that common metabolic 
      testing may lead to treatable diagnoses. Resources are available to guide 
      neurologists in diagnosing genetic metabolic conditions. SUMMARY: This article 
      introduces the clinical presentations of treatable inborn errors of metabolism that 
      are important for neurologists to consider in patients of all ages. Inborn errors of 
      metabolism are rare, but they can present with neurologic symptoms. Newborns are now 
      screened for many treatable metabolic disorders, but these screening tests may miss 
      milder presentations of treatable inborn errors of metabolism that present later in 
      life. These patients may present to adult neurologists who may be less likely to 
      consider metabolic genetic testing.

PG  - 1395-9
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.a.35361 [doi]
AB  - Interstitial deletions of the long arm of chromosome 6 are rare. Clinically, this is 
      a recognizable microdeletion syndrome associated with intellectual disability (ID), 
      acquired microcephaly, typical dysmorphic features, structural anomalies of the 
      brain, and nonspecific multiple organ anomalies. Most of the reported cases have 
      cytogenetically visible interstitial deletions or subtelomeric microdeletions. We 
      report on a boy with global developmental delay, distinct dysmorphic features, 
      dysgenesis of the corpus callosum, limb anomalies, and genital hypoplasia who has a 
      small interstitial deletion of the long arm of chromosome 6 detected by comparative 
      genomic hybridization (CGH). The deleted region spans around 1 Mb of DNA and 
      contains only two coding genes, ARID1B and ZDHHC14. To the best of our knowledge, 
      this case represents the typical phenotype with the smallest deletion reported so 
      far. We discuss the possible role of these genes in the phenotypic manifestations.

TI  - Neuropsychiatric perspectives on nodding syndrome in northern Uganda: a case series 
      study and a review of the literature.
PG  - 205-18
LID - 10.4314/ahs.v13i2.3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nodding Syndrome (NS), previously called Nodding Disease, is a chronic 
      and debilitating illness affecting thousands of children aged 3-18 years in 
      post-conflict Northern Uganda and South Sudan. Characterised by malnutrition, 
      stunted growth, mental retardation and seizures, some researchers have designated it 
      as epilepsy. With reports appearing in Northern Uganda in1997, NS reached epidemic 
      proportions around 2000-2003 when people were moved into Internally Displaced 
      People's (IDP) camps. Investigations for infections (onchocerciasis) and toxins have 
      been inconclusive as to cause, treatment or outcome. No study has addressed the 
      possible relationship of NS to childhood war-trauma experiences. OBJECTIVE: To 
      explore a possible relationship of exposure to prolonged war-trauma and the 
      emergence of epidemic NS in Northern Uganda. METHOD: This study was a case-series 
      descriptive psychiatric naturalistic field observations of NS cases from homesteads 
      in Northern Uganda and psychiatric investigations and treatment of NS cases referred 
      to Mulago National Referral and Teaching Hospital. RESULTS: Detailed Psychiatric 
      clinical evaluations and field observations revealed that NS children had been 
      exposed to severe war-related psychological and physical trauma as well as 
      non-specific CNS insults including untreated CNS infections/infestations and 
      malnutrition possibly causing seizures. Many children suffered post-traumatic stress 
      disorder (PTSD) and depression. CONCLUSION: NS could present as an association of 
      childhood complex PTSD, (called Developmental Trauma Disorder), occurring in the 
      chronically war-traumatised children of Northern Uganda, complicated by severe 
      prolonged depression with its characteristic symptoms of psychomotor retardation, 
      anxiety, anhedonia and anorexia. This, coupled with food shortages, resulted in 
      malnutrition, wasting and stunted growth with severe avitaminoses. Many children had 
      seizures. All this calls for multi-disciplinary treatment approaches.

TI  - Epidemiology and prevention of clinical and subclinical hypothyroidism.
PG  - 839-47
AB  - Iodine deficiency is the most common cause of hypothyroidism worldwide. In persons 
      living in iodine-replete areas, causes are congenital, spontaneous because of 
      chronic autoimmune disease (atrophic autoimmune thyroiditis or goitrous autoimmune 
      thyroiditis [Hashimoto's thyroiditis]), or iatrogenic because of goitrogens, drugs, 
      or destructive treatment for thyrotoxicosis. Screening for congenital hypothyroidism 
      exists and its use prevents mental retardation. The prevalence of spontaneous 
      hypothyroidism is between 1% and 2% and is more common in older women and 10 times 
      more common in women than in men. A significant proportion of subjects have 
      asymptomatic chronic autoimmune thyroiditis and 8% of women (10% of women over 55 
      years of age) and 3% of men have subclinical hypothyroidism. Approximately one third 
      of patients with newly diagnosed overt hypothyroidism have received destructive 
      therapy for hyperthyroidism and indefinite surveillance is required. There is not 
      much that can be done to prevent the occurrence of spontaneous autoimmune 
      hypothyroidism, but if identified early, something can be done to prevent 
      progression to overt disease. Controversy exists as to whether healthy adults would 
      benefit from screening for autoimmune thyroid disease because a significant 
      proportion of subjects tested will have evidence of mild thyroid failure. Case 
      finding in women at menopause or visiting a primary care physician with nonspecific 
      symptoms appears justified.

TI  - Cloning and mapping of members of the MYM family.
PG  - 244-7
AB  - Tandem repeats of a novel, putative, zinc-binding motif (MYM) have been described 
      within the products of two, highly homologous genes: ZNF198/RAMP/FIM and 
      ZNF261/DXS6673E. ZNF198, mapping to 13q11-q12, was recently shown to fuse to the 
      fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 gene in the t(8;13)(p11;q11-q12) rearrangement 
      associated with a stem cell leukemia/lymphoma syndrome. ZNF261 at Xq13.1 is 
      disrupted by a t(X;13)(q13.1;q32) rearrangement in a mentally retarded patient and 
      is a candidate gene for nonspecific X-linked mental retardation. Here we have cloned 
      another member of this family, designated ZNF258, and mapped it to chromosome band 
      14q12. In addition, ZNF262/KIAA0425 was identified as a further member of the family 
      and mapped to 1p32-p34. The predicted protein products of ZNF258 and ZNF262 maintain 
      the repeats of the MYM motif. Isolation of these new members will facilitate the 
      functional characterization of the MYM family and motif.

TI  - Acute necrotising encephalopathy of childhood: a new syndrome presenting with 
      multifocal, symmetric brain lesions.
PG  - 555-61
AB  - The clinicopathological features of a previously unrecognised type of acute 
      encephalopathy prevalent among Japanese children is described by reviewing the 
      records of 13 consecutive patients treated and 28 previously reported cases. The 
      hallmark of this encephalopathy, proposed to be a novel entity termed acute 
      necrotising encephalopathy of childhood, is multiple, necrotic brain lesions showing 
      a symmetric distribution. The encephalopathy was noted in previously healthy 
      children after respiratory tract infections, with presenting symptoms of coma, 
      convulsions, vomiting, hyperpyrexia, and hepatomegaly. Laboratory examinations 
      disclosed liver dysfunction, uraemia, and hypoproteinaemia. The histological 
      appearance of the liver was variable and non-specific. Cerebrospinal fluid contained 
      an increased amount of protein. Computed tomography and MRI showed the presence of 
      symmetrically distributed brain lesions of the thalamus, cerebral white matter, 
      brainstem, and cerebellum. Necropsy examination confirmed extensive fresh necrosis 
      of these regions with evidence of local breakdown of the blood-brain barrier. Based 
      on the characteristic combination of clinical and pathological findings, acute 
      necrotising encephalopathy of childhood can be distinguished from previously known 
      encephalopathies, including Reye's syndrome.

TI  - Abuse of alcohol, drugs and tobacco during pregnancy--consequences for the child.
PG  - 228-42
AB  - There is an increasing awareness that alcohol and drug abuse and smoking are not 
      only harmful for the consumer but will also, when taken by a pregnant woman, 
      adversely affect her unborn child. The consequence of the abuse will result from a 
      combination of specific toxic effects of abusing substances and a nonspecific effect 
      from the often very unstable environment of an alcohol- or drug-dependent mother. 
      Poor prenatal care is a common finding in alcohol and drug abuse leading to a high 
      incidence of complications during pregnancy and delivery including premature labor 
      and small-for-gestational-age babies. An increased perinatal mortality has been 
      reported following all types of abuse including tobacco use, probably as a 
      consequence of poor prenatal care as well as of a toxic effect on the fetus. 
      Withdrawal symptoms after birth are most prominent in opiate addiction. The already 
      intrauterinely damaged child will if it stays with its parents often continue to be 
      exposed to several abverse environmental factors. However, symptoms such as mental 
      retardation following alcohol abuse and hyperactivity and emotional disturbances 
      following drug exposure during intrauterine life have also been found in children 
      who have been taken from the parents and placed in foster homes immediately after 
      birth. This means that children of abusing parents both in their custody and in 
      foster home will have to be regarded as risk children that should be subjected to 
      careful medical and psychological follow-up.

TI  - The mouse Arhgef6 gene: cDNA sequence, expression analysis, and chromosome 
      assignment.
PG  - 196-201
AB  - Mutations in ARHGEF6, encoding a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rho GTPases, 
      have been shown to cause X-chromosomal non-specific mental retardation (MRX) in 
      human. Here we report the identification and characterization of the orthologous 
      mouse gene, Arhgef6. The gene transcript of approximately 4.4 kb is present in 
      various mouse tissues indicating ubiquitous expression as found for human ARHGEF6. 
      The open reading frame encodes a polypeptide of 771 amino acids with high homology 
      to human ARHGEF6. The structural motifs of both proteins are conserved including an 
      N-terminal CH domain, followed by an SH3 domain, and a tandem organization of the DH 
      and PH domains. Analysis of the temporal expression pattern revealed that Arhgef6 is 
      strongly expressed in the very early embryo and somewhat less in later stages. A 
      genomic cosmid clone containing Arhgef6 exons 1 and 2 has been isolated and used for 
      mapping the gene on the mouse X chromosome.

AB  - MED13L syndrome is a rare congenital disorder comprising moderate intellectual 
      disability, hypotonia and facial dysmorphism. Whole exome or genome sequencing in 
      patients with non-specific neurodevelopmental disorders leads to identification of 
      an increasing number of MED13L missense variations of unknown signification. The aim 
      of our study was to identify relevant annotation parameters enhancing discrimination 
      between candidate pathogenic or neutral missense variations, and to assess the 
      performance of seven meta-predictor algorithms: BayesDel, CADD, DANN, FATHMM-XF, 
      M-CAP, MISTIC and REVEL for the classification of MED13L missense variants. 
      Significant differences were identified for five parameters: global conservation 
      through verPhyloP and verPhCons scores; physico-chemical difference between amino 
      acids estimated by Grantham scores; conservation of residues between MED13L and 
      MED13 protein; proximity to phosphorylation sites for pathogenic variations. Among 
      the seven selected in-silico tools, BayesDel, REVEL, and MISTIC provided the most 
      interesting performances to discriminate pathogenic from neutral missense 
      variations. Individual gene parameter studies with MED13L have provided expertise on 
      elements of annotation improving meta-predictor choices. The in-silico approach 
      allows us to make valuable hypotheses to predict the involvement of these amino 
      acids in MED13L pathogenic missense variations.

AB  - Joubert syndrome (JBTS) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by 
      intellectual disability, hypotonia, ataxia, tachypnea/apnea, and abnormal eye 
      movements. A pathognomonic midbrain-hindbrain malformation seen on cranial magnetic 
      resonance imaging (MRI), which consists of hypoplasia of the midline cerebellar 
      vermis that resembles the cross-section through a molar tooth, has been described 
      previously. The molar tooth sign is defined by a peculiar appearance resembling a 
      molar tooth secondary to an abnormally deep interpeduncular fossa and enlarged 
      superior cerebellar peduncles on axial images at the pontomesencephalic level. The 
      term Joubert Syndrome and Related Disorders (JSRD) has recently been adopted to 
      describe all disorders presenting the "molar tooth sign" (MTS) on brain imaging. 
      JSRD is characterized by lack of decussation of the superior cerebellar peduncles, 
      central pontine tracts and corticospinal tracts suggesting defective axon guidance. 
      Prenatal sonographic findings in fetuses with JSRD are relatively nonspecific and 
      include increased nuchal translucency, enlarged cisterna magna, cerebellar vermian 
      agenesis, occipital encephalocele, ventriculomegaly and polydactyly. We report a 
      case of JSRD detected prenatally at 23 weeks of gestation. The fetus in the present 
      case had a normal karyotype. Sonographic features of the fetus included polydactyly, 
      partial vermian hypoplasia, dilated 4(th) ventricle and mild ventriculomegaly which 
      were also confirmed by prenatal MRI. MTS was demonstrated in a postnatal MRI after 
      pregnancy termination.

TI  - Pathogenic WDFY3 variants cause neurodevelopmental disorders and opposing effects on 
      brain size.
PG  - 2617-2630
LID - 10.1093/brain/awz198 [doi]
AB  - The underpinnings of mild to moderate neurodevelopmental delay remain elusive, often 
      leading to late diagnosis and interventions. Here, we present data on exome and 
      genome sequencing as well as array analysis of 13 individuals that point to 
      pathogenic, heterozygous, mostly de novo variants in WDFY3 (significant de novo 
      enrichment P = 0.003) as a monogenic cause of mild and non-specific 
      neurodevelopmental delay. Nine variants were protein-truncating and four missense. 
      Overlapping symptoms included neurodevelopmental delay, intellectual disability, 
      macrocephaly, and psychiatric disorders (autism spectrum disorders/attention deficit 
      hyperactivity disorder). One proband presented with an opposing phenotype of 
      microcephaly and the only missense-variant located in the PH-domain of WDFY3. 
      Findings of this case are supported by previously published data, demonstrating that 
      pathogenic PH-domain variants can lead to microcephaly via canonical Wnt-pathway 
      upregulation. In a separate study, we reported that the autophagy scaffolding 
      protein WDFY3 is required for cerebral cortical size regulation in mice, by 
      controlling proper division of neural progenitors. Here, we show that proliferating 
      cortical neural progenitors of human embryonic brains highly express WDFY3, further 
      supporting a role for this molecule in the regulation of prenatal neurogenesis. We 
      present data on Wnt-pathway dysregulation in Wdfy3-haploinsufficient mice, which 
      display macrocephaly and deficits in motor coordination and associative learning, 
      recapitulating the human phenotype. Consequently, we propose that in humans WDFY3 
      loss-of-function variants lead to macrocephaly via downregulation of the Wnt 
      pathway. In summary, we present WDFY3 as a novel gene linked to mild to moderate 
      neurodevelopmental delay and intellectual disability and conclude that variants 
      putatively causing haploinsufficiency lead to macrocephaly, while an opposing 
      pathomechanism due to variants in the PH-domain of WDFY3 leads to microcephaly.

TI  - A chromosomal deletion map of human malformations.
PG  - 1153-9
AB  - Malformations are common causes of pediatric morbidity and mortality, and genetic 
      factors are a significant component of their etiology. Autosomal deletions, in 
      almost all cases, cause a nonspecific embryopathy that presents after birth as 
      growth failure, mental retardation, and multiple malformations. We have constructed 
      a chromosome map of autosomal deletions associated with 47 different congenital 
      malformations, using detailed clinical and cytogenetic information on 1,753 patients 
      with nonmosaic single contiguous autosomal deletions. The 1,753 deletions involved 
      258 (89%) of 289 possible autosomal bands (by the use of ISCN 400-band 
      nomenclature), giving a total of 4,190 deleted autosomal bands for analysis. We 
      compared the band distributions of deletions associated with common major 
      malformations with the distribution of all 1,753 deletions. We noted 283 positive 
      associations between deleted bands and specific malformations, of which 199 were 
      significant (P<.05, P>.001) and 84 were highly significant (P<.001). These 
      "malformation-associated bands" (MABs) were distributed among 137 
      malformation-associated chromosome regions (MACRs). An average of 6 MABs in 2.9 
      MACRs were detected per malformation studied; 18 (6%) of 283 MABs contain a locus 
      known to be associated with the particular malformation. A further 18 (6%) of 283 
      are in seven recognized specific malformation-associated aneuploid regions. 
      Therefore, 36 (26%) of 137 of the MACRs contain an MAB coinciding with a previously 
      recognized locus or malformation-associated aneuploid region. This map should 
      facilitate identification of genes important in human development.

TI  - [A patient with Joubert syndrome who developed sleep-related breathing disorder at 
      15 years of age].
PG  - 430-3
AB  - Joubert syndrome is characterized by neonatal breathing disorders that are thought 
      to improve with age, but recent findings indicate that sleep-related breathing 
      disorders can occur even after infancy. A 15-year-old boy who had a breathing 
      disorder during the neonatal period developed mental retardation and hypotonia. He 
      was diagnosed with Joubert syndrome based on the clinical course and molar tooth 
      sign on brain MRI at 9 years of age. Daytime sleepiness developed at 15 years of 
      age. An interview and the results of sleep questionnaires (Epworth sleepiness scale, 
      Pediatric sleep questionnaire and Pittsburgh sleep quality index), indicated that 
      the patient had daytime sleepiness and a sleep-related breathing disorder. Overnight 
      polysomnography showed central apnea with an apnea hypopnea index of 16, indicating 
      that the patient had central sleep apnea syndrome. After nighttime oxygen therapy at 
      home for one month, the sleep questionnaires showed improved daytime sleepiness and 
      the sleep-related breathing disorder. The improvement persisted for over 12 months 
      thereafter. Sleep-related breathing disorders could be indicated by non-specific 
      complaints such as daytime sleepiness and lead to appropriate therapies. Such 
      disorders should be considered as a complication of Joubert syndrome even after 
      infancy.

TI  - Neuropsychiatric Symptoms in Inborn Errors of Metabolism: Incorporation of Genomic 
      and Metabolomic Analysis into Therapeutics and Prevention.
PG  - 65-70
AB  - Inborn errors of metabolism may present as a spectrum ranging from neonatal 
      lethality to non-specific symptoms. Neuropsychiatric manifestations have been 
      identified in three groups: those presenting as emergencies, those with chronic 
      fluctuating symptoms, and those associated with mental retardation. Milder central 
      nervous system specific inborn errors of metabolism may also present later in life 
      with isolated psychiatric symptoms. Inborn errors of metabolism presenting with 
      neuropsychiatric symptoms are described with illustrative case examples. Metabolomic 
      and genomic approaches to identification and treatment are described.

TI  - Factitial oral lesions in an autistic paediatric patient.
PG  - 130-7
AB  - Self Injurious Behaviour (SIB) is a deliberate harm to the body that may lead to 
      factitial injuries. Its origin may be functional or biological and it has a higher 
      prevalence in females and in psychologically impaired individuals. Seventy per cent 
      of autistic patients have SIB. Seventy-five per cent of factitial injuries are 
      located in the head and neck region. A paediatric case report concerning a 
      4-year-old autistic female is presented. Detailed medical history, physical 
      examination, clinical intraoral and radiographic examination, incisional biopsy, 
      neuropaediatrical, psychological and speech evaluation were undertaken. Diagnosis 
      included hypochromic macrocytic anaemia, caries, coronal fracture, factitial ulcer, 
      factitial periodontitis, self-extraction of primary teeth and permanent teeth buds, 
      non-specific oral ulcer with inflammatory reaction, mild mental retardation, speech 
      impairment, autistic syndrome and self injurious behaviour consisting of putting 
      fingers and foreign objects in the gingiva, fingernail biting and hair pulling. 
      Differential diagnosis included hystiocitosis X, prepuberal periodontitis and 
      leukocyte adhesion deficiency. Dental preventive and restorative treatment was 
      performed. Non-contingent reinforcement therapy was successfully used to diminish 
      SIB. Treatment of factitial oral injuries must be interdisciplinary and requires 
      cooperation of the patient, the parents, health care providers, and medical team.

TI  - Prospective evaluation of esophageal motor dysfunction in Down's syndrome.
PG  - 1718-24
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and way of 
      presentation of esophageal motor dysfunction in a nonselected population of subjects 
      with Down's syndrome. METHODS: The study was conducted in 58 Down's syndrome 
      patients and 38 healthy controls. A global symptom score and individual scores for 
      dysphagia for liquids and solids, heartburn, vomiting/regurgitation, and chest pain 
      were obtained. Esophageal function was evaluated initially by scintigraphy using 
      liquid and semisolid bolus. Time-activity curves based on the mean condensed images 
      were used to calculate residual activity at 100 s after swallowing. According to 
      both scintigraphy and clinical evaluation results, participants underwent a 
      radiological and manometric study. RESULTS: The most frequent symptoms in Down's 
      syndrome patients were: dysphagia for liquids (n = 9), dysphagia for solids (n = 
      10), vomiting/regurgitation (n = 8), and chest pain (n = 2). Liquid and semisolid 
      retention of the tracer was significantly higher in Down's syndrome patients than in 
      controls (p < 0.05). In 15 participants with Down's syndrome, tracer retention was 
      higher than the 95 percentile of controls' retention. No correlation was found 
      between the global or individual symptom score and esophageal retention quantified 
      by scintigraphy. Hypothyroidism was unrelated to esophageal symptoms or retention. 
      Five of the 15 esophagograms performed were abnormal, showing barium retention 
      and/or esophageal dilation. Manometry showed achalasia in two subjects, total body 
      aperistalsis in one, and nonspecific esophageal motor disorder in two. CONCLUSION: 
      Esophageal motor disorders, particularly achalasia, are frequent in individuals with 
      Down's syndrome. Awareness of esophageal dysmotility in this population is 
      important, even though symptoms are not evident, to avoid potential complications.

TI  - "Tandem" duplication of 4p16.1p16.3 chromosome region associated with 4p16.3pter 
      molecular deletion resulting in Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome phenotype.
PG  - 371-5
AB  - Chromosome imbalance affecting the short arm of chromosome 4 results in a variety of 
      distinct clinical conditions. Most of them share a number of manifestations, such as 
      mental retardation, microcephaly, pre- and post-natal growth retardation, anteverted 
      and low-set ears, that can be considered as nonspecific signs, generally 
      attributable to gene dosage impairment. On the other hand, more distinctive 
      phenotypic traits correlate with the segmental aneuploidy. Duplications of the 
      distal half of 4p give rise to the partial trisomy 4 syndrome, characterized by a 
      "boxer" nose configuration and deep-set eyes. These signs are usually observed even 
      in cases of small terminal duplications. Haploinsufficiency of 4p16.3 results in the 
      so-called Wolf-Hirschhorn (WH) syndrome, a contiguous gene syndrome characterized by 
      maxillary hypoplasia, large and protruding eyes, high nasal bridge, skeletal 
      abnormalities, and midline defects. The smallest overlapping deletion described so 
      far as a cause of this condition is only 165 kb long, suggesting that one or a few 
      genes in this region act as "master" regulators of different developmental pathways. 
      A "tandem" duplication of 4p16.1p16.3 was detected in association with a subtle 
      deletion of 4p16.3pter on the same chromosome in a patient with the WH phenotype. 
      The 3.2 Mb deletion, spanning the genomic region from the vicinity of D4S43 to the 
      telomere, encompasses the recently delimited "WHS critical region" [Wright et al., 
      1997: Hum. Mol. Genet. 6:317-324]. This unusual chromosome rearrangement resulted in 
      WH phenotype, clinical manifestations of partial 4p trisomy being mild or absent. 
      This observation led us to speculate that the regulatory gene/genes in the critical 
      WH region affect the expression of other genes in a dose-dependent manner. 
      Haploinsufficiency of this region could be more deleterious than various partial 
      trisomies.

      chronic arthropathy and contractures.
PG  - 938-42
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.a.33359 [doi]
AB  - We report on two siblings doubly heterozygous for null mutations in the recently 
      identified AGS5 gene SAMHD1. The older female child showed mild intellectual 
      disability with microcephaly. Her brother demonstrated a significant spastic 
      paraparesis with normal intellect and head size. Both children had an unclassified 
      chronic inflammatory skin condition with chilblains, and recurrent mouth ulcers. One 
      child had a chronic progressive deforming arthropathy of the small and large joints, 
      with secondary contractures. This family illustrate the remarkable phenotypic 
      diversity accruing from mutations in genes associated with Aicardi-Goutières 
      syndrome (AGS). The association of arthropathy with SAMHD1 mutations highlights a 
      phenotypic overlap of AGS with familial autoinflammatory disorders such as chronic 
      infantile neurological cutaneous and articular syndrome (CINCA). This family 
      therefore illustrate the need to consider mutation analysis of SAMHD1 in 
      non-specific inflammatory phenotypes of childhood. We propose that arthropathy with 
      progressive contractures should now be considered part of the spectrum of 
      Aicardi-Goutières syndrome because of SAMHD1 mutations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome is a group of heterogeneous 
      diseases with non-specific presentation. The common feature is the quantitative 
      depletion of mitochondrial DNA without qualitative defects. Diagnosis of these 
      diseases poses a challenge and whole exome sequencing is often needed for their 
      diagnoses. CASE: Two siblings of a quartet family, presenting with hypotonia, 
      microcephaly and severe intellectual disability, have been diagnosed to harbor two 
      heterozygous variants in trans in the DTYMK gene of the thymidine biosynthesis 
      pathway. Mitochondrial DNA depletion has been demonstrated in silico in the more 
      severe sibling. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest the consideration of incorporating DTYMK as 
      one of the associated genes of mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome (MDDS). DTYMK 
      may be the missing link in the mitochondrial nucleotide salvage pathway but further 
      characterization and additional evidence would be needed.

TI  - Danon Disease Due to a Novel LAMP2 Microduplication.
PG  - 11-6
LID - 10.1007/8904_2013_277 [doi]
AB  - Danon disease is a rare X-linked disorder comprising hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, 
      skeletal myopathy, intellectual disability, and retinopathy; mutations of the 
      lysosome-associated membrane protein gene LAMP2 are responsible. Most affected 
      persons exhibit "private" point mutations; small locus rearrangements have recently 
      been reported in four cases. Here, we describe the clinical, pathologic, and 
      molecular features of a male proband and his affected mother with Danon disease and 
      a small LAMP2 microduplication. The proband presented at age 12 years with exercise 
      intolerance, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and increased creatine kinase. 
      Endomyocardial biopsy findings were nonspecific, showing myocyte hypertrophy and 
      reactive mitochondrial changes. Quadriceps muscle biopsy demonstrated the 
      characteristic autophagic vacuoles with sarcolemma-like features. LAMP2 tissue 
      immunostaining was absent; however, LAMP2 sequencing was normal. 
      Deletion/duplication testing by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification 
      (MLPA) assay revealed a 1.5kb microduplication containing LAMP2 exons 4 and 5. 
      RT-PCR studies were consistent with the inclusion of these two duplicated exons in 
      the final spliced transcript, resulting in a frameshift. The proband's mother, who 
      had died following cardiac transplantation due to suspected myocarditis at age 35, 
      was reviewed and was shown to be affected upon immunostaining of banked myocardial 
      tissue. This case constitutes the second report of a pathogenic microduplication in 
      Danon disease, and illustrates a number of potential diagnostic pitfalls. Firstly, 
      given the imperfect sensitivity of LAMP2 sequencing, tissue immunostaining and/or 
      MLPA should be considered as a diagnostic adjunct in the workup for this disorder. 
      Secondly, the pathological findings in myocardium may be falsely indicative of 
      relatively common conditions such as myocarditis.

TI  - Hypothalamic hamartoma with gelastic seizures in Swedish children and adolescents.
PG  - 35-44
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypothalamic hamartoma with gelastic seizures (HHGS) is an uncommon, 
      often unrecognized, epileptic syndrome with onset of symptoms during childhood. AIM: 
      In order to study the occurrence, clinical symptoms and different investigations of 
      HHGS in Swedish children and adolescents, a nationwide survey was undertaken. 
      Methods. Twelve patients, three females, aged 5 to 19 years were identified and 
      their hospital records reviewed. MRI examinations were reinvestigated. RESULTS: 
      Gelastic seizures were noted before the age of six months in seven patients in at 
      least three as early as the neonatal period. During the course of disease one or 
      more other seizure types developed in 11 patients. Behaviour disorder became 
      subsequently obvious in ten patients, and mental retardation was diagnosed in seven. 
      Precocious puberty was diagnosed in five patients. A total of 46 MRI examinations 
      were performed in 11 patients, revealing hypothalamic tumors, eight of which were 
      drooping with a broad base. Interictal and ictal EEG examinations were pathological 
      in 10 patients with nonspecific results. Nonspecific results were also found on 
      SPECT and PET performed in six and two patients, respectively. Available 
      antiepileptic drugs had little or no effect on gelastic seizures, but some effect on 
      other seizure types. Precocious puberty was treated with a GnRH-agonist. 
      Neurosurgical treatment of the hypothalamic hamartoma, performed in three patients, 
      had a rather good outcome concerning gelastic seizures and behaviour. Vagal nerve 
      stimulation in five patients had no effect. CONCLUSIONS: Review of the literature 
      and experience from this group's own cases confirms that early diagnosis of HHGS is 
      important. Hypothalamic hamartoma should be considered in any child with laughing 
      attacks. MRI investigation is compulsory, and neurosurgery the most important 
      treatment.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: and importance: WAGR syndrome is a rare genetic disorder consist of 
      Wilms tumor, Aniridia, Genitourinary abnormalities, and Intellectual disability. 
      During the enduring COVID-19 pandemic, it has become extremely important to document 
      the properties of SARS-CoV-2 and its interactions with other diseases. Herein, we 
      present the first case of Syrian child with WAGR syndrome that has been affected by 
      COVID-19. CASE PRESENTATION: a 17-month-old boy was diagnosed with WAGR syndrome. 
      During the follow-up, he developed rhinorrhea, cough, and moderate dyspnea with no 
      fever. Computed tomography scan was normal and polymerase chain reaction test was 
      positive. The child started an oxygen therapy with broad-spectrum antibiotics based 
      on laboratory findings. His vital signs and laboratory values improved gradually 
      without any further complications. DISCUSSION: COVID-19 has a special interest 
      regarding its course in children. Although the clinical presentation varies, the 
      current data reveal a better prognosis in children. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 infection 
      may result in non-specific symptoms and normal CT scan findings in children with 
      WAGR syndrome. The accurate diagnosis, effective isolation and monitoring of the 
      child, and successful management can improve the prognosis and shorten the infection 
      period.

AB  - Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the most common cause of intrauterine infection, occurring 
      in up to 2% of all live births. Most women are asymptomatic or experience 
      nonspecific symptoms, which can lead to long-term sequelae in newborns including 
      neurological impairment, hearing loss, and mental retardation. A 41-year-old woman 
      (G6 P2), with a medical history of epilepsy, presented for her routine anomaly scan 
      at 20 + 4/40. A single finding of echogenic bowel was noted on ultrasound which 
      prompted a full investigation. A repeat ultrasound only five days later demonstrated 
      progressive changes, which included bilateral ventriculomegaly with oedema of the 
      posterior ventricular wall, periventricular hyperechogenicity, and enlargement of 
      the cisterna magna. CMV DNA was detected at amniocentesis. Ultrasound findings are 
      not diagnostic for CMV with only 11-15% of at-risk fetuses being identified. 
      Unfortunately, these findings may be the only indication of an abnormality. There is 
      a well-documented lack of awareness surrounding CMV and screening is not routinely 
      offered. Given the risk to the pregnancy of CMV and to subsequent pregnancies, 
      simple education at the start of a pregnancy could significantly reduce the 
      incidence of maternal CMV.

TI  - [Autopsy cases of hereditary ataxia pathologically diagnosed as the Japanese type of 
      Joseph disease--cliniconeuropathological findings].
PG  - 161-83
AB  - Two cases (father and son) clinically diagnosed as Menzel type of heredoataxia were 
      examined pathologically, and found nonspecific, multisystem degenerations of central 
      nervous system spreading from brain stem to cerebellum and spinal cord. Common 
      neuropathological findings of both cases were marked neuronal loss, demyelination 
      and cellular and fibrous gliosis in pallidum (esp. internal segment), body of Luys, 
      substantia nigra, dentate nucleus, red nucleus, cranial and spinal motor nuclei, 
      spinocerebellar tracts and Clarke's column. There were no abnormalities in cerebral 
      cortex, caudate nucleus, putamen, thalamus and inferior olive nucleus. These 
      findings had enough similarity to that of Japanese type of Joseph disease. The son 
      who died 36 years old had showed clinically hyperreflexia, cerebellar ataxia, 
      dystonic extrapyramidal movement, muscle atrophy and bulging eyes. Dominant 
      pathological findings compared to the father case were neuronal loss of substantia 
      nigra and red nucleus, fibrous gliosis of superior peduncles and grumose 
      degeneration of dentate nucleus. The father case died 76 years old had showed 
      hyporeflexia, cerebellar ataxia and no bulging eyes clinically. The pathologica 
      findings of pallidum, cranial and spinal motor nuclei, dorsal column and 
      spinocerebellar tracts were more dominant than the other reported case. Dementia, 
      mental retardation, epileptic episodes were not found in this family pedigree. 
      Pathological changes of pallidonigral, pallidoluysian, dentatorubral and spinal cord 
      which were common in Japanese type were less found in original type of Joseph 
      disease in Europe. Authors discussed this difference in relation with progressive 
      pallidumatrophy, dentato-rubro-pallido-luisian atrophy and hereditary spastic 
      ataxia. According to the classification of clinical feature of Joseph disease in 
      Europe, the father case was classified as type III (Machado phenotype) and the son 
      case was as type I (Joseph phenotype). Reported cases of type III and familial 
      autopsy cases of Joseph disease were so rare in Japan, authors reported on their 
      clinicopathological findings.

TI  - DXS6673E encodes a predominantly nuclear protein, and its mouse ortholog DXHXS6673E 
      is alternatively spliced in a developmental- and tissue-specific manner.
PG  - 123-32
AB  - DXS6673E is a candidate gene for nonspecific X-linked mental retardation and encodes 
      a novel Zn-finger protein. The ortholog murine gene DXHXS6673E in XC-D was isolated 
      and characterized. It is ubiquitously expressed in all embryonic stages and adult 
      tissues. Two different transcription start sites exist that result in two major 
      transcripts of 6055 and 5352 nucleotides, each composed of 25 exons. Exon 1A is 
      tissue specific, whereas exon 1B is transcribed constitutively. Both variants are 
      translated into the same 1370-amino-acid protein. Transcripts are subject to 
      alternative splicing at the 5'-end. Some of the isoforms are developmental stage and 
      tissue specific. Among them, one was present only in embryos and adult brain. 
      Sequence analysis demonstrated evolutionary conservation down to the arthropods and 
      defined several conserved protein motifs. Subcellular localization studies with 
      green fluorescent protein as a reporter showed that DXS6673E is predominantly 
      located in the nucleus due to several functional nuclear localization signals. Three 
      distinct protein distribution patterns in COS-7 cells could be identified.

TI  - Dextromethorphan in nonketotic hyperglycinaemia: metabolic variation confounds the 
      dose-response relationship.
PG  - 28-38
AB  - Nonketotic hyperglycinaemia (NKH) is an inborn error of the glycine cleavage system 
      resulting in seizures and mental retardation. Two prior reports noted an 
      anticonvulsant effect from high-dose dextromethorphan (DM) in this disorder, 
      although the two reported patients demonstrated widely disparate DM requirements and 
      drug levels. We report two children with NKH who also demonstrated disparate and 
      variable DM metabolism which markedly influenced the dose-concentration-response 
      relationship. Levels of DM and its primary metabolite dextrorphan (DX) were utilized 
      to guide DM therapy and exhibited patterns reflective of the extensive and poor 
      metabolizer phenotypes for CYP2D6, the cytochrome P450 isoform responsible for DM 
      metabolism. In the patient who appeared to represent the extensive metabolizer (EM) 
      phenotype, treatment with the non-specific cytochrome P450 inhibitor cimetidine was 
      required to reduce biotransformation of DM to DX and, thus, to increase DM plasma 
      concentrations. In the patient with the apparent poor metabolizer (PM) phenotype, a 
      change in the DM preparation to a sustained-release form and increase in the dosing 
      interval was required to lower DM plasma concentrations. These cases demonstrate the 
      importance of CYP2D6 phenotype in providing safe and effective DM therapy to 
      patients with NKH.

TI  - Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease: two case report and literature review.
PG  - 293-296
LID - 10.1007/s10072-020-04613-0 [doi]
AB  - Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) is a rare and slowly progressing 
      neurodegenerative disease characterized by the presence of eosinophilic intranuclear 
      inclusions in the nervous system and multiple visceral organs. Sporadic NIID case 
      was more frequently encountered than familial. In our study, we reported two 
      adult-onset NIID patients from a family and described their clinical, imaging, and 
      pathological features. The first patient was a 61-year-old man who only presented 
      with non-specific headache and dizziness; however, Brain MRI with diffusion-weighted 
      images (DWI) sequence showed high-intensity signal involving a small regional 
      portion of corticomedullary junction in the frontal and parietal lobe. The older 
      sister of former, a 64-year-old female, who developed sudden onset of weakness of 
      the right limb was admitted to our neurology department. Compared with the first 
      patient, similar DWI high-intensity signal but more extensive area in the 
      corticomedullary junction was found in her brain MRI examination, also prominent 
      leukoencephalopathy in T2-weighted image. Significantly, skin pathology of the first 
      patient showed that typical inclusions with strongly positive P62 and ubiquitin 
      antibody could be seen in the nuclei of sweat gland cells, adipocytes, and 
      fibroblasts. FMR1 gene was negative. Although rare, adult-onset NIID should be 
      considered when the characteristic radiology changes of high intensity signal 
      involving the corticomedullary junction in the brain DWI sequence was found. In 
      addition, the pathological result of skin biopsy combined with negative genetic 
      testing FMR1 or NOTCH2NLC can contribute to the accurate diagnosis of the disease. 
      This article aims to improve the radiologists' knowledge of NIID by our cases 
      presentation and reviewing literature.

TI  - [Basal ganglia calcification on computed tomography: clinical characteristics in 25 
      patients].
PG  - 104-7
AB  - Twenty-five patients presenting basal ganglia calcification were assessed. This 
      finding comprised 0.68% of all skull CT scan carried out during the period. Two 
      patients were neurologically asymptomatic and 23 presented a variety neurological 
      disorders--headache (7 patients), stroke (5 patients), extrapyramidal syndromes (2 
      patients), tumor (2 patients), epilepsy (1 patient), mental retardation (1 patient), 
      dementia (1 patient), cranial trauma (1 patient), other neurological conditions (3 
      patients)--or were asymptomatic from the neurological point of view (2 patients). 
      Findings in the CT scan other than the basal ganglia calcification were observed in 
      15 (60%) patients. There was a clinical-CT scan correlation in these cases but not 
      in those in which the basal ganglia calcification was an isolated finding. This 
      study highlights the fact that basal ganglia calcification is often a nonspecific 
      finding on CT scan and that it may not be possible to establish a 
      clinical-pathological correlation between them.

TI  - Intractable infant diarrhea associated with phenotypic abnormalities and 
      immunodeficiency.
PG  - 36-42
AB  - We report on eight children with severe diarrhea beginning in the first 6 months of 
      life (< 1 month in six cases), who had a number of features in common. All were 
      small for gestational age and had an abnormal phenotype, including facial 
      dysmorphism, hypertelorism, and woolly, easily removable hair with trichorhexis 
      nodosa. Two were products of consanguineous marriages. Severe secretory diarrhea 
      persisted despite bowel rest (n = 7). Jejunal biopsy specimens showed total or 
      subtotal villous atrophy with crypt necrosis, and inconstant T-cell activation in 
      some cases (n = 3). Colon biopsy specimens showed moderate nonspecific colitis. All 
      the patients had defective antibody responses despite normal serum immunoglobulin 
      levels, and defective antigen-specific skin tests despite positive proliferative 
      responses in vitro. Three had monoclonal hyper-immunoglobulinemia A. The course was 
      marked by diffuse erythroderma in two cases and mental retardation in three. 
      Treatment included bowel rest, intravenous administration of immune globulins, 
      administration of corticosteroids (n = 6) and cyclosporine (n = 2), and bone marrow 
      transplantation (n = 1). Five patients died between the ages of 2 and 5 years (of 
      sepsis or cirrhosis), two are being fed enterally, and one continues to receive 
      total parenteral nutrition. The cause of the combined low birth weight, dysmorphism, 
      severe diarrhea, trichorrhexis, and immunodeficiency is unclear. These features may 
      constitute a specific syndrome within the group of intractable diarrheas of infancy.

TI  - [Spinal epidural abscess as the cause of torticollis--diagnosis by magnetic 
      resonance imaging].
PG  - 49-53
AB  - Spinal epidural abscesses are rare, accounting for only 0.2-1.2 of every 10,000 
      hospital admissions. Because they often present with non-specific symptoms, they are 
      frequently misdiagnosed. We present a case in which superconduction MRI was used to 
      make the diagnosis and to follow the clinical course of a spinal epidural abscess. 
      In December 1988, a 33-year-old male developed spiking fever and the sudden onset of 
      torticollis. He had had a cerebral palsy from birth, with chronic tetraparesis and 
      mental retardation. Isolation of staphylococcus aureus in urine and blood cultures 
      confirmed the diagnosis of pyelonephritis and septicemia. A high fever persisted 
      despite antibiotic therapy commenced immediately. A technetium 99 m scan showed a 
      localized uptake of isotope in the cervical spine. An MRI examination performed in 
      the following day under sedation showed a mass with the same signal intensity as 
      muscle on T1-weighted images. It was located behind the vertebral bodies C1-Th1 
      compressing the spinal cord. In addition, a lesion with a decreased signal was also 
      evident in the C5-C6 vertebral bodies. Because of torticollis, the patient was 
      unable to keep his head still for a sufficient period of time, to obtain T2-weighted 
      imaging. The MRI findings indicated the presence of a spinal epidural abscess and 
      osteomyelitis. A second MRI done one month after admission showed a reduction in the 
      size of the epidural mass, but further diminishing of the signal intensity of the 
      vertebral lesion. One month later, the patient underwent the surgical removal of the 
      pus and inflammatory soft tissue, and anterior fusion. The torticollis resolved 
      following the operation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB  - INTRODUCTION AND IMPORTANCE: Acute bowel obstruction is a life-threatening 
      condition; late or incomplete management worsens the prognosis. Bezoars are a rare 
      etiology of this disease, and the diagnosis can be confusing. This study aims to 
      present and discuss a very rare case of concomitant bezoars. CASE PRESENTATION: We 
      report the case of a 22-year-old male with a history of mental retardation who was 
      admitted to the emergency department for acute intestinal obstruction with diffuse 
      abdominal guarding. Laboratory findings revealed a biological inflammatory syndrome 
      and an electrolyte imbalance. The abdominal X-ray was without abnormalities. 
      Intraoperatively, a phytobezoar in the jejunum was initially discovered. However, 
      the entire digestive tract's meticulous exploration discovered a concomitant 
      vegetable bezoar in the stomach. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: Phytobezoar obstruction is 
      very rare and usually located in the distal small bowel, related to the reduced 
      intraluminal diameter, the decreased mobility, and the higher water absorption in 
      this portion. The clinical presentation is non-specific and reflects acute 
      intestinal obstruction in the majority of cases. The abdominal CT-scan is useful for 
      diagnosis. However, Surgeons should not delay the intervention until they recognize 
      the etiology preoperatively because it is not always obvious. Besides, surgeons 
      should explore the entire gastrointestinal tract during the intervention; a second 
      phytobezoars' location is undoubtedly exceptional but exists, as evidenced by our 
      case. CONCLUSION: When phytobezoar obstruction, urgent care is required, and the 
      intraoperative exploration of the entire digestive tract is a simple gesture with 
      capital importance. It allows to prevent avoidable complications, especially a 
      second surgery.

TI  - Clinical Spectrum of Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia in Children: A study of 74 cases.
PG  - 371-9
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to explore the spectrum of hereditary spastic 
      paraplegia (HSP) in children in Oman. METHODS: This retrospective study was carried 
      out between January 1994 and August 2011 on children with delayed development, gait 
      disorders and motor handicaps, with signs of symmetrical pyramidal tract 
      involvement. A detailed perinatal and family history, including the age of onset of 
      symptoms, was recorded. The children were labelled as having either the pure or 
      complicated form of HSP based on the established diagnostic criteria. In families 
      with more than one affected child, parents and all other siblings were also 
      examined. RESULTS: Within the study, 74 children from 31 families were diagnosed 
      with HSP. Parental consanguinity was seen in 91% of cases, with 44 children (59.4%) 
      experiencing onset of the disease under one year of age. Complicated HSP was the 
      most common type, seen in 81.1%. Speech involvement, mental retardation, and 
      epilepsy were the most common associated abnormalities. Nonspecific white matter 
      changes and corpus callosum abnormalities were noted in 24.3% of cases on magnetic 
      resonance imaging. CONCLUSION: The study described clinical features of 74 children 
      with HSP. Autosomal recessive complicated HSP was seen in 81.1% of cases.

TI  - [Alternating hemiplegia of childhood in Spanish population. Study of a series of 17 
      patients].
PG  - 577-9
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Alternating hemiplegia of childhood (AHC) is a rare 
      disease of unknown etiology characterized by early onset of recurrent episodes of 
      hemiplegia, tonic or dystonic attacks and abnormal ocular movements with a fatal 
      outcome to severe encephalopathy. Our aim was to describe the clinical 
      manifestations, precipitating factors, complementary studies results, long-term 
      outcome and response to treatment in a series of AHC patients. PATIENTS AND METHOD: 
      Descriptive, retrospective and multicenter study in 17 Spanish patients aged between 
      1-24 years who fulfilled diagnostic criteria of AHC. RESULTS: Twelve cases fulfilled 
      criteria of typical AHC and 5 were atypical. Mean age at diagnosis was 26 months and 
      47% cases had a family history of migraine. Mean age at onset of hemiplegic attacks 
      was 9.3 months. Symptoms disappeared during sleep and precipitating factors were 
      present in 94% cases. Most patients developed mental retardation with ataxia and 
      dysarthria. Work-up tests (metabolic, neurophysiologic and radiologic) were normal 
      or nonspecific. In 3 patients mutations in CACNA1A, ATP1A2 were ruled out. Positive 
      responses to flunarizine was observed in 81%. CONCLUSIONS: The characteristic 
      clinical symptoms are still the clue to make the diagnosis of this disease, with a 
      lack of genetic, biochemical or radiological specific studies. Early diagnosis 
      avoids invasive tests, repeating procedures, using ineffective and potentially toxic 
      treatments, and allows to start treatment with flunarizine without delay. More 
      genetic studies are needed in broader series of patients.

TI  - Toxoplasmosis in pregnancy.
PG  - 107-37
AB  - Primary infection with Toxoplasma gondii in pregnant women occurs all over the world 
      with frequencies between 0.1-1%. In approximately 40% of the cases, the unborn child 
      is infected. The risk of fetal infection increases during pregnancy, while at the 
      same time the risk of severe disease decreases. As a result, infants with congenital 
      toxoplasmosis are mostly asymptomatic at birth, but long-term studies indicate that 
      up to 85% of them will develop sequelae including chorioretinitis (leading to severe 
      impairment of vision), hearing loss or mental retardation. Early recognition of 
      maternal infection and treatment with spiramycin or pyrimethamine-sulphadiazine will 
      reduce the parasitic colonization of the placenta by more than 60% and prevent 
      infection in the fetus. If fetal infection has already occurred, maternal treatment 
      modifies the fetal disease. Therapy during the first year of life improves the 
      prognosis. It is possible today to identify infected fetuses by prenatal diagnosis 
      based on detection of the parasite in cord blood, amniotic fluid and placental 
      tissue. Specific antibodies and non-specific signs of infection in fetal blood give 
      additional information. Advances in laboratory techniques have made it feasible to 
      consider serological surveillance of pregnant women. The present recommendation is 
      that each country should provide data on the incidence of toxoplasma infection in 
      pregnancy and thereby decide whether it represents a problem and what measures 
      should be adopted. This paper summarizes the present knowledge of the parasite and 
      its implication for the mother and unborn child. The effect and problems of primary 
      and secondary prevention in pregnancy are discussed as well as the efficacy of 
      treatment. The need for future research including long-term follow-up studies are 
      emphasized.

TI  - GRIN1 mutations cause encephalopathy with infantile-onset epilepsy, and hyperkinetic 
      and stereotyped movement disorders.
PG  - 841-8
LID - 10.1111/epi.12987 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Recently, de novo mutations in GRIN1 have been identified in patients 
      with nonsyndromic intellectual disability and epileptic encephalopathy. Whole exome 
      sequencing (WES) analysis of patients with genetically unsolved epileptic 
      encephalopathies identified four patients with GRIN1 mutations, allowing us to 
      investigate the phenotypic spectrum of GRIN1 mutations. METHODS: Eighty-eight 
      patients with unclassified early onset epileptic encephalopathies (EOEEs) with an 
      age of onset <1 year were analyzed by WES. The effect of mutations on 
      N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors was examined by mapping altered amino acids 
      onto three-dimensional models. RESULTS: We identified four de novo missense GRIN1 
      mutations in 4 of 88 patients with unclassified EOEEs. In these four patients, 
      initial symptoms appeared within 3 months of birth, including hyperkinetic movements 
      in two patients (2/4, 50%), and seizures in two patients (2/4, 50%). Involuntary 
      movements, severe developmental delay, and intellectual disability were recognized 
      in all four patients. In addition, abnormal eye movements resembling oculogyric 
      crises and stereotypic hand movements were observed in two and three patients, 
      respectively. All the four patients exhibited only nonspecific focal and diffuse 
      epileptiform abnormality, and never showed suppression-burst or hypsarrhythmia 
      during infancy. A de novo mosaic mutation (c.1923G>A) with a mutant allele frequency 
      of 16% (in DNA of blood leukocytes) was detected in one patient. Three mutations 
      were located in the transmembrane domain (3/4, 75%), and one in the extracellular 
      loop near transmembrane helix 1. All the mutations were predicted to impair the 
      function of the NMDA receptor. SIGNIFICANCE: Clinical features of de novo GRIN1 
      mutations include infantile involuntary movements, seizures, and hand stereotypies, 
      suggesting that GRIN1 mutations cause encephalopathy resulting in seizures and 
      movement disorders.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cerebellar atrophy and developmental delay are commonly associated 
      features in large numbers of genetic diseases that frequently also include epilepsy. 
      These defects are highly heterogeneous on both the genetic and clinical levels. 
      Patients with these signs also typically present with non-specific neuroimaging 
      results that can help prioritize further investigation but don't suggest a specific 
      molecular diagnosis. METHODS: To genetically explore a cohort of 18 Egyptian 
      families with undiagnosed cerebellar atrophy identified on MRI, we sequenced 
      probands and some non-affected family members via high-coverage whole exome 
      sequencing (WES; >97 % of the exome covered at least by 30x). Patients were mostly 
      from consanguineous families, either sporadic or multiplex. We analyzed WES data and 
      filtered variants according to dominant and recessive inheritance models. RESULTS: 
      We successfully identified disease-causing mutations in half of the families 
      screened (9/18). These mutations are located in seven different genes, PLA2G6 being 
      the gene most frequently mutated (n = 3). We also identified a recurrent de novo 
      mutation in the KIF1A gene and a molybdenum cofactor deficiency caused by the loss 
      of the start codon in the MOCS2A open-reading frame in a mildly affected subject. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This study illustrates the necessity of screening for dominant 
      mutations in WES data from consanguineous families. Our identification of a patient 
      with a mild and improving phenotype carrying a previously characterized severe loss 
      of function mutation also broadens the clinical spectrum associated with molybdenum 
      cofactor deficiency.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Glucose transporter type 1 deficiency syndrome is caused by 
      heterozygous, mostly de novo, mutations in the SLC2A1 gene encoding the glucose 
      transporter GLUT1. Mutations in this gene limit brain glucose availability and lead 
      to cerebral energy deficiency. STATE OF THE ART: The phenotype is characterized by 
      the variable association of mental retardation, acquired microcephaly, complex motor 
      disorders, and paroxysmal manifestations including seizures and non-epileptic 
      paroxysmal episodes. Clinical severity varies from mild motor dysfunction to severe 
      neurological disability. In patients with mild phenotypes, paroxysmal manifestations 
      may be the sole manifestations of the disease. In particular, the diagnosis should 
      be considered in patients with paroxysmal exercise-induced dyskinesia or with 
      early-onset generalized epilepsy. Low CSF level of glucose, relative to blood level, 
      is the best biochemical clue to the diagnosis although not constantly found. 
      Molecular analysis of the SLC2A1 gene confirms the diagnosis. Ketogenic diet is the 
      cornerstone of the treatment and implicates a close monitoring by a 
      multidisciplinary team including trained dieticians. Non-specific drugs may be used 
      as add-on symptomatic treatments but their effects are often disappointing. 
      CONCLUSION: Glucose transporter type 1 deficiency syndrome is likely under diagnosed 
      due to its complex and pleiotropic phenotype. Proper identification of the affected 
      patients is important for clinical practice since the disease is treatable.

TI  - Clinical classification of neuronal ceroid-lipofuscinosis subtypes.
PG  - 47-58
AB  - Neuronal ceroid-lipofuscinosis is the most common class of neurodegenerative disease 
      in children. After decades of study, the biochemical basis for this group of 
      diseases continues to elude scientists. One obstacle has been the difficulty in 
      establishing specific criteria for diagnosis. This paper reviews case material from 
      65 patients referred to the Shriver Center for study from January, 1984 to December, 
      1986. The late-infantile type was the most commonly encountered (35%) with a mean 
      age-of-onset of 3.1 +/- 0.5 yr. The juvenile type was slightly less frequent (32%) 
      with a mean age-of-onset of 7.8 +/- 4 yr. The infantile type ranked third (23%); 
      age-of-onset 11 +/- 4 months) and the adult form of the disease was the least common 
      (10%; age-of-onset 25 +/- 4 yr). Consistent clinical findings were a progressive 
      decline in mental faculties and seizures, predominantly of the myoclonic type. 
      Neuroradiological changes of cerebral and cerebellar cortical atrophy were common 
      when studies were obtained more than a year after clinical onset. Ataxia was a 
      frequent manifestation in the late-infantile and juvenile types whereas dystonia was 
      unique to the latter. There was a diversity of ultrastructural findings in skin 
      biopsies between and within types. The absence of findings in a few familial cases 
      necessitated sampling a second tissue such as muscle, particularly when the history 
      was suggestive and urine dolichols were high. Elevated urine dolichol levels was a 
      nonspecific but helpful finding.

TI  - Demographic and epidemiological determinants of healthcare costs in Netherlands: 
      cost of illness study.
PG  - 111-5
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the demands on healthcare resources caused by different 
      types of illnesses and variation with age and sex. DESIGN: Information on healthcare 
      use was obtained from all 22 healthcare sectors in the Netherlands. Most important 
      sectors (hospitals, nursing homes, inpatient psychiatric care, institutions for 
      mentally disabled people) have national registries. Total expenditures for each 
      sector were subdivided into 21 age groups, sex, and 34 diagnostic groups. SETTING: 
      Netherlands, 1994. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Proportion of healthcare budget spent on 
      each category of disease and cost of health care per person at various ages. 
      RESULTS: After the first year of life, costs per person for children were lowest. 
      Costs rose slowly throughout adult life and increased exponentially from age 50 
      onwards till the oldest age group (> or = 95). The top five areas of healthcare 
      costs were mental retardation, musculoskeletal disease (predominantly joint disease 
      and dorsopathy), dementia, a heterogeneous group of other mental disorders, and ill 
      defined conditions. Stroke, all cancers combined, and coronary heart disease ranked 
      7, 8, and 10, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The main determinants of healthcare use in 
      the Netherlands are old age and disabling conditions, particularly mental 
      disability. A large share of the healthcare budget is spent on long term nursing 
      care, and this cost will inevitably increase further in an ageing population. 
      Non-specific cost containment measures may endanger the quality of care for old and 
      mentally disabled people.

AB  - The recently released preliminary proposal for the DSM-5 diagnostic system includes 
      modification of the mixed mania diagnosis symptom set. That definition includes the 
      long-overdue exclusion of nonspecific signs and symptoms, as well as the inclusion 
      of psychomotor retardation. Anxiety is specifically excluded from the definition. 
      The current report reviews studies to establish that psychomotor retardation would 
      have limited utility in the definition, in contrast to anxiety, which is a core 
      symptom of the mixed manic subtype.

TI  - Prevalence and risk of violence against adults with disabilities: a systematic 
      review and meta-analysis of observational studies.
PG  - 1621-9
LID - 10.1016/S0140-6736(11)61851-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: About 15% of adults worldwide have a disability. These individuals are 
      frequently reported to be at increased risk of violence, yet quantitative syntheses 
      of studies of this issue are scarce. We aimed to quantify violence against adults 
      with disabilities. METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched 
      12 electronic databases to identify primary research studies published between Jan 
      1, 1990, and Aug 17, 2010, reporting prevalence estimates of violence against adults 
      (aged mainly ≥18 years) with disabilities, or their risk of violence compared with 
      non-disabled adults. We included only studies reporting violence occurring within 
      the 12 months before the study. We assessed studies with six core quality criteria, 
      and pooled data for analysis. FINDINGS: Of 10,663 references initially identified, 
      26 were eligible for inclusion, with data for 21,557 individuals with disabilities. 
      21 studies provided data suitable for meta-analysis of prevalence of violence, and 
      ten for meta-analysis of risks of violence. Pooled prevalence of any (physical, 
      sexual, or intimate partner) recent violence was 24·3% (95% CI 18·3-31·0) in people 
      with mental illnesses, 6·1% (2·5-11·1) in those with intellectual impairments, and 
      3·2% (2·5-4·1) in those with non-specific impairments. We identified substantial 
      heterogeneity in most prevalence estimates (I(2) >75%). We noted large uncertainty 
      around pooled risk estimates. Pooled crude odds ratios for the risk of violence in 
      disabled compared with non-disabled individuals were 1·50 (95% CI 1·09-2·05) for all 
      studies combined, 1·31 (0·93-1·84) for people with non-specific impairments, 1·60 
      (1·05-2·45) for people with intellectual impairments, and 3·86 (0·91-16·43) for 
      those with mental illnesses. INTERPRETATION: Adults with disabilities are at a 
      higher risk of violence than are non-disabled adults, and those with mental 
      illnesses could be particularly vulnerable. However, available studies have 
      methodological weaknesses and gaps exist in the types of disability and violence 
      they address. Robust studies are absent for most regions of the world, particularly 
      low-income and middle-income countries. FUNDING: WHO Department of Violence and 
      Injury Prevention and Disability.

PG  - 771-781
LID - 10.1007/s10545-017-0093-8 [doi]
AB  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of bile 
      acid synthesis caused by mutations in the cytochrome P450 CYP27A1 gene that result 
      in production of a defective sterol 27-hydroxylase enzyme. CTX is associated with 
      abnormally high levels of cholestanol in the blood and accumulation of cholestanol 
      and cholesterol in the brain, tendon xanthomas, and bile. Hallmark clinical 
      manifestations of CTX include chronic diarrhea, bilateral cataracts, tendon 
      xanthomas, and neurologic dysfunction. Although CTX is a rare disorder, it is 
      thought to be underdiagnosed, as presenting signs and symptoms may be nonspecific 
      with significant overlap with other more common conditions. There is marked 
      variability in signs and symptoms, severity, and age of onset between patients. The 
      disease course is progressive and potentially debilitating or fatal, particularly 
      with respect to neurologic presentations that can include intellectual disability, 
      autism, behavioral and psychiatric problems, and dementia, among others. Treatment 
      with chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA; chenodiol) is the current standard of care. CDCA 
      can help restore normal sterol, bile acid, bile alcohol, and cholestanol levels. 
      CDCA also appears to be generally effective in preventing adverse clinical 
      manifestations of the disease from occurring or progressing if administered early 
      enough. Improved screening and awareness of the condition may help facilitate early 
      diagnosis and treatment.

      A systematic literature review.
LID - S1090-3798(21)00156-2 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.ejpn.2021.08.006 [doi]
AB  - Clinical manifestations of malformations of cortical development (MCD) are variable 
      and can range from mild to severe intellectual disability, cerebral palsy and 
      drug-resistant epilepsy. Besides common clinical features, non-specific or more 
      subtle clinical symptoms may be present in association with different types of MCD. 
      Especially in severely affected individuals, subtle but specific underlying clinical 
      symptoms can be overlooked or overshadowed by the global clinical presentation. To 
      facilitate the interpretation of genetic variants detailed clinical information is 
      indispensable. Detailed (neurological) examination can be helpful in assisting with 
      the diagnostic trajectory, both when referring for genetic work-up as well as when 
      interpreting data from molecular genetic testing. This systematic literature review 
      focusses on different clues derived from the neurological examination and potential 
      further work-up triggered by these signs and symptoms in genetically defined MCDs. A 
      concise overview of specific neurological findings and their associations with MCD 
      subtype and genotype are presented, easily applicable in daily clinical practice. 
      The following pathologies will be discussed: neuropathy, myopathy, muscular 
      dystrophies and spastic paraplegia. In the discussion section, tips and pitfalls are 
      illustrated to improve clinical outcome in the future.

TI  - Genetics of bipolar disorder.
PG  - 33-42
LID - 10.2147/TACG.S39297 [doi]
AB  - Bipolar disorder is a common, complex genetic disorder, but the mode of transmission 
      remains to be discovered. Many researchers assume that common genomic variants carry 
      some risk for manifesting the disease. The research community has celebrated the 
      first genome-wide significant associations between common single nucleotide 
      polymorphisms (SNPs) and bipolar disorder. Currently, attempts are under way to 
      translate these findings into clinical practice, genetic counseling, and predictive 
      testing. However, some experts remain cautious. After all, common variants explain 
      only a very small percentage of the genetic risk, and functional consequences of the 
      discovered SNPs are inconclusive. Furthermore, the associated SNPs are not disease 
      specific, and the majority of individuals with a "risk" allele are healthy. On the 
      other hand, population-based genome-wide studies in psychiatric disorders have 
      rediscovered rare structural variants and mutations in genes, which were previously 
      known to cause genetic syndromes and monogenic Mendelian disorders. In many 
      Mendelian syndromes, psychiatric symptoms are prevalent. Although these conditions 
      do not fit the classic description of any specific psychiatric disorder, they often 
      show nonspecific psychiatric symptoms that cross diagnostic boundaries, including 
      intellectual disability, behavioral abnormalities, mood disorders, anxiety 
      disorders, attention deficit, impulse control deficit, and psychosis. Although 
      testing for chromosomal disorders and monogenic Mendelian disorders is well 
      established, testing for common variants is still controversial. The standard 
      concept of genetic testing includes at least three broad criteria that need to be 
      fulfilled before new genetic tests should be introduced: analytical validity, 
      clinical validity, and clinical utility. These criteria are currently not fulfilled 
      for common genomic variants in psychiatric disorders. Further work is clearly needed 
      before genetic testing for common variants in psychiatric disorders should be 
      established.

      questions.
PG  - 497-512
LID - 10.1007/s00430-012-0257-y [doi]
AB  - Medical interest in cytomegalovirus (CMV) is based on lifelong neurological 
      sequelae, such as sensorineural hearing loss and mental retardation, resulting from 
      congenital infection of the fetus in utero, as well as on CMV disease with multiple 
      organ manifestations and graft loss in recipients of hematopoietic cell 
      transplantation or solid organ transplantation. CMV infection of transplantation 
      recipients occurs consequent to reactivation of virus harbored in a latent state in 
      the transplanted donor cells and tissues, or in the tissues of the transplantation 
      recipient herself or himself. Hence, CMV infection is a paradigm for a viral 
      infection that causes disease primarily in the immunocompromised host, while 
      infection of the immunocompetent host is associated with only mild and nonspecific 
      symptoms so that it usually goes unnoticed. Thus, CMV is kept under strict immune 
      surveillance. These medical facts are in apparent conflict with the notion that CMVs 
      in general, human CMV as well as animal CMVs, are masters of 'immune evasion', which 
      during virus-host co-speciation have convergently evolved sophisticated mechanisms 
      to avoid their recognition by innate and adaptive immunity of their respective host 
      species, with viral genes apparently dedicated to serve just this purpose (Reddehase 
      in Nat Rev Immunol 2:831-844, 2002). With focus on viral interference with antigen 
      presentation to CD8 T cells in the preclinical model of murine CMV infection, we try 
      here to shed some more light on the in vivo balance between host immune surveillance 
      of CMV infection and viral 'immune evasion' strategies.

TI  - Pathogenic mechanisms in lysosomal disease: a reappraisal of the role of the 
      lysosome.
PG  - 26-32
AB  - The view that lysosomes simply represent end organelles in the serial degradation of 
      polymeric molecules derived from the cell surface and its interior has led to major 
      misconceptions about the nature of lysosomal storage diseases and the pathogenic 
      cascades that characterize them. Accordingly, lysosomal storage bodies are often 
      considered 'inert', inducing cell dysfunction and death primarily through mechanical 
      overcrowding of normal organelles or by other non-specific means leading to 
      generalized cytotoxicity. However, modern studies of lysosomes and their component 
      proteins provide evidence to support a far greater role for these organelles in cell 
      metabolism. In intimate association with endosomal, autophagosomal and related 
      vesicular systems, the greater lysosomal system can be conceptualized as a vital 
      recycling centre that serves as a central metabolic coordinator, influencing 
      literally every aspect of the cell, from signal transduction to regulation of gene 
      expression. CONCLUSION: This broader view of the role of lysosomes in cells not only 
      provides insight into how single gene defects impacting on lysosomal function can 
      result in the plethora of complex cellular transformations characteristic of these 
      diseases, but also suggests new and innovative therapies that may hold considerable 
      promise for ameliorating disease progression.

TI  - A girl with cutaneous hyperpigmentation, café au lait spots and ring chromosome 15 
      without significant deletion.
PG  - 337-42
AB  - Ring chromosome 15 [r(15)] syndrome is characterised by specific facial features, 
      café au lait spots, failure to thrive, mental retardation and typically with a 
      terminal deletion of the long arm of chromosome 15. We report a 2.5 year old girl 
      showing normal growth and development, large hyperpigmented skin changes showing 
      hypopigmentated areas inside, multiple café au lait spots and premature graying-like 
      hypopigmentation of scalp hair. She had a karyotype of r(15) in peripheral 
      lymphocytes and fibroblasts. By FISH analysis the breakpoint was located distal to 
      locus D15S936 (15q26.3) and within 300 kb of the end of the chromosome, indicating 
      no deletion of functional genes on 15q. Hyperpigmentation and café au lait spots are 
      rare signs in ring chromosome syndromes, but with r(15) syndrome, café au lait spots 
      have been described in about 30% of patients and have been considered to result from 
      the deletion of gene(s) on distal 15q. Based on the frequent observation of patchy 
      hyperpigmentation with the r(15) syndrome, absent hyperpigmentation in cases of 
      distal 15q deletion without a ring chromosome, and the telomeric breakpoint location 
      in our patient indicating no significant deletion, we propose that the cutaneous 
      hyperpigmentation and café au lait spots in our proband represent effects of the 
      r(15) chromosome but are not caused by the deletion of specific gene(s) on distal 
      15q. Patchy skin hypopigmentation is a well known nonspecific sign in cytogenetic 
      mosaicism which is commonly seen in ring syndrome.

PG  - 175-80
AB  - To test the hypothesis that T lymphocytes sensitized to central nervous system (CNS) 
      antigens may quantitatively induce more demyelination in neural tissue than T cells 
      sensitized to non-CNS antigens, we established T cell lines specific for myelin 
      basic protein (MBP) or the purified protein derivative (PPD) of M. tuberculosis. The 
      potential of T cells to cause myelin pathology was determined by measuring the 
      activity of the myelin-associated enzyme 2'-3'-cyclic nucleotide 
      3'-phosphodiesterase (CNPase) in organotypic cultures of syngeneic spinal cord after 
      incubation with the T cell lines. The activity of CNPase in neural tissue has been 
      shown to correlate positively with the amount and integrity of CNS myelin. Although 
      both MBP- and PPD-specific T cells caused decreases in CNPase activity, the MBP line 
      caused significantly greater and consistent changes. This finding indicates that T 
      cell-mediated CNS demyelination may be comprised of CNS antigen-specific and CNS 
      non-specific components, the former causing more pathology.

TI  - Ultrastructural study of transcellular transport of native and cationized albumin in 
      cultured goat brain microvascular endothelium [corrected].
PG  - 998-1006
AB  - The interaction of native and cationized bovine serum albumin-gold complex with 
      confluent monolayers of goat [corrected] brain microvascular endothelial cells was 
      investigated. These cells were used as an in vitro model of the blood-brain barrier. 
      After exposure to both complexes for 5, 15, 30, and 60 min, the endothelial cells 
      were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed, and processed for electron 
      microscopy. The results obtained suggest that (a) contrary to previous observations 
      in vivo, cultured endothelial cells were able to transfer native bovine serum 
      albumin-gold complex particles from apical to basolateral surfaces presumably via a 
      fluid-phase mechanism; (b) the most conspicuous difference in the interaction of 
      both albumin-gold complexes consisted in a significantly greater adsorption of 
      cationized than of native bovine serum albumin-gold complex to the apical surface of 
      the endothelial cells; (c) the further fate of the endocytosed complexes was 
      similar, that is, their major part was internalized into endosomes, multivesicular 
      bodies and lysosomes whereas a smaller fraction was apparently transferred to the 
      basolateral plasma membrane where presumably they were exocytosed into the 
      subendothelial space. These observations provide new ultrastructural evidence that 
      both native and cationized albumin are endocytosed and eventually transported by a 
      non-specific, fluid-phase mechanism, and also support the results of earlier 
      quantitative studies indicating the absence of albumin receptors in brain 
      endothelia.

TI  - Congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus with a novel mutation in the aquaporin 2 
      gene.
PG  - 596-598
AB  - Congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (CNDI) is a rare disorder caused by 
      mutations of the arginine vasopressin (AVP) V2 receptor or aquaporin 2 (AQP2) genes. 
      The current study presented the case of CNDI in a 1-month-old male with a novel 
      mutation in the AQP2 gene. The patient was referred due to the occurrence of 
      hypernatremia and mild-intermittent fever since birth. An AVP stimulation test was 
      compatible with CNDI as there was no significant response to desmopressin. Molecular 
      genetic analysis demonstrated two mutations in exon 1 of the AQP2 gene: C to T 
      transition, which resulted in a missense mutation of (108)Thr (ACG) to Met (ATG); 
      and a 127, 128 delCA, which resulted in a deletion mutation of glutamine in position 
      43 at codon CAG as the first affected amino acid, with the new reading frame endign 
      in a termination codon at position 62. The molecular genetic analysis of the parents 
      showed that the missense mutation was inherited maternally and the deletion mutation 
      was inherited paternally. The parents showed no signs or symptoms of CNDI, 
      indicating autosomal recessive inheritance. The (108)Thr (ACG) to Met (ATG) mutation 
      was confirmed as a novel mutation. Therefore, the molecular identification of the 
      AQP2 gene has clinical significance, as early recognition of CNDI in infants that 
      show only non-specific symptoms, can be facilitated. Thus, repeated episodes of 
      dehydration, which may cause physical and mental retardation can be avoided.

TI  - Multiple independent spike foci and epilepsy, with special reference to a new 
      epileptic syndrome of "severe epilepsy with multiple independent spike foci".
PG  - S96-104
AB  - BACKGROUND: Markand and Blume first realized the specificity of the EEG pattern of 
      multiple independent spike foci (MISF) in the late 1970s; its close relation with 
      hypsarrhythmia and slow spike-waves, extensive bilateral brain lesion, and 
      intractable seizures. But they did not recognize it as an epileptic syndrome. On the 
      other hand, the authors had been taken notice of severe epilepsy with MISF (SE-MISF) 
      as a peculiar clinico-electrical entity showing "generalized seizures", and pointed 
      out its close relation to Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) from the long-term follow-up 
      of LGS. SUMMARY POINTS: SE-MISF is characterized by (1) interictal EEG showing 
      multiple independent spike foci (three or more foci in both hemisphere, i.e. at 
      least one in each hemisphere) and diffuse slowing of the background activity. 
      Diffuse epileptic discharges are rare. (2) The main seizure type is frequent 
      generalized minor seizures, often tonic spasms. (3) Mutual transition is often 
      observed between the age-dependent epileptic encephalopathies, i.e. Ohtahara 
      syndrome, West syndrome and LGS. (4) The age at epilepsy onset is early, but the 
      onset of SE-MISF is variable. (5) It is often associated with mental retardation and 
      neurological abnormalities, usually severe. (6) Etiology is variable and largely 
      nonspecific, including prenatal, perinatal, and postnatal cerebral pathologies. (7) 
      Prognoses for seizures and psychomotor development are poor. Seizures are very 
      intractable and may cause psychomotor deterioration. CONCLUSION: SE-MISF may be 
      classified into symptomatic generalized epilepsy, namely a diffuse encephalopathy 
      with mutual transition between other age-dependent epileptic encephalopathies. This 
      characteristic entity may be acknowledged as a new epileptic syndrome.

TI  - Prevention of intellectual and other disabilities: the Singapore experience.
PG  - 278-84
AB  - In Singapore, first level prevention, aimed at reducing the occurrence of 
      disabilities, has included neonatal screening for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase 
      deficiency, a programme of universal vaccination, screening for congenital 
      hypothyroidism, and improvements in obstetric and neonatal care. Non-specific 
      measures, such as improved housing, better nutrition and higher standards of 
      education, have also contributed to the reduction in serious illnesses that can 
      potentially cause disabilities. Second level prevention, designed to limit or 
      reverse a disability, has included a developmental screening programme carried out 
      in the primary health care sector. Centralised multi-disciplinary developmental 
      assessment clinics have been established to define better the disabilities and to 
      advise on rehabilitation. An early intervention programme has been started, and 
      special schools are being upgraded. Third level prevention, aimed at preventing a 
      disability from becoming a handicap, has included the setting up of comprehensive 
      rehabilitation programmes, provision of aids and appliances, vocational training, 
      and job opportunities. The integration of the handicapped back into society is 
      currently being promoted.

AB  - Cerebral palsy (CP) is a non-progressive neurodevelopmental disorder characterized 
      by motor impairments, often accompanied by co-morbidities such as intellectual 
      disability, epilepsy, visual and hearing impairment and speech and language 
      deficits. Despite the established role of hypoxic-ischemic injury in some CP cases, 
      several studies suggest that birth asphyxia is actually an uncommon cause, 
      accounting for <10% of CP cases. For children with CP in the absence of traditional 
      risk factors, a genetic basis to their condition is increasingly suspected. Several 
      recent studies indeed confirm copy number variants and single gene mutations with 
      large genetic heterogeneity as an etiology in children with CP. Here, we report 
      three patients with spastic cerebral palsy and a genetically confirmed diagnosis of 
      Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS), with highly variable phenotypes ranging from 
      clinically suggestive to non-specific symptomatology. Our findings suggest that AGS 
      may be a rather common cause of CP, that frequently remains undiagnosed without 
      additional genetic testing, as in only one case a clinical suspicion of AGS was 
      raised. Our data show that a diagnosis of AGS must be considered in cases with 
      spastic CP, even in the absence of characteristic brain abnormalities. Importantly, 
      a genetic diagnosis of AGS may have significant therapeutic consequences, as 
      targeted therapies are being developed for type 1 interferonopathies, the group of 
      diseases to which AGS belongs. Our findings demonstrate the importance of next 
      generation sequencing in CP patients without an identifiable cause, since targeted 
      diagnostic testing is hampered by the often non-specific presentation.

TI  - Spatial learning deficits induced by muscimol and CL218,872: lack of effect of 
      prenatal malnutrition.
PG  - 379-87
AB  - The sensitivity of prenatal protein malnourished rats to the amnestic properties of 
      the direct GABAA receptor agonist muscimol and the selective benzodiazepine (BZ) 
      receptor agonist, CL218,872, was studied in the male offspring of rats provided with 
      a protein deficient diet (6% casein) for 5 weeks prior to mating and throughout 
      pregnancy. At postnatal day 90, rats were tested during acquisition of the submerged 
      platform version of the Morris water maze task using four systemic doses of muscimol 
      (0.1, 0.3, 1.0 and 1.8 mg/kg i.p.) or three systemic doses of CL218,872 (1.0, 3.2, 
      and 5.6 mg/kg i.p.). In a dose dependent manner both drugs impaired acquisition of 
      the task and impaired accuracy of the search pattern on the probe trial (platform 
      removed). However, neither drug dissociated the performance of the two nutritional 
      groups. These data are important in light of previous findings of differential 
      behavioral effects of the non-specific BZ agonist, chlordiazepoxide (CDP), on 
      spatial learning and on drug discrimination in prenatally malnourished rats and in 
      the context of previous findings of reduced sensitivity to the anxiolytic effects of 
      non-specific BZ receptor agonists across a wide variety of models of malnutrition. 
      The present findings also support the concept that prenatal malnutrition does not 
      affect the global functioning of the GABAA receptor, but fundamentally alters the 
      way in which a subset of GABAA receptors (i.e. those containing the alpha2, alpha3 
      and/or the alpha5 but not the alpha1 subunit) is modulated by BZs.

AB  - Decoding abilities in individuals with intellectual disabilities (ID) are 
      substantially lower than for typical readers. The underlying mechanisms of their 
      poor reading remain uncertain. The aim of this study was to investigate the 
      concurrent predictors of decoding ability in 136 adolescents with non-specific ID, 
      and to evaluate the results in relation to previous findings on typical readers. The 
      study included a broad range of cognitive and language measures as predictors of 
      decoding ability. A LASSO regression analysis identified phonological awareness and 
      rapid automatized naming (RAN) as the most important predictors. The predictors 
      explained 57.73% of the variance in decoding abilities. These variables are similar 
      to the ones found in earlier research on typically developing children, hence 
      supporting our hypothesis of a delayed rather than a different reading profile. 
      These results lend some support to the use of interventions and reading 
      instructions, originally developed for typically developing children, for children 
      and adolescents with non-specific ID.

TI  - Clinical Characteristics and Genotype-Phenotype Correlation in Children with KMT2E 
      Gene-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorders: Report of Two New Cases and Review of 
      Published Literature.
PG  - 98-104
LID - 10.1055/s-0040-1715629 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In recent years, many new candidate genes are being identified as 
      putative pathogenic factors in children with developmental delay and autism. 
      Recently, heterozygous mutations in the KMT2E gene have been identified as a cause 
      of a unique neurodevelopmental disorder with variable combination of global 
      developmental delay or isolated speech delay, intellectual disability, autistic 
      features, and seizures. METHODS: Here, we present two new cases of KMT2E 
      mutation-associated neurodevelopmental disorder in a 4-year-old girl and 5-year-old 
      boy. We also performed a pooled review of the previously published cases of 
      KMT2E-related neurodevelopmental disorder. Articles were identified through search 
      engines using appropriate search terms. RESULTS: Along with the presented 2 cases, 
      40 cases were analyzed. Out of them, 30, 6, and 4 children had protein-truncating 
      mutations, missense mutations, and copy number variants, respectively. The common 
      features were global developmental delay (97%) followed by macrocephaly (35%), 
      seizures (30%), and autism (25%). Children with missense variants had severe 
      phenotype, with microcephaly, profound developmental delay, and increased frequency 
      of seizures. Neuroimaging revealed nonspecific changes, including cerebral white 
      matter signal abnormalities. CONCLUSION: KMT2E-related neurodevelopmental disorder 
      remains one of the clinical differentials in children with global developmental 
      delay and/or autistic features/seizure. With the reporting of more cases in the 
      future, the already heterogeneous clinical spectrum of this disease is likely to be 
      widened.

TI  - An atypical case of Noonan syndrome with KRAS mutation diagnosed by targeted exome 
      sequencing.
PG  - 203-207
LID - 10.6065/apem.2017.22.3.203 [doi]
AB  - Noonan syndrome (NS) is a genetic disorder caused by autosomal dominant inheritance 
      and is characterized by a distinctive facial appearance, short stature, chest 
      deformity, and congenital heart disease. In individuals with NS, germline mutations 
      have been identified in several genes involved in the RAS/mitogen-activated protein 
      kinase signal transduction pathway. Because of its clinical and genetic 
      heterogeneity, the conventional diagnostic protocol with Sanger sequencing requires 
      a multistep approach. Therefore, molecular genetic diagnosis using targeted exome 
      sequencing (TES) is considered a less expensive and faster method, particularly for 
      patients who do not fulfill the clinical diagnostic criteria of NS. In this case, 
      the patient showed short stature, dysmorphic facial features suggestive of NS, 
      feeding intolerance, cryptorchidism, and intellectual disability in early childhood. 
      At the age of 16, the patient still showed extreme short stature with delayed 
      puberty and characteristic facial features suggestive of NS. Although the patient 
      had no cardiac problems or chest wall deformities, which are commonly present in NS 
      and are major concerns for patients and clinicians, the patient showed several other 
      characteristic clinical features of NS. Considering the possibility of a genetic 
      disorder, including NS, a molecular genetic study with TES was performed. With TES 
      analysis, we detected a pathogenic variant of c.458A > T in KRAS in this patient 
      with atypical NS phenotype and provided appropriate clinical management and genetic 
      counseling. The application of TES enables accurate molecular diagnosis of patients 
      with nonspecific or atypical features in genetic diseases with several responsible 
      genes, such as NS.

TI  - Diagnostic utility of whole exome sequencing in patients showing cerebellar and/or

AB  - Cerebellar and/or vermis atrophy is recognized in various types of childhood 
      disorders with clinical and genetic heterogeneity. Although careful evaluation of 
      clinical features and neuroimaging can lead to correct diagnosis of disorders, their 
      diagnosis is sometimes difficult because clinical features can overlap with each 
      other. In this study, we performed family-based whole exome sequencing of 23 
      families including 25 patients with cerebellar and/or vermis atrophy in childhood, 
      who were unable to be diagnosed solely by clinical examination. Pathological 
      mutations of seven genes were found in ten patients from nine families (9/23, 
      39.1 %): compound heterozygous mutations in FOLR1, C5orf42, POLG, TPP1, PEX16, and 
      de novo mutations in CACNA1A, and ITPR1. Patient 1A with FOLR1 mutations showed 
      extremely low concentration of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate in the cerebrospinal fluid 
      and serum, and Patient 6 with TPP1 mutations demonstrated markedly lowered 
      tripeptidyl peptidase 1 activity in leukocytes. Furthermore, Patient 8 with PEX16 
      mutations presented a mild increase of very long chain fatty acids in the serum as 
      supportive data for genetic diagnosis. The main clinical features of these ten 
      patients were nonspecific and mixed, and included developmental delay, intellectual 
      disability, ataxia, hypotonia, and epilepsy. Brain MRI revealed both cerebellar and 
      vermis atrophy in eight patients (8/10, 80 %), vermis atrophy/hypoplasia in two 
      patients (2/10, 20 %), and brainstem atrophy in one patient (1/10, 10 %). Our data 
      clearly demonstrate the utility of whole exome sequencing for genetic diagnosis of 
      childhood cerebellar and/or vermis atrophy.

TI  - Febrile Infection-Related Epilepsy Syndrome (FIRES): A Literature Review and Case 
      Study.
PG  - 224-233
LID - 10.1080/21646821.2017.1355181 [doi]
AB  - Febrile infection-related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES) is a catastrophic epileptic 
      syndrome that strikes previously healthy children aged 3-15 years and has an unknown 
      pathogenesis and few treatments. These children experience a nonspecific febrile 
      illness that is followed by prolonged refractory status epilepticus. Although the 
      etiology is unknown, FIRES has a biphasic presentation, with the acute phase 
      beginning as seizure activity lasting 1-12 weeks, then followed by the chronic 
      phase, which is characterized by refractory seizures that cluster every 2-4 weeks, 
      and may continue to be multifocal and independent. Treatment of FIRES is difficult, 
      typically unresponsive to antiepileptic drugs. Some children resolve temporarily 
      with drug-induced burst suppression comas. Other therapies such as a ketogenic diet 
      have limited benefit. The outcome varies with the length of the acute phase and is 
      usually poor, with up to 30% of cases ending in death and 66-100% of survivors 
      having intellectual disability. The authors present a case of a 6-year-old child 
      presenting with FIRES and refractory status epilepticus, which continued despite 
      multidrug therapy. The patient underwent immunomodulatory therapy with the eventual 
      resolution of status, but she developed a chronic, moderately severe encephalopathy, 
      including intractable epilepsy. This case highlights the challenges of FIRES and the 
      potential of immunomodulatory therapies for children with this disorder.

AB  - AIMS: To investigate hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) in a pediatric Brazilian 
      sample. METHODS: Epidemiological, clinical, radiological and laboratory data were 
      analyzed in 35 patients. RESULTS: Simple HSP (HSP-S) was detected in 12 patients, 
      and complicated HSP (HSP-C) was detected in 23 patients. The mean age of onset of 
      symptoms was 2.9 years in HSP-S and 1.6 years in HSP-C (p = 0.023). The disease was 
      more severe in HSP-C. There were no differences in sex, ethnic background, or family 
      history between groups. Intellectual disability was the most frequent finding 
      associated with HSP-C. Peripheral axonal neuropathy was found in three patients. In 
      the HSP-C group, MRI was abnormal in 13 patients. The MRI abnormalities included 
      nonspecific white matter lesions, cerebellar atrophy, thinning of the corpus 
      callosum and the "ear of the lynx sign". CONCLUSIONS: In children with spastic 
      paraplegia, HSP must be considered whenever similar pathologies, mainly diplegic 
      cerebral palsy, are ruled out.

TI  - Subtelomere deletions and translocations are frequently familial.
PG  - 28-35
AB  - In recent years, strategies have been developed to investigate the possible role of 
      chromosomal subtelomere regions in genetic disorders. The present study was to 
      determine the incidence of familial subtelomeric abnormalities among individuals 
      with developmental delay, idiopathic mental retardation, or non-specific congenital 
      abnormalities. A review was conducted for patients and their relatives on whom 
      subtelomeric DNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (telo-FISH) studies were 
      performed. Patients were identified through a search of the Mayo Genetics System 
      (MGS) database. Of 2,170 consecutive telo-FISH index case studies completed in our 
      laboratory between January 2002 and December 2003, 121 or 5.6% had abnormalities of 
      the subtelomere region. The present report includes 18 other abnormal index cases 
      seen prior to 2002 to yield a total of 139 abnormal index cases. This represents 71 
      index patients with deletions, 53 index patients with derivative chromosomes, and 15 
      index patients with balanced rearrangements. A familial abnormality was identified 
      in 29 (51.8%) of 56 families in whom parents and/or sibs were available for testing. 
      Among 28 patients with deletions, 9 (32%) had an inherited deletion, whereas 19 
      (68%) were de novo. Family members of 20 index patients with derivative chromosomes 
      were tested. Of these, 13 (65%) patients inherited the abnormality from a parent (12 
      from a parent who had a balanced translocation and 1 from a parent with the same 
      abnormality), while 7 (35%) apparently arose de novo. Seven (88%) of 8 with balanced 
      translocations inherited the translocation from one parent. The most common familial 
      abnormalities involved 8pter deletion or rearrangement. The incidence of familial 
      subtelomeric abnormalities is significantly high making parental telo-FISH studies 
      an essential part of the investigation of patients with subtelomeric chromosome 
      abnormalities.

TI  - Clinical characteristics and responsiveness to treatment in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. 
      A retrospective hospital audit.
PG  - 24-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical profile of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) 
      patients and to assess the best antiepileptic drug combination. METHODS: Patient 
      files of all children diagnosed with LGS at King Abdul-Aziz University (KAUH), 
      Jeddah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia between January 2000 to January 2005 were retrieved 
      and analyzed. Details on clinical data, and disease related variables were 
      collected. Treatment trial, last drug combination, maintenance dosage, seizure 
      frequency, and duration before and after treatment, and the overall effect in 
      reducing seizures were recorded. RESULTS: Fifty-four patients were identified with a 
      male:female ratio of 2.4:1 with age range of 10 months to 14 years. A history of 
      febrile convulsion was found in 11 (20%) patients, history of infantile spasm was 
      found in 14 patients (26%), mental retardation in 52 patients (96%), and hypotonia 
      in 13 patients (24%). All patients had abnormal EEG that meets the diagnostic 
      criteria. Brain CT scan was abnormal in 32 (65%) patients. Brain MRI was abnormal in 
      17 (23%) patients. Neuroradiological abnormalities varied from non-specific atrophy 
      to hippocampal sclerosis and calcification. Metabolic screening carried out for 11 
      patients (20%) was normal. All patients were on a 3-drug combination at some stage 
      of their disease. The most frequent combination was sodium valproate and 
      lamotrigine. Intravenous immunoglobulin was used in 2 patients with temporary 
      improvement; ketogenic diet was tried in one patient, which did not add much to fit 
      control. CONCLUSION: The severe nature and intractability of LGS emphasize the need 
      for active and efficacious treatment, which can improve the prognosis as a whole. 
      Different combinations of new anticonvulsants could achieve significant seizure 
      control and could modify the quality of life for these patients. Each patient needs 
      to be considered individually, taking into account the potential benefit of each 
      therapy weighed against the risk of adverse effects.

TI  - Effect of maternal tobacco smoke exposure on the placental transcriptome.
PG  - 186-91
LID - 10.1016/j.placenta.2009.12.016 [doi]
AB  - Smoking in pregnancy increases a woman's risk of preterm delivery resulting in 
      serious neonatal health problems and chronic lifelong disabilities for the children 
      (e.g., mental retardation, learning problems). To study the effects of tobacco smoke 
      on the placental transcriptome, we performed gene expression profiling on placentas 
      from women exposed to tobacco smoke in pregnancy (N = 12) and from those without 
      significant exposure (N = 64). Gene expression profiles were determined by Illumina 
      HumanRef-8 v2 Expression BeadChips with 18,216 gene probes. Microarray data were 
      normalized by quantile method and filtered for a detection P-value <0.01. 
      Differential gene expression was determined by moderated t-statistic. A linear model 
      was fitted for each gene given a series of arrays using lmFit function. Multiple 
      testing correction was performed using the Benjamini and Hochberg method. Abundant 
      levels of transcripts were found for genes encoding placental hormones (CSH1, 
      CSHL1), pregnancy-specific proteins (PSG3, PSG4, PAPPA), and hemoglobins (HBB, HBG, 
      HBA). Comparative analysis of smokers vs nonsmokers revealed the differential 
      expression of 241 genes (P < 0.05). In smoker cohort, we detected high up-regulation 
      of xenobiotic genes (CYP1A1, CYP1B1, CYB5A, COX412), collagen genes (e.g., COL6A3, 
      COL1A1, COL1A2), coagulation genes (F5, F13A1) as well as thrombosis-related genes 
      (CD36, ADAMTS9, GAS6). In smokers, we identified deregulated genes that show tissue 
      non-specific induction and may be considered as general biomarkers of tobacco smoke 
      exposure. Further, we also found genes specifically deregulated in the exposed 
      placentas. Functional annotation analysis suggested processes and pathways affected 
      by tobacco smoke exposure that may represent molecular mechanisms of smoke-induced 
      placental abnormalities.

TI  - MRI features in 17 patients with l2 hydroxyglutaric aciduria.
PG  - 245-250
AB  - l-2-Hydroxyglutaric (l-2-HG) aciduria is a rare inherited metabolic disease usually 
      observed in children. Patients present a very slowly progressive deterioration with 
      cerebellar ataxia, mild or severe mental retardation, and various other clinical 
      signs including extrapyramidal and pyramidal symptoms, and seizures Goffette et al. 
      [1]. This leukencephalopathy was first described in 1980 Duran et al. [2]. Brain 
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrates nonspecific subcortical white matter 
      (WM) loss, cerebellar atrophy and changes in dentate nuclei and putamen Steenweg et 
      al. [3]. The diagnosis is highlighted by increased levels of l-2-HG in body fluids 
      such as urine and cerebrospinal fluid. The purpose of this study is to 
      retrospectively describe the brain MRI features in l-2-HG aciduria.

      GABA degradation pathway, the substrate, succinic semialdehyde, is shunted towards 
      production of 4-hydroxybutyric acid (gamma-hydroxybutyric acid). Elevations of 
      gamma-hydroxybutyric acid can be detected in the physiologic fluids of patients with 
      SSADH deficiency, and forms the mainstay of diagnosis. The clinical features of 
      SSADH deficiency include nonspecific neurologic manifestations such as mental 
      retardation/developmental delay, absent speech, hypotonia, nonprogressive ataxia, 
      features of autism or pervasive developmental delay, developmental language delay 
      (dyspraxia, receptive, and expressive delays), and occasionally, seizures. Although 
      the metabolic pathway has been established, it is not known whether insufficient 
      GABA and/or excess gamma-hydroxybutyric acid contribute to the disease phenotype. 
      Pharmacological therapy in patients with this disorder has been limited to 
      vigabatrin, an anticonvulsant that blocks GABA transaminase. This review will 
      discuss therapeutic options in SSADH deficiency, on the basis of patient experience, 
      and preliminary work using a murine model. Finally, a discussion of adjunctive 
      therapies will be included.

TI  - Developmental Outcomes of Aicardi Goutières Syndrome.
PG  - 7-16
LID - 10.1177/0883073819870944 [doi]
AB  - Aicardi Goutières syndrome is a monogenic interferonopathy caused by abnormalities 
      in the intracellular nucleic acid sensing machinery (TREX1, RNASEH2A, RNASEH2B, 
      RNASEH2C, SAMHD1, ADAR1, or IFIH1). Most individuals affected by Aicardi Goutières 
      syndrome exhibit some degree of neurologic impairment, from spastic paraparesis with 
      relatively preserved cognition to tetraparesis and severe intellectual disability. 
      Because of this heterogeneity, it is important to fully characterize the 
      developmental trajectory in Aicardi Goutières syndrome. To characterize the clinical 
      presentation in Aicardi Goutières syndrome, early features were collected from an 
      international cohort of children (n = 100) with genetically confirmed Aicardi 
      Goutières syndrome. There was a heterogeneous age of onset, with overlapping 
      clusters of presenting symptoms: altered mental status, systemic inflammatory 
      symptoms, and acute neurologic disability. Next, we created genotype-specific 
      developmental milestone acquisition curves. Individuals with microcephaly or 
      TREX1-related Aicardi Goutières syndrome secondary were the most severely affected 
      and less likely to reach milestones, including head control, sitting, and 
      nonspecific mama/dada. Individuals affected by SAMHD1, IFIH1, and ADAR attained the 
      most advanced milestones, with 44% achieving verbal communication and 31% 
      independently ambulating. Retrospective function scales (Gross Motor Function 
      Classification System, Manual Ability Classification System, and Communication 
      Function Classification System) demonstrated that two-thirds of the Aicardi 
      Goutières syndrome population are severely affected. Our results suggest 
      multifactorial influences on developmental trajectory, including a strong 
      contribution from genotype. Further studies are needed to identify the additional 
      factors that influence overall outcomes to better counsel families and to design 
      clinical trials with appropriate clinical endpoints.

TI  - Deletions and duplications of developmental pathway genes in 5q31 contribute to 
      abnormal phenotypes.
PG  - 1906-16
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.a.34100 [doi]
AB  - Although copy number changes of 5q31 have been rarely reported, deletions have been 
      associated with some common characteristics, such as short stature, failure to 
      thrive, developmental delay (DD)/intellectual disability (ID), club feet, dislocated 
      hips, and dysmorphic features. We report on three individuals with deletions and two 
      individuals with duplications at 5q31, ranging from 3.6 Mb to 8.1 Mb and 830 kb to 
      3.4 Mb in size, respectively. All five copy number changes are apparently de novo 
      and involve several genes that are important in developmental pathways, including 
      PITX1, SMAD5, and WNT8A. The individuals with deletions have characteristic features 
      including DD, short stature, club feet, cleft or high palate, dysmorphic features, 
      and skeletal anomalies. Haploinsufficiency of PITX1, a transcription factor 
      important for limb development, is likely the cause for the club feet, skeletal 
      anomalies, and cleft/high palate, while additional genes, including SMAD5 and WNT8A, 
      may also contribute to additional phenotypic features. Two patients with deletions 
      also presented with corneal anomalies. To identify a causative gene for the corneal 
      anomalies, we sequenced candidate genes in a family with apparent autosomal dominant 
      keratoconus with suggestive linkage to 5q31, but no mutations in candidate genes 
      were found. The duplications are smaller than the deletions, and the patients with 
      duplications have nonspecific features. Although development is likely affected by 
      increased dosage of the genes in the region, the developmental disruption appears 
      less severe than that seen with deletion.

TI  - Learning by observation and learning by doing in Prader-Willi syndrome.
PG  - 6
LID - 10.1186/s11689-015-9102-0 [doi]
LID - 6
AB  - BACKGROUND: New competencies may be learned through active experience (learning by 
      doing) or observation of others' experience (learning by observation). Observing 
      another person performing a complex action accelerates the observer's acquisition of 
      the same action, limiting the time-consuming process of learning by doing. Here, we 
      compared learning by observation and learning by doing in individuals with 
      Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). It is hypothesized that PWS individuals could show more 
      difficulties with learning by observation than learning by doing because of their 
      specific difficulty in interpreting and using social information. METHODS: The 
      performance of 24 PWS individuals was compared with that of 28 mental age (MA)- and 
      gender-matched typically developing (TD) children in tasks of learning a visuo-motor 
      sequence by observation or by doing. To determine whether the performance pattern 
      exhibited by PWS participants was specific to this population or whether it was a 
      nonspecific intellectual disability effect, we compared the PWS performances with 
      those of a third MA- and gender-matched group of individuals with Williams syndrome 
      (WS). RESULTS: PWS individuals were severely impaired in detecting a sequence by 
      observation, were able to detect a sequence by doing, and became as efficient as TD 
      children in reproducing an observed sequence after a task of learning by doing. The 
      learning pattern of PWS children was reversed compared with that of WS individuals. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The observational learning deficit in PWS individuals may be rooted, at 
      least partially, in their incapacity to understand and/or use social information.

TI  - A patient with unusual features and a 69.5 Mb duplication from a de novo extra der 
      (9): a case report.
PG  - 155-8
LID - 10.3892/mmr.2015.3436 [doi]
AB  - Partial trisomy 9 is a common autosomal trisomy, which is characterized by 
      non-specific psychomotor delay, mental retardation and moderately abnormal 
      characteristic facial features. Generally, partial trisomy 9 leads to variable 
      phenotypes depending on the size and position of the duplicated region. However, a 
      precise genotype/phenotype map has not been determined. The present study reports 
      the case of a 3-year-old female with certain typical features of trisomy 9p 
      syndrome, who presented with a number of the distinctive symptoms, as well as 
      sensorineural hearing loss, which has not previously been associated with this 
      trisomy. Karyotype, M‑FISH and OaCGH analysis were performed on the patient and her 
      parents. The final karyotype was determined to be 47, XX, +mar.ish der (9) (wcp9+). 
      arr cgh 9pterq21.12 (DOCK8 → LOC138225)x3. Cytogenetic results showed a de novo 
      extra der (9) with 69.5 Mb duplication. Although the molecular mechanism underlying 
      the hearing loss is unclear, it was proposed that the 9q13 → 9q21 region may be 
      critical for hearing.

TI  - Simple and choice reaction time performance in SIV-infected rhesus macaques.
PG  - 571-83
AB  - It is well established that HIV infection can lead to motor/cognitive disorders in 
      humans. A number of studies have shown that simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) 
      infection in rhesus macaques parallels many aspects of HIV disease in humans. The 
      purpose of this study was to define further the SIV-infected rhesus macaque as a 
      model of neuro-AIDS. Our objective was to detect movement-related impairments in 
      behaviorally trained, SIV-infected macaques using both simple and choice reaction 
      time tasks. Reaction times (RTs), movement times (MTs), and error types were 
      examined. Nine monkeys were infected with neurovirulent strains of SIVmac, four of 
      which served initially as controls before their inoculation. Seven of the nine 
      monkeys developed simian AIDS within 4 months of inoculation (rapid progressors), 
      while two monkeys survived for more than 1 year postinoculation (slow progressors). 
      Of the rapid progressors, four exhibited slowed reaction times and six showed 
      movement time slowing. One rapid progressor showed evidence of a strategy shift to 
      overcome impaired motor abilities. Monkeys with rapidly progressing SIV-related 
      disease consistently show behavioral abnormalities reflecting underlying neuronal 
      injury. Although the slow progressors also showed RT and/or MT slowing, a role for 
      nonspecific factors related to late-stage simian AIDS could not be ruled out in 
      these cases. The results demonstrate that motor impairments associated with SIV 
      infection in rhesus macaques can be detected using RT and MT measures, further 
      establishing the SIVmac-infected macaque monkey as a viable model of neuro-AIDS.

TI  - Terminal 22q deletion syndrome: a newly recognized cause of speech and language 
      disability in the autism spectrum.
PG  - 451-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Cryptic subtelomeric chromosome rearrangements account for 6% to 10% of 
      idiopathic mental retardation. As cytogenetic and molecular techniques have become 
      more sophisticated, the number of genetic syndromes attributed to these 
      microdeletions has increased. To date, 64 patients have been described in the 
      literature with a more recently recognized microdeletion syndrome, del 22q13.3. The 
      purpose of this study is to present 11 new cases of this recently described syndrome 
      to delineate further the phenotype and to alert the clinician to another genetic 
      condition that should be considered in the differential diagnosis of early 
      hypotonia, delayed speech acquisition, and autistic behavior. METHODS: Eleven 
      patients were evaluated in 3 academic institutions. Clinical features and results of 
      cytogenetic testing were recorded and tabulated. Reasons for referral for genetic 
      evaluation included developmental delay, severe expressive speech and language 
      delay, and dysmorphic features. RESULTS: Age of presentation ranged from 5 months to 
      46 years. There were 10 female patients and 1 male patient. All of the patients 
      exhibited delayed motor development, some degree of hypotonia, and severe expressive 
      speech and language delay. Dysmorphic facial features included epicanthal folds, 
      large cupped ears, underdeveloped philtrum, loss of cupid's bow, and full 
      supraorbital ridges. Six patients exhibited autistic-like behaviors. Microscopically 
      visible chromosome deletions were observed in 6 patients. In the remainder, the 
      deletion was detected with the use of fluorescence in situ hybridization. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Hypotonia and developmental delay are nonspecific findings observed in 
      many malformation and genetic syndromes. However, in association with severe speech 
      and language delay and autistic-like behavior, this phenotype may be a significant 
      indication to consider the 22q13 deletion syndrome as a potential cause.

TI  - A preliminary report on dopamine system reactivity in PKU: acute effects of 
      haloperidol on neuropsychological, physiological, and neuroendocrine functions.
PG  - 18-25
AB  - BACKGROUND: Classic phenylketonuria (PKU) is due to an inborn error of metabolism 
      resulting in an inability to metabolize the amino acid phenylalanine. To avoid 
      mental retardation, affected individuals observe a phenylalanine-restricted diet. 
      When dietary control is poor, deficits in prefrontally mediated cognitive functions 
      have been observed. It has been suggested that these deficits are due to disruptions 
      in the mesocortical dopamine system that projects to the prefrontal cortex. METHODS: 
      In this study, dopamine system reactivity was examined in individuals with PKU, 
      relative to age-matched controls, using the non-specific DA antagonist haloperidol, 
      in a repeated measures placebo-controlled design. Outcome variables included 
      neuroendocrine, physiological, and cognitive measures. RESULTS: Regardless of drug 
      condition, PKU participants differed from control participants in their blood 
      phenylalanine and tyrosine levels, and in their times to complete measures of 
      attention and working memory. Also, relative to placebo, haloperidol influenced 
      several variables irrespective of group status, including serum prolactin secretion, 
      times to complete attention and working memory tasks, and accuracy of working memory 
      performance. An interaction between group and drug condition was observed for the 
      digit span task, where PKU participants exhibited greater relative impairments on 
      haloperidol. When composite indices of impairment were derived, PKU participants 
      demonstrated selective disruption in executive function on haloperidol relative to 
      control subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Findings are consistent with the presence of 
      frontostriatal dysfunction in PKU but are less consistent with the notion that PFC 
      dopamine function is specifically affected.

TI  - GABA and epileptogenesis: comparing gabrb3 gene-deficient mice with Angelman 
      syndrome in man.
PG  - 123-32
AB  - The GABAergic system has long been implicated in epilepsy with defects in GABA 
      neurotransmission being linked to epilepsy in both experimental animal models and 
      human syndromes (Olsen and Avoli, 1997). However, to date no human epileptic 
      syndrome has been directly attributed to an altered GABAergic system. The observed 
      defects in GABA neurotransmission in human epileptic syndromes may be the indirect 
      result of a brain besieged by seizures. The use of animal models of epilepsy has 
      sought to address these matters. The advent of gene targeting methodologies in mice 
      now allows for a more direct assessment of GABA's involvement in epileptogenesis. To 
      date several genes associated with the GABAergic system have been disrupted. These 
      include the genes for glutamic acid decarboxylase, both the 65- and 67-kDa isoforms 
      (GAD65 and GAD67), the tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase gene (TNAP) and 
      genes for the GABA(A) receptor subunits alpha6, beta3, gamma2, and delta (gabra6, 
      gabrb3, gabrg2, and gabrd respectively). Gene disruptions of either GAD67 or gabrg2 
      result in neonatal lethality, while others, GAD65, TNAP, and gabrb3 exhibit 
      increased mortality and spontaneous seizures. GABA receptor expression has been 
      found to be both regionally and developmentally regulated. Thus in addition to their 
      obvious role in controlling excitability in adult brain, a deficit in GABAergic 
      function during development could be expected to elicit pleiotropic 
      neurodevelopmental abnormalities perhaps including epilepsy. The GABA(A) receptor 
      beta3 subunit gene, gabrb3/GABRB3 (mouse/human), is of particular interest because 
      of its expression early in development and its possible role in the 
      neurodevelopmental disorder Angelman syndrome. Individuals with this syndrome 
      exhibit severe mental retardation and epilepsy. Mice with the gabrb3 gene disrupted 
      likewise exhibit electroencephalograph (EEG) abnormalities, seizures, and behavioral 
      characteristics typically associated with Angelman syndrome. These gabrb3 gene 
      knockout mice provide direct evidence that a reduction of a specific subunit of the 
      GABA(A) receptor system can result in epilepsy and support a GABAergic role in the 
      pathophysiology of Angelman syndrome.

TI  - [Effect of nonspecific malnutrition on spine morphology of lamina V pyramidal cells 
      of the cingulate area of juvenile and adult rats].
PG  - 617-31
AB  - The spine morphology of LV--pyramidal neurons in the cingulate cortex was analyzed, 
      using drawings of apical side dendrites without ramifications, by light 
      microscopical analysis of 5300 times magnification in GOLGI-preparations of the 
      brains of 11 and 60 days old control rats as well as of experimental animals reared 
      under starvation conditions from day 1 till day 60 of their postnatal life. The 
      spine density and the relative frequency of three different spine types (thin, 
      mushroom and stubby shaped) was estimated in control and undernourished animals. 
      Undernutrition resulted in a considerable deficit in the spine number of 25% in 11 
      days old animals, respectively, of 41% in 60 days old animals. Additionally, in 60 
      days old undernourished rats changes in the relative frequency of the three spine 
      types was found. To the thin type belonged 46% (68% in controls) to the mushroom 
      shaped form 37% (19% in controls) and to the stubby type 16% (13% in controls) of 
      all visible spines. This pattern in 60 days old undernourished rats was very similar 
      to the pattern of 11 days old control animals (thin 43%, mushroom 36%, stubby 22%). 
      The evaluate the differentiation of the dendritic spines during ontogenesis as well 
      as the disturbing influence of undernutrition on these processes, additional data of 
      the spine morphology (neck length and head area) were collected. The spines of the 
      11 days old animals showed a larger head area (undernourished and controls) than the 
      young adult ones. However, the thin spine type present in 60 days old undernourished 
      rats exhibits morphological features (extremely long necks of about 2,5 micron in 
      comparison to 1,6 micron in controls as well as very large heads) which appeared to 
      be quite similar to the thin and long spine type observed by PURPURA (1975) in human 
      fetal cortex and in cortex of patients with mental retardation. This super long thin 
      spine type is considered to be a less ripe stage of the spine development. The 
      relative high portion of mushroom and stubby shaped spines in undernourished and 
      young animals points to the same assumption or to degenerative changes in the 
      experimental animals.

PG  - 69

AB  - BACKGROUND: De novo variants in the voltage-gated calcium channel subunit α1 E gene 
      (CACNA1E) have been described as causative of epileptic encephalopathy with 
      contractures, macrocephaly and dyskinesias. METHODS: Following the observation of an 
      index patient with developmental delay and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) without 
      seizures who had a de novo deleterious CACNA1E variant, we screened GeneMatcher for 
      other individuals with CACNA1E variants and neurodevelopmental phenotypes without 
      epilepsy. The spectrum of pathogenic CACNA1E variants was compared to the mutational 
      landscape of variants in the gnomAD control population database. RESULTS: We 
      identified seven unrelated individuals with intellectual disability, developmental 
      regression and ASD-like behavioral profile, and notably without epilepsy, who had de 
      novo heterozygous putatively pathogenic variants in CACNA1E. Age of onset of 
      clinical manifestation, presence or absence of regression and degree of severity 
      were variable, and no clear-cut genotype-phenotype association could be recognized. 
      The analysis of disease-associated variants and their comparison to benign variants 
      from the control population allowed for the identification of regions in the CACNA1E 
      protein that seem to be intolerant to substitutions and thus more likely to harbor 
      pathogenic variants. As in a few reported cases with CACNA1E variants and epilepsy, 
      one patient showed a positive clinical behavioral response to topiramate, a specific 
      calcium channel modulator. LIMITATIONS: The significance of our study is limited by 
      the absence of functional experiments of the effect of identified variants, the 
      small sample size and the lack of systematic ASD assessment in all participants. 
      Moreover, topiramate was given to one patient only and for a short period of time. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that CACNA1E variants may result in 
      neurodevelopmental disorders without epilepsy and expand the mutational and 
      phenotypic spectrum of this gene. CACNA1E deserves to be included in gene panels for 
      non-specific developmental disorders, including ASD, and not limited to patients 
      with seizures, to improve diagnostic recognition and explore the possible efficacy 
      of topiramate.

TI  - Brains that are out of tune but in time.
PG  - 356-60
AB  - It is estimated that about 4% of the general population may have amusia (or tone 
      deafness). Congenital amusia is a lifelong disability for processing music despite 
      normal intellectual, memory, and language skills. Here we present evidence that the 
      disorder stems from a deficit in fine-grained pitch perception. Amusic and control 
      adults were presented with monotonic and isochronous sequences of five tones (i.e., 
      constant pitch and intertone interval). They were required to detect when the fourth 
      tone was displaced in pitch or time. All amusic participants were impaired in 
      detecting the pitch changes, and showed no sign of improvement with practice. In 
      contrast, they detected time changes as well as control adults and exhibited similar 
      improvements with practice. Thus, the degraded pitch perception seen in the amusic 
      individuals cannot be ascribed to nonspecific problems with the task or to poor 
      hearing in general. Rather, the data point to the presence of a congenital neural 
      anomaly that selectively impairs pitch processing.

TI  - Immediate suppression of seizure clusters by corticosteroids in PCDH19 female 
      epilepsy.
PG  - 1-5

LID - 10.1016/j.seizure.2015.02.006 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The pathomechanism and treatment of PCDH19 female epilepsy (PCDH19-FE) 
      remain unclear. Here, we report that corticosteroids are effective for control of 
      the seizure clusters or other acute symptoms of PCDH19-FE and argue for the possible 
      involvement of a compromised blood-brain barrier (BBB) in its pathogenesis. METHODS: 
      The efficacy of corticosteroids was retrospectively reviewed in five Japanese 
      patients with PCDH19-FE. The results of antibody assays against the 
      N-methyl-d-aspartate-type glutamate receptor (abs-NR) in serum/cerebrospinal fluid 
      were also compiled. RESULTS: Corticosteroid treatments significantly improved the 
      acute symptoms, including seizure clusters, in all cases, most often immediately 
      after the initial administration. However, the effect was transient, and some 
      seizures recurred within a few weeks, especially in association with fever. Serum 
      and/or cerebrospinal fluid abs-NR were detected in all patients. Target sequences of 
      the detected antibodies were multiple, and the titers tended to decrease over time. 
      In one patient, immunohistochemical analysis using rat hippocampal slices also 
      revealed serum antibodies targeting an unknown epitope in neuronal cytoplasm. 
      CONCLUSION: Our findings imply an involvement of inflammatory processes in the 
      pathogenesis of PCDH19-FE and therapeutic utility for corticosteroids as an 
      adjunctive option in acute treatment. PCDH19 is well expressed in brain 
      microvascular endothelial cells and thus its impairment may cause BBB vulnerability, 
      which may be ameliorated by corticosteroids. The abs-NR detected in our patients may 
      not indicate an autoimmune pathomechanism, but may rather represent non-specific 
      sensitization to degraded neuronal components entering the general circulation, the 
      latter process facilitated by the BBB vulnerability.

AB  - Insulinomas are functional neuroendocrine pancreatic tumors rarely encountered in 
      pediatric pathology. Insulinomas are usually solitary and sporadic, but may occur in 
      association with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1. Whipple's triad-hypoglycemia, 
      simultaneous compatible adrenergic and/or neurological signs, and relief of symptoms 
      upon the administration of glucose-remains the fundamental diagnostic tool. We 
      report a case of insulinoma in an 11-year-old boy with malnutrition and mild psychic 
      retardation. History revealed neuroglycopenic symptoms associated with hypoglycemia 
      that returned to normal values after glucose intravenous infusion; before admission 
      in our unit, the levels of circulating insulin, as well as the abdominal ultrasound 
      and abdominal computed tomography scan, were reported within normal range. During 
      hospitalization in our service, the glycemic curves showed recurring low values 
      associated with low glycated hemoglobin, positive fasting test, and elevated 
      C-peptide. The pancreatic ultrasound was inconclusive, but the magnetic resonance 
      imaging revealed a high signal focal area with a diameter of 1 cm, located in the 
      tail of pancreas. Conventional enucleation of the lesion prompted a spectacular 
      normalization of glucose metabolism and the alleviation of the main clinical 
      symptoms. The child had a favorable evolution in the clinical follow-up, presenting 
      with weight gain and progressive remission to complete disappearance of most 
      symptoms-except for the mental impairments. Although in our case Whipple's triad was 
      apparent from the beginning, the diagnosis was delayed due to the failure of 
      conventional imaging methods in locating the tumor. Weight loss and mental 
      impairment contributed to the diagnosis pitfalls. Pediatricians should be aware of 
      confusing and nonspecific symptoms, especially when children with insulinoma present 
      mental or neurological retardation. Despite the existence of medical regimens, 
      surgery remains the gold standard for the therapeutic approach to this condition.

TI  - Primary ovarian insufficiency in a female with phosphomannomutase-2 gene (PMM2) 
      mutations for congenital disorder of glycosylation.
PG  - 605-611
LID - 10.1507/endocrj.EJ20-0706 [doi]
AB  - Primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) is a highly heterogeneous condition, and its 
      underlying causes remain to be clarified in a large fraction of patients. Congenital 
      disorders of glycosylation (CDG) are multisystem diseases caused by mutations of a 
      number of genes involved in N-glycosylation or O-glycosylation, and the most 
      frequent form is PMM2-CDG (alias, CDG-Ia) resulting from biallelic mutations in PMM2 
      encoding phosphomannomutase-2 involved in N-glycosylation. Here, we examined a 46,XX 
      Japanese female with syndromic POI accompanied by an undetectable level of serum 
      anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH). Whole exome sequencing identified biallelic pathogenic 
      mutations of PMM2 (a novel c.34G>C:p.(Asp12His) of maternal origin and a recurrent 
      c.310C>G:p.(Leu104Val) of paternal origin) (NM_000303.3), and N-glycosylation 
      studies detected asialotransferrin and disialotransferrin characteristic of 
      PMM2-CDG, in addition to normally glycosylated tetrasialotransferrin. Clinical 
      assessment showed cerebellar hypotrophy, which is a fairly characteristic and highly 
      prevalent feature in PMM2-CDG, together with multiple non-specific features reported 
      in PMM2-CDG such as characteristic face, intellectual disability, skeletal 
      abnormalities, and low blood antithrombin III value. These results including the 
      undetectable level of serum AMH, in conjunction with previously reported findings 
      suggestive of the critical role of glycosylation in oocyte development and function, 
      imply that PMM2-CDG almost invariably leads to POI primarily because of the 
      defective oogenesis and/or oocyte-dependent early folliculogenesis rather than the 
      compromised bioactivity of FSH/LH with defective glycosylation. Thus, it is 
      recommended to examine PMM2 in patients with syndromic POI, especially in those with 
      cerebellar ataxia/hypotrophy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cerebral Creatine deficiency syndromes (CCDS) include three hereditary 
      diseases affecting the metabolism of creatine (Cr): arginine glycine 
      amidinotransferase deficiency, guanidinoacetate methyltransferase deficiency and 
      disorders of creatine transporter. These pathologies cause a brain creatine 
      deficiency responsible of non-specific neurological impairments with mental 
      retardation. LC-MS/MS measurements of guanidinoacetic acid (GAA) and creatine in 
      urine and plasma are an important screening test to identify the deficit. Analysis 
      of this polar and basic molecules not hold on standard column requires a 
      derivatization step to butyl-esters. To overcome this long and fastidious 
      derivatization, an ion pairing (IP) method was chosen in this study. METHOD: IP 
      method was validated using Comité francais d'accréditation (COFRAC) recommendations. 
      Then, urine GAA and creatine of 15 patients with a CDS deficiency suspected were 
      tested y LC-MS/MS using IP technique, and performances were assessed with reference 
      laboratory method (butylation method). Moreover, references values were suggested y 
      the study of 100 urines samples of healthy patients. RESULTS: The method developed 
      provided a good accuracy and precision with intra and inter-day coefficients of 
      variation (CVs) <15%. The curve was linear for the biological and pathological 
      concentrations. The comparison with the reference method did not reveal any 
      significant difference for analytical performances but showed a simplification of 
      the preparation of samples. CONCLUSION: The use of IP technique that we have 
      developed demonstrated a good correlation with the butylation method. Moreover, this 
      new method not only allows a simplification of the technique, but also decreases in 
      run time.

TI  - Succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency in children and adults.
PG  - S73-80
AB  - Succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency is a rare disorder of the degradation 
      pathway of gamma-aminobutyric acid. The disorder is detected when 4-hydroxybutyric 
      aciduria is present on urine organic acid analysis, and is subsequently confirmed by 
      enzyme measurement on leucocytes. The disorder has been identified in approximately 
      350 individuals worldwide. We review the clinical features in 60 patients. The most 
      common characteristics are developmental delay maximally involving expressive 
      language, hypotonia, mental retardation, ataxia, and behavioral problems. Seizures 
      occur in approximately half of patients, and include tonic-clonic, absence, and 
      myoclonic seizures, including status epilepticus. Electroencephalographic findings 
      are background slowing and generalized and focal epileptiform discharges. Magnetic 
      resonance imaging typically reveals increased T2-weighted signal of the globus 
      pallidus bilaterally, with variable involvement of white matter and the cerebellar 
      dentate nucleus. Preliminary human cerebrospinal fluid measurements are consistent 
      with neurometabolic aberrations documented in the murine animal model, with 
      elevations in gamma-aminobutyric acid, gamma-hydroxybutyrate, and homocarnosine, and 
      low glutamine. Succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency may be an 
      underrecognized neurometabolic disorder with a nonspecific and wide phenotypic 
      spectrum, and carries implications for a comprehensive fundamental understanding of 
      interrelations between multiple neurotransmitter systems.

TI  - Differential nuclear ATRX expression in sarcomas.
PG  - 738-45
LID - 10.1111/his.12812 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Nuclear α-thalassemia/mental retardation X-linked (ATRX) loss and alternative 
      lengthening of telomeres (ALT) are linked in distinct malignancies. We therefore 
      aimed to determine the nuclear ATRX expression correlated with ALT in a 
      comprehensive series of sarcomas. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 573 formalin-fixed 
      paraffin-embedded sarcomas comprising 28 entities were investigated for nuclear ATRX 
      expression by immunohistochemistry. Telomere-specific fluorescence in-situ 
      hybridization (FISH) was used to determine the ALT phenotype in 50 sarcomas with 
      complete or heterogeneous ATRX loss. Complete nuclear ATRX loss was detected in 58 
      of 573 sarcomas, all high-grade, with the highest prevalence in undifferentiated 
      pleomorphic sarcomas (38%) and pleomorphic liposarcomas (38%), followed by 
      dedifferentiated liposarcomas (24%), osteosarcomas (21%), leiomyosarcomas (17%), 
      myxofibrosarcomas (11%) and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours (4%). 
      Interestingly, a further 20 sarcomas, all belonging to the aforementioned entities 
      with complete ATRX loss, presented with a heterogeneous ATRX expression pattern. ALT 
      was observed in 41 of 42 sarcomas with complete ATRX loss, but only in two of eight 
      sarcomas with heterogeneous expression. CONCLUSION: Nuclear ATRX loss, either 
      complete or heterogeneous, is encountered in a considerable number of high-grade 
      sarcomas with non-specific genetic alterations. A causal relationship with ALT might 
      be indicated at least in cases with a complete nuclear ATRX loss.

TI  - The prevalence and clinical impact of pulmonary artery sling on school-aged 
      children: a large-scale screening study.
PG  - 656-61
LID - 10.1002/ppul.20823 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Airway obstruction is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in 
      patients with pulmonary artery sling (PAS). Early identification of PAS is 
      imperative for prompt initiation of appropriate treatments. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was 
      to investigate the prevalence and clinical impact of PAS on school-aged children 
      through a large-scale pre-sports participation cardiovascular screening (PPCVS) 
      study. METHODS: A total of 186,213 school-aged children underwent portable 
      two-dimensional echocardiography (2DE) study in a PPCVS study between 2001 and 2004 
      in Taichung City, Taiwan. We prospectively collected data on the prevalence of PSA, 
      demographics, clinical features, tracheo-bronchial anomalies (TBA), on computed 
      tomography (CT), pulmonary function test (PFT), follow-up data in 1 year, and 
      clinical outcomes. RESULTS: PAS was identified in 11 children (8 males/3 females) 
      with a median age of 13 years (range: 7.2-13.7 years). The prevalence of PAS was 1 
      in 17,000 school-aged children. The majority of children with PAS had recurrent 
      broncho-pulmonary infections (90.9%) and asthmatic cough (81.8%), which had a low 
      positive predictive value of PAS (<1%). Seven patients had diffused complete 
      cartilaginous rings. The other four patients were found to have prominent localized 
      external compression of the trachea or bronchus. No coexisting intracardiac 
      anomalies were found. Two patients had mental retardation. Seven patients underwent 
      surgical correction without mortality or major complications. After surgery, 
      significant improvement in PFT was shown in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) 
      and functional vital capacity (FVC). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to 
      determine the prevalence of PAS as 59 per million school-aged children by a 
      large-scale screening using 2DE. Although the majority of children with PAS have 
      associated TBA and impaired pulmonary function, all patients with PAS were 
      unrecognized due to non-specific symptoms. Early identification of PAS and surgery 
      result in significant improvement in pulmonary function.

TI  - The neurobiology and genetics of infantile autism.
PG  - 87-129
AB  - Autism is a syndrome with multiple etiologies, as is made clear both by the evidence 
      of neurobiological research and by the catalog of disorders that present with 
      autistic behaviors. What remains unclear are the specific neuropathological 
      mechanisms that produce autistic behaviors; for example, is there a common 
      neuroanatomic pathology for all cases of autism, or can autistic behaviors emerge 
      from different pathological sequences within the brain? Although it is premature to 
      generalize, neuropathological studies appear to have identified common abnormalities 
      in the cerebellum and limbic system of at least five autistic subjects. These 
      subjects, with variable levels of mental retardation, demonstrated marked Purkinje 
      cell loss in the cerebellar hemispheres, together with retained fetal neuronal 
      circuitry in cerebellar nuclei and increased neuronal packing in specific regions of 
      the limbic system, amygdala, and hippocampus. The architecture of the cerebral 
      cortex was not affected. Although our knowledge of brain functioning is incomplete, 
      alterations of the kind noted in the cerebellum and limbic system could reasonably 
      produce autistic behaviors. For more detail, readers are directed to a review of 
      cerebellar contributions to higher functions by Schmahmann (1991). Neuroimaging 
      studies allow less resolution of brain structure than do neuroanatomic studies, and 
      the reported findings from neuroimaging are somewhat contradictory. However, a 
      number of investigators have reported structural abnormalities in ventricle size and 
      cerebral hemispheric asymmetry using CT. MRI, which offers greater resolution, has 
      uncovered some consistent findings, along with a variety of nonspecific 
      abnormalities. Common abnormalities include reduced volume of cerebellar hemispheres 
      and vermal lobules--findings not inconsistent with the above-mentioned 
      neuropathological defects. It is also interesting to note that individuals with 
      fragile X syndrome have similar cerebellar findings. PET and NMR studies of autism 
      are at a preliminary stage, but these methodologies allow insight into the 
      functioning of the brain, rather than simply brain anatomy. Recent PET studies 
      indicating decreased association between paired regions of the brains of autistic 
      subjects are of interest, particularly if they can be confirmed and refined by 
      additional studies. Neurophysiological studies also offer insight into brain 
      function, but are subject to numerous methodological criticisms. Nevertheless, 
      recent reports of diminished P300 waves and absent NC components in autistic 
      subjects seem to indicate fundamental defects in attention and secondary processing, 
      which could help explain the self-stimulatory behaviors often seen in autism. The 
      disturbances in brain development associated with autism can be produced in a number 
      of ways, and at different times during development of the nervous system.(ABSTRACT

TI  - Celiac disease and headache in children: a narrative state of the art.
PG  - e2020056
LID - 10.23750/abm.v91i3.8224 [doi]
AB  - Celiac disease (CD) is one of the most important entity of the wide spectrum of 
      gluten-related disorders (GRDs). It is well known that neurological manifestation 
      can be present either at the onset of CD, or appear during the development of the 
      pathology, and different can be the neurologic findings. Clinical features are very 
      variable, ranging from typical manifestations of gastrointestinal involvement to 
      neurologic symptom. The most frequent neurologic signs reported were headache, 
      epileptic seizure, migraine, mental retardation, ataxia and attention deficit and 
      hyperactive disorder. Headache either in form of migraine, or in non-specific form 
      represents one of the main clinical presentation in CD. The aim of this work is to 
      provide a narrative review of the pediatric literature focused on the cephalalgic 
      features of children with CD evaluating the potential benefits of a gluten free diet 
      (GFD).  Papers were identified by searching for related literature in Medline 
      (PubMed) and Embase using the words "Celiac Disease" and "Headache" or "Migraine" by 
      specifying "children"/"paediatric age" for reports published since 1972 till 31th 
      October 2018. According to our inclusion criteria, a total of 25 papers has been 
      evaluated. Although it is still controversial if headache is prevalent in CD 
      children a correct compliance to a GFD seems to improve the neurological symptoms 
      even if the underlying pathogenic relationship between CD and neurologic system 
      involvement is still not fully understood.

TI  - Prenatal phenotype of Kabuki syndrome: A case series and literature review.
PG  - 1089-1100
LID - 10.1002/pd.5998 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Kabuki syndrome (KS) is a genetic disorder characterized by intellectual 
      disability, facial dysmorphism and congenital anomalies. We aim to investigate the 
      prenatal features of fetuses with KS and to provide a comprehensive review of the 
      literature on prenatal sonographic abnormalities associated with KS. METHODS: We 
      retrospectively reviewed the prenatal ultrasound findings of all mothers of children 
      with molecularly confirmed KS in Hong Kong, between 1991 and 2019. We also performed 
      systematic review of the literature to identify studies on the prenatal findings in 
      KS. RESULTS: We identified 11 cases with KS with detectable fetal ultrasound 
      findings ranging from no detectable abnormalities to a variety of non-specific 
      findings including increased nuchal translucency, pleural effusion, cardiac 
      anomalies, renal anomalies, intrauterine growth restriction, polyhydramnios, 
      oligohydramnios and single umbilical artery. In combining our cases with the 77 
      cases published, 42 (50.6%) of them had more than one abnormal antenatal ultrasound 
      finding. The most frequent ultrasound features observed were cardiac anomalies 
      (49.4%), followed by polyhydramnios (28.9%), genitourinary anomalies (26.5%), single 
      umbilical artery (15.7%), intrauterine growth restriction (14.5%) and hydrops 
      fetalis/pleural effusion/ascites (12.0%). CONCLUSIONS: These cases demonstrate the 
      prenatal phenotypic heterogeneity associated with KS. Although the ultrasound 
      abnormalities are non-specific, KS should be considered in the differential 
      diagnosis when these fetal findings following normal microarray 
      analysis/karyotyping.

TI  - Electroclinical variability of pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy caused by ALDH7A1 gene 
      mutations in four Taiwanese children.

LID - S0387-7604(20)30069-3 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.braindev.2020.02.005 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to describe the electroclinical variability of 
      four Taiwanese patients with pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy (PDE) caused by ALDH7A1 
      gene mutations. METHODS: Demographic data, case histories, clinical seizure 
      patterns, EEG features, neuroimaging findings, ALDH7A1 gene mutations, treatments, 
      and neurodevelopmental outcomes of the four patients were collected and analyzed. 
      RESULTS: The four patients exhibited the first symptom between the ages of 6 days 
      and 11 months. The age of diagnosis was between 2 months and 13 years 8 months. 
      Patient 1 exhibited classical phenotype of PDE, neonatal onset epileptic 
      encephalopathy. Patient 2 showed atypical phenotypes of intractable epilepsy with 
      additional neurological and abdominal symptoms. Patients 3 and 4, who had normal 
      neurodevelopment, had familial epilepsy with fever sensitivity. Patients 2, 3, and 4 
      had atypical phenotypes and showed seizure exacerbation during febrile infections. 
      EEG features of patient 1 revealed alternating rhythmic discharges followed by 
      electrodecremental episodes; while those of patients 2, 3, and 4 disclosed 
      nonspecific findings or normal results. Administration of oral pyridoxine 
      hydrochloride resulted in seizure cessation in patients 1, 3, and 4, and they 
      achieved normal neurodevelopmental outcomes, but intractable epilepsy and profound 
      mental retardation occurred in patient 2 as he was not diagnosed until he was 
      13 years and 8 months old. CONCLUSION: Electroclinical features of PDE vary widely, 
      including patients with normal neurodevelopment and normal or nonspecific EEG 
      findings. To avoid delay in treatment, a therapeutic trial with pyridoxine 
      hydrochloride should be performed in all cases of neonatal, infantile, and childhood 
      refractory epilepsy until ALDH7A1 gene mutation-related PDE has been excluded. 
      Pyridoxine treatment may show clinical effectiveness even in a relatively late 
      stage, i.e., age older than one year.

AB  - We report the case of a 14-year-old girl suffering from severe developmental visual 
      impairment along with delayed language and cognitive development, and featuring a 
      clear-cut dissociation between spared dorsal and impaired ventral visual pathways. 
      Visual recognition of objects, including faces and printed words, was affected. In 
      contrast, movement perception and visually guided motor control were preserved. 
      Structural MRI was normal on inspection, but Voxel Based Morphometry (VBM) revealed 
      reduced grey matter density in the mesial occipital and ventral occipito-temporal 
      cortex. Functional MRI during the perception of line drawings uncovered impaired 
      differentiation which is normally observed at even younger ages: no local category 
      preferences could be identified within the occipito-temporal cortex for faces, 
      houses, words or tools. In contrast, movement-related activations appeared to be 
      normal. Finally, those abnormalities evolved on the background of chronic bilateral 
      occipital epileptic activity, including continuous spike-wave discharges during 
      sleep, which may be considered as the primary cause of non-specific intellectual 
      disability and visual impairment.

AB  - Objective: To establish and broaden the phenotypic spectrum of secretory carrier 
      membrane protein (SCAMP5) associated with epilepsy and neurodevelopmental delay. 
      Methods: A Chinese patient was identified at the First Hospital of Peking 
      University, and the three unrelated patients were recruited from two different 
      countries (Italy and United States) through GeneMatcher. SCAMP5 pathogenic variants 
      were identified by whole exome sequencing; clinical data of the patients were 
      retrospectively collected and analyzed. Result: The onset age of seizures was ranged 
      from 6 to 15 months. Patients had different types of seizures, including focal 
      seizures, generalized tonic-clonic seizures and tonic seizure. One patient showed 
      typical autism spectrum disorder (ASD) symptoms. Electroencephalogram (EEG) findings 
      presented as focal or multifocal discharges, sometimes spreading to generalization. 
      Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) abnormalities were present in each patient. 
      Severe intellectual disability and language and motor developmental disorders were 
      found in our patients, with all patients having poor language development and were 
      nonverbal at last follow-up. All but one of the patients could walk independently in 
      childhood, but the ability to walk independently in one patient had deteriorated 
      with age. All patients had abnormal neurological exam findings, mostly signs of 
      extrapyramidal system involvement. Dysmorphic features were found in 2/4 patients, 
      mainly in the face and trunk. All four unrelated patients were found to have the 
      same heterozygous pathogenic SCAMP5 de novo variant (p. Gly180Trp). Conclusion: 
      Epilepsy, severe developmental delay, abnormal neurological exam findings, with or 
      without ASD or variably dysmorphic features and were common in patients with SCAMP5 
      variant. The onset time and type of seizure varied greatly. The EEG and brain MRI 
      findings were not consistent, but diverse and nonspecific. The motor ability of 
      patients with heterozygous SCAMP5 variant might have a regressive course; language 
      development was more severely affected.

TI  - Microscopically controlled surgical excision combined with ultrapulse CO2 
      vaporization in the management of a patient with the nevoid basal cell carcinoma 
      syndrome.
PG  - 10-2
AB  - Nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome is an autosomal dominant condition 
      characterized by multiple basal cell carcinomas, skeletal abnormalities and 
      sometimes mental retardation. The large number of tumors, which are often 
      disfiguring, presents extreme difficulties in the treatment of these patients. 
      Microscopically controlled excision, compared to other modalities (radiation 
      therapy, photodynamic therapy, intralesional interferon alpha-2b) offers the highest 
      cure rate. However, because of the large size and involvement of wide areas of the 
      skin, this approach is sometimes impractical. The ultrapulse CO2 laser with high 
      energy and short pulses achieves char-free ablation of the tumors, bloodless 
      surgical field, minimal nonspecific thermal damage, rapid healing and diminished 
      postoperative pain. Also, a number of lesions can be removed in a single session. We 
      present a 48-year-old man with a 6.5 x 4.5 cm large basal cell carcinoma involving 
      the anterior abdomen and navel area. The central thick portion of the tumor was 
      resected by microscopically controlled excision with 3 stages, and wide thinner 
      peripheral crescentic plaque vaporized with ultrapulse CO2 laser. The laser settings 
      were 300 mJ energy/pulse and 100 W average power, which corresponds to the fluence 
      of 7.5 J/cm2. Computerized pattern generator (ultrascan handpiece) was adjusted to 
      patterns of 3 (circle) and 1 (square) with sizes varying from 5 to 7, and density of 
      9 (60% overlapping). The tumor was vaporized with 6 passes, all the way to deep 
      reticular dermis. A fifteen month-follow up disclosed no recurrent disease. 
      Subsequent biopsies revealed only a scar with postinflammatory hyperpigmentation. 
      Our experience indicates that combined treatment with microscopically controlled 
      excision and ultrapulse CO2 laser ablation is a suitable modality for the large 
      tumor plaques involving concave and convex areas of the skin respectively. 
      Microscopically controlled excision of thicker, concave portions of basal cell 
      carcinoma plaques, where CO2 laser surgery is less feasible, presents an effective 
      addition that renders this combined modality a successful method for the treatment 
      of nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome.

TI  - Phenotypic spectrum associated with de novo and inherited deletions and duplications 
      at 16p11.2 in individuals ascertained for diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder.
PG  - 195-203
LID - 10.1136/jmg.2009.069369 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recurrent microdeletions and microduplications of approximately 555 kb 
      at 16p11.2 confer susceptibility to autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in up to 1% of 
      ASD patients. No physical or behavioural features have been identified that 
      distinguish these individuals as having a distinct ASD subtype, but clinical data 
      are limited. METHODS: We report five autistic probands identified by microarray 
      analysis with copy number variation (CNV) of 16p11.2 (three deletions, two 
      duplications). Each patient was assessed for ASD and dysmorphic features. We also 
      describe a deletion positive 26-month-old female who has developmental delay (DD) 
      and autistic features. RESULTS: Proband 1 (female with ASD, de novo deletion) is not 
      dysmorphic. Proband 2 (male with autism, de novo deletion) and proband 3 and his 
      brother (males with autism, inherited deletions) are dysmorphic, but the two 
      probands do not resemble one another. The mother of proband 3 has mild mental 
      retardation (MR), minor dysmorphism and meets the criteria for ASD. Proband 4 
      (dysmorphic autistic male, de novo duplication) had a congenital diaphragmatic 
      hernia. Proband 5 (non-dysmorphic ASD female with a duplication) has two apparently 
      healthy duplication positive relatives. Probands 1 and 2 have deletion negative 
      siblings with ASD and Asperger syndrome, respectively. Proband 6 (a female with DD 
      and an inherited duplication) is dysmorphic, but has oligohydramnios sequence. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The phenotypic spectrum associated with CNV at 16p11.2 includes ASD, 
      MR/DD and/or possibly other primary psychiatric disorders. Compared with the 
      microduplications, the reciprocal microdeletions are more likely to be penetrant and 
      to be associated with non-specific major or minor dysmorphism. There are deletion 
      positive ASD probands with a less severe phenotype than deletion negative ASD 
      siblings underscoring the significant phenotypic heterogeneity.

TI  - Rab proteins and Rab-associated proteins: major actors in the mechanism of 
      protein-trafficking disorders.
PG  - 723-9
LID - 10.1007/s00431-008-0740-z [doi]
AB  - Ras-associated binding (Rab) proteins and Rab-associated proteins are key regulators 
      of vesicle transport, which is essential for the delivery of proteins to specific 
      intracellular locations. More than 60 human Rab proteins have been identified, and 
      their function has been shown to depend on their interaction with different 
      Rab-associated proteins regulating Rab activation, post-translational modification 
      and intracellular localization. The number of known inherited disorders of vesicle 
      trafficking due to Rab cycle defects has increased substantially during the past 
      decade. This review describes the important role played by Rab proteins in a number 
      of rare monogenic diseases as well as common multifactorial human ones. Although the 
      clinical phenotype in these monogenic inherited diseases is highly variable and 
      dependent on the type of tissue in which the defective Rab or its associated protein 
      is expressed, frequent features are hypopigmentation (Griscelli syndrome), eye 
      defects (Choroideremia, Warburg Micro syndrome and Martsolf syndrome), disturbed 
      immune function (Griscelli syndrome and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease) and 
      neurological dysfunction (X-linked non-specific mental retardation, 
      Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, Warburg Micro syndrome and Martsolf syndrome). There is 
      also evidence that alterations in Rab function play an important role in the 
      progression of multifactorial human diseases, such as infectious diseases and type 2 
      diabetes. Rab proteins must not only be bound to GTP, but they need also to be 
      'prenylated'-i.e. bound to the cell membranes by isoprenes, which are intermediaries 
      in the synthesis of cholesterol (e.g. geranyl geranyl or farnesyl compounds). This 
      means that isoprenylation can be influenced by drugs such as statins, which inhibit 
      isoprenylation, or biphosphonates, which inhibit that farnesyl pyrophosphate 
      synthase necessary for Rab GTPase activity. CONCLUSION: Although protein-trafficking 
      disorders are clinically heterogeneous and represented in almost every subspeciality 
      of pediatrics, the identification of common pathogenic mechanisms may provide a 
      better diagnosis and management of patients with still unknown Rab cycle defects and 
      stimulate the development of therapeutic agents.

PG  - e100075

LID - e100075
AB  - Several clinical studies have shown a large number of mental symptoms by 
      immunomodulatory treatment with interferon (IFN). The most frequently described 
      symptoms are depression, suicidal behaviour, manic symptoms, anxiety, psychosis and 
      delirium, associated with other non-specific symptoms such as fatigue, irritability, 
      psychomotor retardation, decreased libido, insomnia, difficulty in concentration and 
      attention. Having a history of mental disorder contraindicates the use of IFN-alpha. 
      These adverse effects that affect the mental state appear usually at the beginning 
      of the treatment (most after 3 weeks of treatment). The incidence of psychotic 
      episodes is low and the episodes usually remit when treatment is interrupted; only 
      some cases require antipsychotic treatment. We present the case of a patient 
      affected with hepatitis C who began to present self-referential delirious symptoms 
      after receiving the treatment with IFN and who was successfully treated with 
      paliperidone. This patient could be classified within the group of high-risk 
      psychiatric patients given the family history of schizophrenia and his personal 
      history of illegal drug consumption. The pharmacological actions of paliperidone are 
      similar to other high potency atypical antipsychotics. The receptor-binding profile 
      of paliperidone most closely resembles that of risperidone and ziprasidone. 
      Paliperidone differs from risperidone and most other antipsychotics by its 
      relatively low extent of enzymatic hepatic metabolism. To the best of our knowledge, 
      this is the first case described that was successfully treated with paliperidone.

TI  - Magnetic resonance imaging in neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis.
PG  - 160-6
AB  - Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis is a group of neurodegenerative disorders 
      characterized by accumulation of lipofuscin and/or ceroid within the tissues of the 
      body. These entities are manifest by visual, intellectual, and motor deterioration 
      as well as recurrent seizures. Computed tomography has been shown to demonstrate 
      changes of cerebral atrophy in more severely affected patients. Seven patients with 
      neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis were examined with both computed tomography and 
      magnetic resonance imaging, and the results were correlated with the clinical 
      severity of the disorder. Two less severely affected patients had normal results on 
      computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging studies. Varying degrees of 
      cerebral atrophy were seen in the remaining five patients with both computed 
      tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. Severity of atrophy correlated with the 
      severity of disability in these patients. Abnormal white matter was seen in the two 
      most severely affected patients only with magnetic resonance imaging. Although the 
      findings in patients with neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis were nonspecific, the 
      increased sensitivity of magnetic resonance imaging for subtle white matter 
      abnormalities over computed tomography may prove helpful in monitoring the 
      progression of this rare disorder.

TI  - Inhibition of KDM1A activity restores adult neurogenesis and improves hippocampal 
      memory in a mouse model of Kabuki syndrome.
PG  - 779-791
LID - 10.1016/j.omtm.2021.02.011 [doi]
AB  - Kabuki syndrome (KS) is a rare cause of intellectual disability primarily caused by 
      loss-of-function mutations in lysine-specific methyltransferase 2D (KMT2D), which 
      normally adds methyl marks to lysine 4 on histone 3. Previous studies have shown 
      that a mouse model of KS (Kmt2d (+/βGeo) ) demonstrates disruption of adult 
      neurogenesis and hippocampal memory. Proof-of-principle studies have shown postnatal 
      rescue of neurological dysfunction following treatments that promote chromatin 
      opening; however, these strategies are non-specific and do not directly address the 
      primary defect of histone methylation. Since lysine-specific demethylase 1A 
      (LSD1/KDM1A) normally removes the H3K4 methyl marks added by KMT2D, we hypothesized 
      that inhibition of KDM1A demethylase activity may ameliorate molecular and 
      phenotypic defects stemming from KMT2D loss. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated a 
      recently developed KDM1A inhibitor (TAK-418) in Kmt2d (+/βGeo) mice. We found that 
      orally administered TAK-418 increases the numbers of newly born doublecortin 
      (DCX)(+) cells and processes in the hippocampus in a dose-dependent manner. We also 
      observed TAK-418-dependent rescue of histone modification defects in hippocampus 
      both by western blot and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq). 
      Treatment rescues gene expression abnormalities including those of immediate early 
      genes such as FBJ osteosarcoma oncogene (Fos) and FBJ osteosarcoma oncogene homolog 
      B (Fosb). After 2 weeks of TAK-418, Kmt2d (+/βGeo) mice demonstrated normalization 
      of hippocampal memory defects. In summary, our data suggest that KDM1A inhibition is 
      a plausible treatment strategy for KS and support the hypothesis that the epigenetic 
      dysregulation secondary to KMT2D dysfunction plays a major role in the postnatal 
      neurological disease phenotype in KS.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate attachment behavior in a 
      population of infants with infantile spasms (ISs) using the Strange Situation 
      Procedure (SSP) and to explore factors associated with the infants' attachment 
      behavior. METHODS: The SSP was assessed in a population of 29 children with ISs 
      during the second year of life. In mothers, we assessed anxiety, depression, 
      maternal emotions, and perception of the temperament of the child, and 
      sociodemographic characteristics. In children, we assessed epilepsy characteristics, 
      response to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) at the time of the SSP, and the child's 
      outcome at 3 years of age, in terms of intellectual disability (ID), and autism 
      spectrum disorder (ASD). RESULTS: Insecure attachment was higher than in the general 
      population (68% versus 32%). It was associated with maternal anxiety, sadness, and 
      maternal representation of the child at 12 months but with none of the child 
      characteristics including ID, ASD, response to AEDs, or ISs etiology. SIGNIFICANCE: 
      Nonspecific dimensions were more important than disease characteristics for the 
      infants' attachment behavior. In conclusion, we propose that interventions targeting 
      mother-child interaction could prevent attachment insecurity and the developmental 
      consequences of early epilepsy.

AB  - Antenatal diagnosis of cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome: prenatal characteristics and 
      contribution of fetal facial dysmorphic signs in utero. This paper is a case study 
      and review of literature. "RASopathies" is the term coined for a group of genetic 
      diseases that share modulation inside the MAPKinase pathway. Mutations inside the 
      coding sequence of any of these genes may be responsible for the upregulation of the 
      RAS pathway, leading on the clinical level to Type 1 Neurofibromatosis (NF1), Noonan 
      syndrome (NS), Costello syndrome (CS), Multiple Lentigines, Loose Anagen Hair 
      syndrome, Cardio-Facio-Cutaneous syndrome (CFCS), and, more recently, Legius 
      syndrome. While the postnatal presentation of this group is well-known, prenatal 
      findings are less well recognized. The presence of a RASopathy during the prenatal 
      period can be suspected on account of non-specific abnormalities: polyhydramnios, 
      cystic hygroma or high nuchal translucency, macrosomia with proportionate short long 
      bones, macrocephaly, renal, lymphatic, or cardiac defects. The current case report 
      underlines the characteristic dysmorphic facial features on 3D-ultrasound 
      (hypertelorism, down-slanting palpebral fissures, a long and marked philtrum, and 
      low-set posteriorly rotated ears) that allow for a "RASopathy" to be postulated. 
      After detecting a copy number variation (CNV) absence on a CGH array, we performed a 
      RASopathy gene panel analysis, which identified a so-far unreported heterozygous de 
      novo mutation in the BRAF gene (namely NM_004333.4 : c.1396 G > C ; p.Gly466Arg). 
      Genetic counseling has, therefore, focused on the diagnosis of a RASopathy and 
      predictable phenotype of CFCS, a distinct entity characterized by an increased risk 
      of intellectual disability and early-onset feeding problems. We suggest that a more 
      detailed prenatal facial evaluation should be performed in fetuses presenting high 
      nuchal thickness, heart defects, or unusual findings, along with the absence of a 
      CNV on a CGH array. Due to the dysmorphic facial features, targeted RASopathy genes 
      are presumed to likely to be responsible for NS, CFCS, and CS.

TI  - Primrose Syndrome.
BTI - GeneReviews(®)
AB  - CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Primrose syndrome is characterized by macrocephaly, 
      hypotonia, developmental delay, intellectual disability with expressive speech 
      delay, behavioral issues, a recognizable facial phenotype, radiographic features, 
      and altered glucose metabolism. Additional features seen in adults: sparse body 
      hair, distal muscle wasting, and contractures. Characteristic craniofacial features 
      include brachycephaly, high anterior hairline, deeply set eyes, ptosis, downslanted 
      palpebral fissures, high palate with torus palatinus, broad jaw, and large ears with 
      small or absent lobes. Radiographic features include calcification of the external 
      ear cartilage, multiple Wormian bones, platybasia, bathrocephaly, slender bones with 
      exaggerated metaphyseal flaring, mild epiphyseal dysplasia, and spondylar dysplasia. 
      Additional features include hearing impairment, ocular anomalies, cryptorchidism, 
      and nonspecific findings on brain MRI. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of Primrose 
      syndrome is established in a proband with characteristic features and a heterozygous 
      pathogenic variant in ZBTB20 identified on molecular genetic testing. MANAGEMENT: 
      Treatment: Individualized educational program, speech therapy, physical therapy, and 
      occupational therapy as indicated; treatment of behavioral concerns; applied 
      behavioral analysis for autism; standard treatment for seizures, musculoskeletal 
      issues, hearing loss, and thyroid dysfunction; oral hypoglycemics or insulin as 
      needed for diabetes. Surveillance: Monitor growth and development every six months; 
      speech and developmental assessment every six months; assess for behavioral issues, 
      seizures, and musculoskeletal complications at each visit; brain stem evoked 
      response audiometry annually; annual fasting and postprandial blood glucose, 
      hemoglobin A1c, and assessment for signs and symptoms of thyroid dysfunction. 
      GENETIC COUNSELING: Primrose syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder. All 
      probands reported to date with Primrose syndrome whose parents have undergone 
      molecular genetic testing have the disorder as a result of a de novo ZBTB20 
      pathogenic variant. If a parent of the proband is known to have the ZBTB20 
      pathogenic variant identified in the proband, the risk to the sibs of inheriting the 
      variant is 50%. Once the ZBTB20 pathogenic variant has been identified in an 
      affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and 
      preimplantation genetic testing are possible.

TI  - Sepiapterin Reductase Deficiency.
BTI - GeneReviews(®)
AB  - CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: The phenotypic spectrum of sepiapterin reductase 
      deficiency (SRD), which ranges from significant motor and cognitive deficits to only 
      minimal findings, has not been completely elucidated. Clinical features in the 
      majority of affected individuals include motor and speech delay, axial hypotonia, 
      dystonia, weakness, and oculogyric crises; symptoms show diurnal fluctuation and 
      sleep benefit. Other common features include parkinsonian signs (tremor, 
      bradykinesia, masked facies, rigidity), limb hypertonia, hyperreflexia, intellectual 
      disability, psychiatric and/or behavioral abnormalities, autonomic dysfunction, and 
      sleep disturbances (hypersomnolence, difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, and 
      drowsiness). Most affected individuals have nonspecific features in infancy 
      including developmental delays and axial hypotonia; other features develop over 
      time. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of sepiapterin reductase deficiency is 
      established in a proband by detection of biallelic pathogenic variants in SPR on 
      molecular genetic testing or characteristic abnormalities of CSF neurotransmitters 
      and pterins. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: L-dopa in combination with 
      carbidopa (or another peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor) is the main therapy used 
      to correct CNS dopamine deficiency; 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), also in combination 
      with carbidopa, has shown additional clinical benefit in some. When 
      L-dopa/5HTP/carbidopa are not tolerated or sufficiently effective some individuals 
      may benefit from use of other agents such as monoamine oxidase inhibitors, serotonin 
      reuptake inhibitors, melatonin, dopamine agonists, anticholinergics, and 
      methylphenidate. These medications most consistently correct motor abnormalities; 
      however, in some individuals cognitive manifestations remain more refractory. 
      Prevention of secondary complications: Physical, occupational, and speech therapy 
      may improve or maintain motor function. Surveillance: Data are insufficient to 
      determine how frequently CSF levels of dopamine and serotonin metabolites should be 
      evaluated and whether these levels should be used to adjust medication doses. 
      Agents/circumstances to avoid: Although adverse events with specific agents have not 
      been reported in persons with SRD, the following should be avoided on a theoretic 
      basis: sulfa drugs, methotrexate, nitrous oxide, neuroleptics, and other dopamine 
      antagonists (e.g., metoclopramide). Evaluation of relatives at risk: Although no 
      data on outcomes are available, it is appropriate to use molecular genetic testing 
      for the SPR pathogenic variants identified in the proband and/or analysis of CSF 
      neurotransmitter metabolites and pterins to clarify the genetic status of apparently 
      asymptomatic older and younger sibs of an affected individual in order to identify 
      as soon as possible those who would benefit from early initiation of treatment to 
      correct CNS dopamine and serotonin deficiency. GENETIC COUNSELING: SRD is inherited 
      in an autosomal recessive manner. At conception, each sib of an affected individual 
      has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, 
      and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Carrier testing for at-risk 
      relatives and prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk are possible if the 
      SPR pathogenic variants in the family are known.

TI  - [Clinical studies of pediatric malabsorption syndromes].
PG  - 322-50
AB  - Multiple cases with various types of pediatric malabsorption syndromes were 
      evaluated. The clinical manifestations, laboratory findings, pathophysiology, and 
      histopathological descriptions of each patient were analyzed in an effort to clear 
      the pathogenesis of the malabsorption syndromes and the treatments were undertaken. 
      The cases studied, included one patient with cystic fibrosis, two with lactose 
      intolerance with lactosuria (Durand type), one with primary intestinal 
      lymphangiectasia, two with familial hypobetalipoproteinemia, one with Hartnup 
      disease, one with congenital chroride diarrhea, one with acrodermatitis 
      enteropathica, one with intestinal nodular lymphoid hyperplasia (NLH), five with 
      intractable diarrhea of early infancy and four with glycogenosis type Ia. Each case 
      description and outcome is described below: 1. A 15-year-old Japanese boy with 
      cystic fibrosis presented with severe symptoms, including pancreatic insufficiency, 
      bronchiectasis, pneumothorax and hemoptysis. His prognosis was poor. Analysis of the 
      CFTR genes of this patient revealed a homozygous large deletion from intron 16 to 
      17b. 2. In the sibling case of Durand type lactose intolerance, the 
      subjects'disaccaridase activity of the small bowel, including lactase, were within 
      normal limits. The results of per oral and per intraduodenal lactose tolerance tests 
      confirmed lactosuria in both. These observations suggested, not only an abnormal 
      gastric condition, but also duodenal and intestinal mucosal abnormal permeability of 
      lactose. 3. In the case of primary intestinal lymphangiectasia, the subject had a 
      lymphedematous right arm and hand, a grossly coarsened mucosal pattern of the upper 
      gastrointestinal tract (identified via radiologic examination) and the presence of 
      lymphangiectasia (confirmed via duodenal mucosal biopsy). The major laboratory 
      findings were hypoalbuminemia, decreased immunoglobulin levels and lymphopenia 
      resulting from loss of lymph fluid and protein into the gastro-intestinal tract. 4. 
      In two cases of heterozygous familial hypobetalipoproteinemia, serum total 
      cholesterol and betalipoprotein levels were very low. The subjects presented with 
      symptoms and signs of acanthocytosis and fat malabsorption. Further, one subject had 
      neurological abnormalities such as mental retardation and severe convulsions. 
      Treatment with MCT formula diet corrected the lipid malabsorption. 5. A 5-year-old 
      girl presented with pellagra-like rashes, mental retardation and cerebellar ataxia. 
      An oral tryptophan (Trp) and dipeptide (Trp-Phe) loading test were conducted and the 
      renal clearance of amino acids was also evaluated in this patient and in controls. 
      Following the oral Trp loading test, plasma levels of Trp indicated a lower peak in 
      the case, reaching a maximum at 60 minutes. On the other hand, the oral dipeptide 
      (Trp-Phe) loading test in the Hartnup patient showed the peak Trp plasma level was 
      the same as the control subjects. The renal clearance of neutral amino acids in this 
      case increased to levels 5 to 35 times normal. 6. In the case of congenital chloride 
      diarrhea, the subject had secondary lactose intolerance, dehydration, hyponatremia, 
      hypokalemia, hypochloremia, hyperreninemia and metabolic alkalosis. The chloride 
      content of her fecal fluid was very high. The concentrations were 89-103 mEq/l. In 
      contrast, her urine was chloride-free. The subject's growth and development improved 
      after treatment with lactose free formura and oral replacement of the fecal loses of 
      water, NaCl and KCl. Unfortunately, the patient died of a small bowel 
      intussusception. The kidney histopathological finding was juxtaglomerular 
      hyperplasia by a necropsy. 7. In the case of acrodermatitis enteropathica, the 
      subject had characteristic skin lesions, low serum zinc levels and ALPase activity. 
      An oral ZnSO4 loading test and intestinal mucosal histology by a peroral biopsy were 
      conducted. The serum zinc peak level was 2 hours after the oral ZnSO4 loading test. 
      Infant formula alone could not maintain normal serum zinc ranges. Light microscopic 
      studies of the intestinal villous architecture showed a normal pattern. However, 
      ultrastructual examination of several epithelial cells revealed numerous 
      intracellular vesicles. After zinc therapy, these changes were decreased. The 
      lesions were postulated as the secondary result of zinc deficiency. 8. A 12-year-old 
      girl presented with hypogammaglobulinemia, recurrent infections, chronic diarrhea 
      and intestinal NLH. A barium meal and follow-through examination showed multiple 
      nodules throughout the stomach and intestine. The nodules, all uniform in size, were 
      2 mm diameter. The barium enema did not show NLH in the colon. Mucosal biopsy of the 
      stomach and jejunum revealed the typical histology of NLH in the lamina propria. 
      Also, achlorhydria was present in this patient and her serum gastrin levels were 
      very high; 315-775 pg/ml. 9. In 4 cases of intractable diarrhea in early infancy (by 
      Avery G B), a jejunal biopsy showed shortening villi and nonspecific enterocolitis. 
      Some patients were found with only low lactase or low lactase and sucrase levels. An 
      electron microscope analysis of the small bowel in 2 cases showed alterations: 
      increased pinocytosis in microvillus membranes and lysosomes by endocytosis of 
      undigested macromolecular substances. I postulated that the stated evidence was 
      causative of this clinical profile. 10. I frequently observed diarrhea as a clinical 
      manifestation in glycogenosis type Ia and lipid malabsorption in one case. The light 
      and electron photomicrographs showed intestinal absorption cells with the glycogen 
      deposits in the inferior devision of nuclei.

TI  - Prenatal diagnosis of cri-du-chat syndrome by SNP array: report of twelve cases and 
      review of the literature.
PG  - 49

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cri-du-chat syndrome (CdCS; OMIM#123450) is a classic contiguous gene 
      syndrome caused by chromosome 5p terminal deletion (5p-), which characterized by a 
      high-pitched cat-like cry, developmental delay, severe psychomotor, mental 
      retardation, and dysmorphic features in infancy. Prenatal diagnosis of CdCS is 
      difficult due to the non-specific ultrasound features. And reports using array 
      analysis are rare. This study presented the first retrospective analysis of prenatal 
      series of CdCS fetuses diagnosed by single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array in 
      China. CASE PRESENTATION: A total of 35,233 pregnant women were enrolled from Jan 
      2014 to April 2019 in our center, there are twelve 5p- cases with abnormal 
      sonographic signs revealed by SNP array, giving an incidence of 0.034% (12/35,233). 
      Clinical information and molecular basis included: maternal demographics, 
      indications for invasive testing, sonographic findings and SNP array results. Among 
      all the 5p- cases revealed, nine cases were diagnosed by both karyotyping and SNP 
      array, three cases were detected only by SNP array. Half of our cases (6/12) had an 
      isolated 5p terminal deletion, which sizes ranged from 9.0 Mb to 30 Mb. The other 
      half of cases (6/12) characterized by unbalanced translocation, with sex ratio 7:5 
      (female: male), when combine the clinical features observed from this study and 
      available literature, the most frequent anomaly observed in prenatal ultrasound 
      examination of CdCS was cerebral abnormalities, accounted for 44.4% (16/36) of the 
      existing cases. Features that are less consistent included: choroid plexus cyst 
      (13.8%, 5/36), single umbilical artery (13.3%, 4/30), ventricular septal defect 
      (11.1%, 4/36), hydrops fetalis (8.3%, 3/36), ascites (8.3%, 3/36), increased NT/NF 
      (8.3%, 3/36), absent/severely hypoplastic nasal bone (5.5%, 2/36), in order. 
      CONCLUSION: Prenatal findings such as cerebral abnormalities, absent/hypoplastic 
      nasal bone, hydrops fetalis, ascites or encephalocele may act as suggestive signs of 
      CdCS or other microdeletion/duplication syndromes. Combining typical karyotyping 
      with chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) is a definitive method for a precise 
      diagnosis of CdCS and provides more accurate results in order to offer genetic 
      counseling to families which need to deal with cryptic aberrations.

      and literature review.
PG  - 67-71
AB  - As part of an ongoing study aiming to define the clinical spectrum of 
      neuroborreliosis in childhood, we have identified four patients with unusual 
      clinical manifestations. Two patients suffered from a primarily chronic form of 
      neuroborreliosis and displayed only non-specific symptoms. An 11 year old boy 
      presented with long standing symptoms of severe weight loss and chronic headache, 
      while the other patient had pre-existing mental and motor retardation and developed 
      seizures and failure to thrive. Two further children who presented with acute 
      hemiparesis as a result of cerebral ischaemic infarction had a cerebrovascular 
      course of neuroborreliosis. One was a 15 year old girl; the other, a 5 year old boy, 
      is to our knowledge the youngest patient described with this course of illness. 
      Following adequate antibiotic treatment, all patients showed substantial improvement 
      of their respective symptoms. Laboratory and magnetic resonance imaging findings as 
      well as clinical course are discussed and the relevant literature is reviewed.

TI  - Preliminary phenotypic map of chromosome 4p16 based on 4p deletions.
PG  - 581-6
AB  - We have collected and analyzed clinical information from 11 patients with chromosome 
      4p deletions or rearrangements characterized by various molecular techniques. 
      Comparing the extent of these patients' deletions with their respective clinical 
      presentations led to the proposal of a preliminary phenotypic map of chromosome 4p. 
      This map consists of regions which, when deleted, are associated with specific 
      clinical manifestations. Nonspecific changes such as mental and growth retardation 
      are not localized, and probably result from the deletion of more than one gene or 
      region. The region associated with most of the facial traits considered typical in 
      Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome (WHS) patients coincides with the currently proposed WHS 
      critical region (WHSCR), but some anomalies commonly seen in WHS appear to map 
      outside of the WHSCR. The observation of clinodactyly in 2 patients with 
      nonoverlapping deletions allows assignment of these defects to at least 2 separate 
      regions in 4p16. These initial observations and attempts at genotype/phenotype 
      correlation lay the groundwork for identifying the genetic basis of these 
      malformations, a common objective of gene mapping efforts and chromosome deletion 
      studies.

TI  - Re-analysis of whole-exome sequencing data reveals a novel splicing variant in the 
      SLC2A1 in a patient with GLUT1 Deficiency Syndrome 1 accompanied by hemangioma: a 
      case report.
PG  - 197
LID - 10.1186/s12920-021-01045-3 [doi]
LID - 197
AB  - BACKGROUND: GLUT1 Deficiency Syndrome 1 (GLUT1DS1) is a neurological disorder caused 
      by either heterozygous or homozygous mutations in the Solute Carrier Family 2, 
      Member 1 (SLC2A1) gene. SLC2A1 encodes Glucose transporter type 1 (GLUT1) protein, 
      which is the primary glucose transporter at the blood-brain barrier. A ketogenic 
      diet (KD) provides an alternative fuel for brain metabolism to treat impaired 
      glucose transport. By reanalyzing exome data, we identified a de novo heterozygous 
      SLC2A1 variant in a girl with epilepsy. After reversed phenotyping with 
      neurometabolic tests, she was diagnosed with GLUT1DS1 and started on a KD. The 
      patient's symptoms responded to the diet. Here, we report a patient with GLUT1DS1 
      with a novel SLC2A1 mutation. She also has a hemangioma which has not been reported 
      in association with this syndrome before. CASE PRESENTATION: A 5-year 8-month girl 
      with global developmental delay, spasticity, intellectual disability, dysarthric 
      speech, abnormal eye movements, and hemangioma. The electroencephalography (EEG) 
      result revealed that she had epilepsy. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed that 
      non-specific white matter abnormalities. Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) was previously 
      performed, but the case remained unsolved. The re-analysis of WES data revealed a 
      heterozygous splicing variant in the SLC2A1 gene. Segregation analysis with parental 
      DNA samples indicated that the variant occurred de novo. Lumbar puncture (LP) 
      confirmed the diagnosis, and the patient started on a KD. Her seizures responded to 
      the KD. She has been seizure-free since shortly after the initiation of the diet. 
      She also had decreased involuntary movements, her speech became more understandable, 
      and her vocabulary increased after the diet. CONCLUSIONS: We identified a novel de 
      novo variant in the SLC2A1 gene in a patient who previously had a negative WES 
      result. The patient has been diagnosed with GLUT1DS1. The syndrome is a treatable 
      condition, but the differential diagnosis is not an easy process due to showing a 
      wide range of phenotypic spectrum and the overlapping symptoms with other 
      neurological diseases. The diagnosis necessitates a genomic testing approach. Our 
      findings also highlight the importance of re-analysis to undiagnosed cases after 
      initial WES to reveal disease-causing variants.

TI  - Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification for genetic screening in autism 
      spectrum disorders: efficient identification of known microduplications and 
      identification of a novel microduplication in ASMT.
PG  - 50
LID - 10.1186/1755-8794-1-50 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: It has previously been shown that specific microdeletions and 
      microduplications, many of which also associated with cognitive impairment (CI), can 
      present with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Multiplex ligation-dependent probe 
      amplification (MLPA) represents an efficient method to screen for such recurrent 
      microdeletions and microduplications. METHODS: In the current study, a total of 279 
      unrelated subjects ascertained for ASDs were screened for genomic disorders 
      associated with CI using MLPA. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), 
      quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) and/or direct DNA sequencing were 
      used to validate potential microdeletions and microduplications. 
      Methylation-sensitive MLPA was used to characterize individuals with duplications in 
      the Prader-Willi/Angelman (PWA) region. RESULTS: MLPA showed two subjects with 
      typical ASD-associated interstitial duplications of the 15q11-q13 PWA region of 
      maternal origin. Two additional subjects showed smaller, de novo duplications of the 
      PWA region that had not been previously characterized. Genes in these two novel 
      duplications include GABRB3 and ATP10A in one case, and MKRN3, MAGEL2 and NDN in the 
      other. In addition, two subjects showed duplications of the 22q11/DiGeorge syndrome 
      region. One individual was found to carry a 12 kb deletion in one copy of the ASPA 
      gene on 17p13, which when mutated in both alleles leads to Canavan disease. Two 
      subjects showed partial duplication of the TM4SF2 gene on Xp11.4, previously 
      implicated in X-linked non-specific mental retardation, but in our subsequent 
      analyses such variants were also found in controls. A partial duplication in the 
      ASMT gene, located in the pseudoautosomal region 1 (PAR1) of the sex chromosomes and 
      previously suggested to be involved in ASD susceptibility, was observed in 6-7% of 
      the cases but in only 2% of controls (P = 0.003). CONCLUSION: MLPA proves to be an 
      efficient method to screen for chromosomal abnormalities. We identified duplications 
      in 15q11-q13 and in 22q11, including new de novo small duplications, as likely 
      contributing to ASD in the current sample by increasing liability and/or 
      exacerbating symptoms. Our data indicate that duplications in TM4SF2 are not 
      associated with the phenotype given their presence in controls. The results in 
      PAR1/PAR2 are the first large-scale studies of gene dosage in these regions, and the 
      findings at the ASMT locus indicate that further studies of the duplication of the 
      ASMT gene are needed in order to gain insight into its potential involvement in ASD. 
      Our studies also identify some limitations of MLPA, where single base changes in 
      probe binding sequences alter results. In summary, our studies indicate that MLPA, 
      with a focus on accepted medical genetic conditions, may be an inexpensive method 
      for detection of microdeletions and microduplications in ASD patients for purposes 
      of genetic counselling if MLPA-identified deletions are validated by additional 
      methods.

TI  - Prenatal malnutrition alters diazepam-mediated suppression of ultrasonic 
      vocalizations in an age dependent manner.
PG  - 337-43
AB  - The sensitivity of prenatally malnourished rats to the ultrasonic vocalization (USV) 
      suppressant effect of diazepam (a non-specific benzodiazepine (BZ) receptor agonist) 
      was investigated. Male offspring of dams provided with a protein deficient diet (6% 
      casein) for 5 weeks prior to mating and throughout pregnancy were compared to the 
      offspring of mothers provided with a diet of adequate protein content (25% casein). 
      At postnatal day 7 or 11, pups were injected with vehicle or one of five doses of DZ 
      (0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1 or 3mg/kg) 30 min after removal from their dam. Thirty minutes 
      later they were subjected to 2 min of cooling on a 20 degrees C surface and their 
      USVs were quantified. DZ dose-dependently suppressed USV at both ages. At P7, the 
      USV suppressant effect of DZ was the same for both groups. However, by P11 the 
      prenatally malnourished rats showed significantly greater suppression of USV by 0.03 
      and 0.1mg/kg DZ than well-nourished controls. These differences were not related to 
      degree of temperature loss or body weight. Thus, differential sensitivity to BZ 
      receptor agonists develops in the second postnatal week in prenatally malnourished 
      rats. This reflects either an altered program of development of the GABAergic 
      system, or adaptive, compensatory changes in the GABAergic system in response to 
      more extensive functional disturbances in the developing brain.

TI  - Targeted next-generation sequencing identifies the disruption of the SHANK3 and RYR2 
      genes in a patient carrying a de novo t(1;22)(q43;q13.3) associated with signs of 
      Phelan-McDermid syndrome.

AB  - BACKGROUND: It has been known for more than 30 years that balanced translocations, 
      especially if de novo, can associate with congenital malformations and / or 
      neurodevelopmental disorders, following the disruption of a disease gene or its 
      cis-regulatory elements at one or both breakpoints. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe a 
      10-year-old girl with a non-specific neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by 
      moderate intellectual disability (ID), gross motor clumsiness, social and 
      communication deficits. She carries a de novo reciprocal translocation between 
      chromosomes 1q43 and 22q13.3, the latter suggesting the involvement of SHANK3. 
      Indeed, its haploinsufficiency associates with Phelan-McDermid Syndrome, whose main 
      symptoms are characterized by global developmental delay and absent or severely 
      delayed expressive speech. A deep molecular approach, including next-generation 
      sequencing of SHANK3 locus, allowed demonstrating the breakage of RYR2 and SHANK3 on 
      the derivative chromosomes 1 and 22 respectively, and the formation of two fusion 
      genes SHANK3-RYR2 and RYR2-SHANK3 with concomitant cryptic deletion of 3.6 and 4.1 
      kilobases at translocation junction of both derivatives chromosomes 22 and 1, 
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Although the interruption of SHANK3 accounts for the 
      patient's psychomotor retardation and autism-like behavior, we do not exclude that 
      the interruption of RYR2 may also have a role on her disorder, or result in further 
      pathogenicity in the future. Indeed, RYR2 that has a well-established role in the 
      etiology of two autosomal dominant adulthood cardiac disorders (#600996 and #604772) 
      is also expressed in the brain (cerebellum, hippocampus, and cerebral cortex) and 
      about half of RYR2 mutation carriers present late onset primary generalized epilepsy 
      without cardiac arrhythmogenic disorders. Moreover, RYR2 variants have also been 
      sporadically reported in individuals with early onset schizophrenia or ID, and its 
      constraint values suggest intolerance to loss-of-function. This study not only 
      confirms the usefulness of the molecular mapping of de novo balanced rearrangements 
      in symptomatic individuals, but also underscores the need for long-term clinical 
      evaluation of the patients, for better evaluating the pathogenicity of the 
      chromosomal breakpoints.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Individuals with Down syndrome (DS) show enhanced amyloid beta (Aβ) 
      deposition in the brain. A new positron emission tomography (PET) index of amyloid 
      load (Aβ(L) ) was recently developed as an alternative to standardized uptake value 
      ratios (SUVrs) to quantify Aβ burden with high sensitivity for detecting and 
      tracking Aβ change.(1). METHODS: Aβ(L) was calculated in a DS cohort (N = 169, mean 
      age ± SD = 39.6 ± 8.7 years) using [C-11]Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) PET imaging. 
      DS-specific PiB templates were created for Aβ carrying capacity (K) and non-specific 
      binding (NS). RESULTS: The highest values of Aβ carrying capacity were found in the 
      striatum and precuneus. Longitudinal changes in Aβ(L) displayed less variability 
      when compared to SUVrs. DISCUSSION: These results highlight the utility of Aβ(L) for 
      characterizing Aβ deposition in DS. Rates of Aβ accumulation in DS were found to be 
      similar to that observed in late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD; ≈3% to 4% per year), 
      suggesting that AD progression in DS is of earlier onset but not accelerated.

TI  - Phenotypic characterization of individuals with SYNGAP1 pathogenic variants reveals 
      a potential correlation between posterior dominant rhythm and developmental 
      progression.
PG  - 18

LID - 18
AB  - BACKGROUND: The SYNGAP1 gene encodes for a small GTPase-regulating protein critical 
      to dendritic spine maturation and synaptic plasticity. Mutations have recently been 
      identified to cause a breadth of neurodevelopmental disorders including autism, 
      intellectual disability, and epilepsy. The purpose of this work is to define the 
      phenotypic spectrum of SYNGAP1 gene mutations and identify potential biomarkers of 
      clinical severity and developmental progression. METHODS: A retrospective clinical 
      data analysis of individuals with SYNGAP1 mutations was conducted. Data included 
      genetic diagnosis, clinical history and examinations, neurophysiologic data, 
      neuroimaging, and serial neurodevelopmental/behavioral assessments. All patients 
      were seen longitudinally within a 6-year period; data analysis was completed on June 
      30, 2018. Records for all individuals diagnosed with deleterious SYNGAP1 variants 
      (by clinical sequencing or exome sequencing panels) were reviewed. RESULTS: Fifteen 
      individuals (53% male) with seventeen unique SYNGAP1 mutations are reported. Mean 
      age at genetic diagnosis was 65.9 months (28-174 months). All individuals had 
      epilepsy, with atypical absence seizures being the most common semiology (60%). EEG 
      abnormalities included intermittent rhythmic delta activity (60%), slow or absent 
      posterior dominant rhythm (87%), and epileptiform activity (93%), with generalized 
      discharges being more common than focal. Neuroimaging revealed nonspecific 
      abnormalities (53%). Neurodevelopmental evaluation revealed impairment in all 
      individuals, with gross motor function being the least affected. Autism spectrum 
      disorder was diagnosed in 73% and aggression in 60% of cases. Analysis of biomarkers 
      revealed a trend toward a moderate positive correlation between 
      visual-perceptual/fine motor/adaptive skills and language development, with 
      posterior dominant rhythm on electroencephalogram (EEG), independent of age. No 
      other neurophysiology-development associations or correlations were identified. 
      CONCLUSIONS: A broad spectrum of neurologic and neurodevelopmental features are 
      found with pathogenic variants of SYNGAP1. An abnormal posterior dominant rhythm on 
      EEG correlated with abnormal developmental progression, providing a possible 
      prognostic biomarker.

      features: 22q13 deletion syndrome (Phelan-McDermid Syndrome) as an important 
      differential diagnosis].
PG  - 318-20
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clarifying the cause of global developmental and speech delay is of 
      considerable significance in pediatrics. We present the clinical phenotype of the 
      22q13 deletion syndrome - also known as Phelan-McDermid syndrome - and show the 
      diagnostic options. PATIENT: We report on a female patient with muscular hypotonia, 
      tall stature, minor facial dysmorphism, retarded motor and mental development, and 
      severe speech delay. METHOD: Chromosomal analysis was performed first on peripheral 
      lymphocytes on GTG-banded chromosomes. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) 
      analysis was carried out using the dual-color LSI DiGeorge/VCFS Region Probe 
      (TUPLE1, N25) (Vysis/Abbott) and the subtelomeric probe tel 22q13.3 (Tel Vysion 
      22q). RESULTS: The analysis of metaphase chromosomes at 450 band resolution showed a 
      normal female karyotype 46,XX. FISH analysis revealed a 22q13 deletion. CONCLUSION: 
      Muscular hypotonia and developmental delay are non-specific findings observed in 
      many genetic syndromes. In association with severe speech delay and normal or 
      advanced growth pediatricians should consider 22q13 deletion syndrome as a potential 
      cause and initiate a genetic examination.

TI  - Clinical, biochemical, and molecular analysis of combined methylmalonic acidemia and

AB  - The most common inborn error of cobalamin (cbl) metabolism in China is the cblC type 
      characterized by combined methylmalonic acidemia and hyperhomocysteinemia. The 
      clinical presentation is relatively nonspecific, such as feeding difficulty, 
      recurrent vomiting, hypotonia, lethargy, seizures, progressive developmental delay, 
      and mental retardation, together with anemia and metabolic acidosis. More specific 
      biochemical findings include high levels of propionylcarnitine (C3), free carnitine 
      (C3/C0), and acetylcarnitine (C3/C2) measured by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), 
      elevation of methylmalonic acid (MMA) measured by gas chromatography-mass 
      spectrometry (GC-MS), and increased total homocysteine with normal or decreased 
      methionine. We report on 50 Chinese patients with combined methylmalonic acidemia 
      and hyperhomocysteinemia. Forty-six belonged to the cblC complementation group. 
      Mutation analysis of the MMACHC gene was performed to characterize the mutational 
      spectrum of cblC deficiency, and 17 different mutations were found. Most were 
      clustered in exons 3 and 4, accounting for 91.3% of all mutant alleles. Two 
      mutations were novel, namely, c.315 C>G (p.Y105X) and c.470 G>C(p.W157S). In terms 
      of genotype-phenotype correlation, the c.609 G>A mutation was associated with 
      early-onset disease when homozygous. Unlike previous reports from other populations, 
      c.609 G>A (p.W203X) was the most frequent cblC mutation detected in our study of 
      Chinese patients, affecting 51 of 92 MMACHC alleles (55.4%). The high prevalence of 
      this nonsense mutation could have potential therapeutic significance for Chinese 
      cblC patients. Besides traditional approaches consisting of hydroxocobalamin 
      injections, carnitine, betaine, and protein restriction, novel drugs that target 
      premature termination codons may have a role in the future.

TI  - Clinical and neurological findings of severe vitamin B12 deficiency in infancy and 
      importance of early diagnosis and treatment.
PG  - 820-4
LID - 10.1111/jpc.12292 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Nutritional vitamin B12 deficiency among children in developing countries may 
      lead to a severe clinical status. In this article, the clinical manifestations of 
      vitamin B12 deficiency and the consequences of delay in its diagnosis have been 
      evaluated. METHODS: A total of 41 patients who were hospitalised and treated with 
      the diagnosis of severe vitamin B12 deficiency in the paediatric haematology 
      department of the hospital were enrolled in the trial. The diagnosis of severe 
      vitamin B12 deficiency was based on haematological values, a serum vitamin B12 level 
      of <100 pg/mL and a normal level of folic acid. Mental, neuro-motor and social 
      developments of the enrolled patients were assessed by the same physician using the 
      Ankara Developmental Screening Inventory. RESULTS: The mean age of 25 male and 16 
      female patients was determined as 12 (6-18 months) months. Almost all of the 
      children had been fed with breast milk and a poor nutritional state was found in all 
      of the mothers. Non-specific findings such as growth retardation (78%), 
      hyperpigmentation of the skin (78%), diarrhoea (63.4%), convulsion (14.6%), 
      weakness, reluctance to eat, vomiting, irritability and tremor were found in all the 
      patients, in addition to hypotonia, motor retardation and pallor. Treatment with 
      vitamin B12 provided recovery in all the patients. The mean age of the patients with 
      full recovery was 11.7 months, while the mean age of patients with partial recovery 
      was 12.9 months. CONCLUSION: As a delay in the diagnosis causes irreversible 
      neurological damage, early diagnosis and treatment is highly important.

TI  - Cytogenetic and Array-CGH Characterization of a Simple Case of Reciprocal t(3;10) 
      Translocation Reveals a Hidden Deletion at 5q12.
LID - 10.3390/genes12060877 [doi]
LID - 877
AB  - Chromosome deletions, including band 5q12, have rarely been reported and have been 
      associated with a wide range of clinical manifestations, such as postnatal growth 
      retardation, intellectual disability, hyperactivity, nonspecific ocular defects, 
      facial dysmorphism, and epilepsy. In this study, we describe for the first time a 
      child with growth retardation in which we identified a balanced t(3;10) 
      translocation by conventional cytogenetic analysis in addition to an 8.6 Mb 5q12 
      deletion through array-CGH. Our results show that the phenotypic abnormalities of a 
      case that had been interpreted as "balanced" by conventional cytogenetics are mainly 
      due to a cryptic deletion, highlighting the need for molecular investigation in 
      subjects with an abnormal phenotype before assuming the cause is an apparently 
      simple cytogenetic rearrangement. Finally, we identify PDE4D and PIK3R1 genes as the 
      two major candidates responsible for the clinical features expressed in our patient.

TI  - A novel homozygous variant in TRAPPC2L results in a neurodevelopmental disorder and 
      disrupts TRAPP complex function.
PG  - 592-601
LID - 10.1136/jmedgenet-2020-107016 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Next-generation sequencing has facilitated the diagnosis of 
      neurodevelopmental disorders with variable and non-specific clinical findings. 
      Recently, a homozygous missense p.(Asp37Tyr) variant in TRAPPC2L, a core subunit of 
      TRAPP complexes which function as tethering factors during membrane trafficking, was 
      reported in two unrelated individuals with neurodevelopmental delay, post-infectious 
      encephalopathy-associated developmental arrest, tetraplegia and accompanying 
      rhabdomyolysis. METHODS: We performed whole genome sequencing on members of an 
      Ashkenazi Jewish pedigree to identify the underlying genetic aetiology of global 
      developmental delay/intellectual disability in three affected siblings. To assess 
      the effect of the identified TRAPPC2L variant, we performed biochemical and cell 
      biological functional studies on the TRAPPC2L protein. RESULTS: A rare homozygous 
      predicted deleterious missense variant, p.(Ala2Gly), in TRAPPC2L was identified in 
      the affected siblings and it segregated with the neurodevelopmental phenotype within 
      the family. Using a yeast two-hybrid assay and in vitro binding, we demonstrate that 
      the p.(Ala2Gly) variant, but not the p.(Asp37Tyr) variant, disrupted the interaction 
      between TRAPPC2L and another core TRAPP protein, TRAPPC6a. Size exclusion 
      chromatography suggested that this variant affects the assembly of TRAPP complexes. 
      Employing two different membrane trafficking assays using fibroblasts from one of 
      the affected siblings, we found a delay in traffic into and out of the Golgi. 
      Similar to the p.(Asp37Tyr) variant, the p.(Ala2Gly) variant resulted in an increase 
      in the levels of active RAB11. CONCLUSION: Our data fill in a gap in the knowledge 
      of TRAPP architecture with TRAPPC2L interacting with TRAPPC6a, positioning it as a 
      putative adaptor for other TRAPP subunits. Collectively, our findings support the 
      pathogenicity of the TRAPPC2L p.(Ala2Gly) variant.

TI  - Plasma amino acids indicate glioblastoma with ATRX loss.
PG  - 119-132
LID - 10.1007/s00726-020-02931-3 [doi]
AB  - Glioblastoma (GB) is the most common primary brain tumour in adults. The lack of 
      molecular biomarker, non-specific symptoms and fast growth rate often result in 
      a significant delay in diagnosis. Despite multimodal treatment, the prognosis 
      remains poor. Here, we verified the hypothesis that amino acids (AA) regulating the 
      critical metabolic pathways necessary for maintenance, growth, reproduction, and 
      immunity of an organism, may constitute a favourable target in GB biomarker 
      research. We measured the plasma amino acids levels in 18 GB patients and 15 
      controls and performed the quantitative and qualitative metabolomic analysis of free 
      AA applying high-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass 
      spectrometry (LC-QTOF-MS). We present both the raw data and the results of our 
      statistical analysis. The majority of AA were lowered in the study group in 
      comparison to the control group. Five of these (arginine, glutamic acid, glutamine, 
      glycine, and histidine) differed significantly (all p < 10(-5) and AUC > 0.9). 
      Plasma levels of leucine and phenylalanine decreased in the case of GB with lost 
      alpha-thalassemia/mental retardation X-linked (ATRX) expression on 
      immunohistochemistry (p = 0.003 and 0.045, respectively). We demonstrated for the 
      first time that certain plasma-free AA levels of GB patients were significantly 
      different from those in healthy volunteers. Target profiling of plasma-free AA, 
      identified utilizing LC-QTOF-MS, may present prognostic value by indicating GB 
      patients with lost ATRX expression. The on-going quest for glioma biomarkers still 
      aims to determine the detailed metabolic profile and evaluate its impact on therapy 
      and prognosis.

TI  - Truncating SRCAP variants outside the Floating-Harbor syndrome locus cause a 
      distinct neurodevelopmental disorder with a specific DNA methylation signature.

AB  - Truncating variants in exons 33 and 34 of the SNF2-related CREBBP activator protein 
      (SRCAP) gene cause the neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD) Floating-Harbor syndrome 
      (FLHS), characterized by short stature, speech delay, and facial dysmorphism. Here, 
      we present a cohort of 33 individuals with clinical features distinct from FLHS and 
      truncating (mostly de novo) SRCAP variants either proximal (n = 28) or distal (n = 
      5) to the FLHS locus. Detailed clinical characterization of the proximal SRCAP 
      individuals identified shared characteristics: developmental delay with or without 
      intellectual disability, behavioral and psychiatric problems, non-specific facial 
      features, musculoskeletal issues, and hypotonia. Because FLHS is known to be 
      associated with a unique set of DNA methylation (DNAm) changes in blood, a DNAm 
      signature, we investigated whether there was a distinct signature associated with 
      our affected individuals. A machine-learning model, based on the FLHS DNAm 
      signature, negatively classified all our tested subjects. Comparing proximal 
      variants with typically developing controls, we identified a DNAm signature distinct 
      from the FLHS signature. Based on the DNAm and clinical data, we refer to the 
      condition as "non-FLHS SRCAP-related NDD." All five distal variants classified 
      negatively using the FLHS DNAm model while two classified positively using the 
      proximal model. This suggests divergent pathogenicity of these variants, though 
      clinically the distal group presented with NDD, similar to the proximal SRCAP group. 
      In summary, for SRCAP, there is a clear relationship between variant location, DNAm 
      profile, and clinical phenotype. These results highlight the power of combined 
      epigenetic, molecular, and clinical studies to identify and characterize 
      genotype-epigenotype-phenotype correlations.

TI  - Mucopolysaccharidosis Type I.
BTI - GeneReviews(®)
AB  - CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) is a progressive 
      multisystem disorder with features ranging over a continuum of severity. While 
      affected individuals have traditionally been classified as having one of three MPS I 
      syndromes (Hurler syndrome, Hurler-Scheie syndrome, or Scheie syndrome), no easily 
      measurable biochemical differences have been identified and the clinical findings 
      overlap. Affected individuals are best described as having either a phenotype 
      consistent with either severe (Hurler syndrome) or attenuated MPS I, a distinction 
      that influences therapeutic options. Severe MPS I. Infants appear normal at birth. 
      Typical early manifestations are nonspecific (e.g., umbilical or inguinal hernia, 
      frequent upper respiratory tract infections before age 1 year). Coarsening of the 
      facial features may not become apparent until after age one year. Gibbus deformity 
      of the lower spine is common and often noted within the first year. Progressive 
      skeletal dysplasia (dysostosis multiplex) involving all bones is universal, as is 
      progressive arthropathy involving most joints. By age three years, linear growth 
      decreases. Intellectual disability is progressive and profound but may not be 
      readily apparent in the first year of life. Progressive cardiorespiratory 
      involvement, hearing loss, and corneal clouding are common. Without treatment, death 
      (typically from cardiorespiratory failure) usually occurs within the first ten years 
      of life. Attenuated MPS I. Clinical onset is usually between ages three and ten 
      years. The severity and rate of disease progression range from serious 
      life-threatening complications leading to death in the second to third decade, to a 
      normal life span complicated by significant disability from progressive joint 
      manifestations and cardiorespiratory disease. While some individuals have no 
      neurologic involvement and psychomotor development may be normal in early childhood, 
      learning disabilities and psychiatric manifestations can be present later in life. 
      Hearing loss, cardiac valvular disease, respiratory involvement, and corneal 
      clouding are common. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of MPS I is established in a 
      proband with suggestive clinical and laboratory findings by: detection of deficient 
      activity of the lysosomal enzyme α-L-iduronidase (IDUA) in combination with 
      elevation of glycosaminoglycan levels; and/or identification of biallelic pathogenic 
      variants in IDUA on molecular genetic testing. Identification of the causative IDUA 
      variants plays an important role in the determination of phenotype. MANAGEMENT: An 
      essential component of management is the determination of whether the proband has 
      severe or attenuated MPS I. This requires detailed clinical and laboratory 
      assessment and can be challenging in very young individuals. Treatment of 
      manifestations: Infant learning programs/special education for developmental delay; 
      physical therapy, orthopedic surgery as needed, joint replacement for progressive 
      arthropathy, atlanto-occipital stabilization; spinal cord decompression for cervical 
      myelopathy; cerebrospinal fluid shunting for hydrocephalus; early median nerve 
      decompression for carpal tunnel syndrome based on nerve conduction studies before 
      clinical manifestations develop; special attention to anesthetic risks; hats with 
      visors/sunglasses to reduce glare, corneal transplantation for ophthalmologic 
      involvement; cardiac valve replacement as needed and bacterial endocarditis 
      prophylaxis for those with cardiac involvement; tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy for 
      eustachian tube dysfunction and/or upper airway obstruction; ventilating tubes; 
      hearing aids as needed; CPAP for sleep apnea; gastrointestinal management for 
      diarrhea and constipation. Prevention of primary manifestations: Hematopoietic stem 
      cell transplantation (HSCT) for children with severe MPS I. Outcome is significantly 
      influenced by disease burden at the time of diagnosis (and thus, by the age of the 
      individual). HSCT can improve cognitive outcomes, increase survival, improve growth, 
      reduce facial coarseness and hepatosplenomegaly, improve hearing, prevent 
      hydrocephalus, and alter the natural history of cardiac and respiratory 
      symptomatology. HSCT has lesser effects on the skeletal and joint manifestations, 
      corneal clouding, and cardiac involvement. HSCT alters the course of cognitive 
      decline in children with severe MPS I; cognitive outcome is greatly influenced by 
      the degree of cognitive impairment at the time of transplantation. Due to the 
      morbidity and mortality associated with HSCT, it is currently recommended primarily 
      for children with severe MPS I. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with laronidase 
      (Aldurazyme(®)), licensed for treatment of the non-CNS manifestations of MPS I, 
      improves liver size, linear growth, and mobility and joint range of motion; slows 
      progression of respiratory disease; and improves sleep apnea in persons with 
      attenuated disease. The age of initiation of ERT influences the outcome. 
      Surveillance: Annual assessment by a team of physicians with knowledge of the 
      multisystem nature of MPS I. Specialists and assessments: orthopedic surgery 
      including annual assessment of median nerve conduction velocity; ophthalmology, 
      cardiology (including echocardiography), respiratory with assessment of pulmonary 
      function and sleep studies, audiology, and otolaryngology. Assessment for 
      constipation and/or hernias as needed. Early and continuous monitoring of head 
      growth in infants and children with imaging as needed; assessment for evidence of 
      spinal cord compression by neurologic examination; developmental assessment 
      annually; and psycho-educational assessment of children with attenuated disease 
      prior to primary school entry. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Early diagnosis 
      prior to significant disease manifestations is warranted in relatives at risk in 
      order to initiate therapy as early in the course of disease as possible. GENETIC 
      COUNSELING: MPS I is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At conception, each 
      child of a couple in which both parents are heterozygous for a IDUA pathogenic 
      variant has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic 
      carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Carrier testing for 
      at-risk relatives and prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk are 
      possible if both disease-causing IDUA variants have been identified in the family.

AB  - De novo variants represent a significant cause of neurodevelopmental delay and 
      intellectual disability. A genetic basis can be identified in only half of 
      individuals who have neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs); this indicates that 
      additional causes need to be elucidated. We compared the frequency of de novo 
      variants in patient-parent trios with (n = 2,030) versus without (n = 2,755) NDDs. 
      We identified de novo variants in TAOK1 (thousand and one [TAO] amino acid kinase 
      1), which encodes the serine/threonine-protein kinase TAO1, in three individuals 
      with NDDs but not in persons who did not have NDDs. Through further screening and 
      the use of GeneMatcher, five additional individuals with NDDs were found to have de 
      novo variants. All eight variants were absent from gnomAD (Genome Aggregation 
      Database). The variant carriers shared a non-specific phenotype of developmental 
      delay, and six individuals had additional muscular hypotonia. We established a 
      fibroblast line of one mutation carrier, and we demonstrated that reduced mRNA 
      levels of TAOK1 could be increased upon cycloheximide treatment. These results 
      indicate nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Further, there was neither detectable 
      phosphorylated TAO1 kinase nor phosphorylated tau in these cells, and mitochondrial 
      morphology was altered. Knockdown of the ortholog gene Tao1 (Tao, CG14217) in 
      Drosophila resulted in delayed early development. The majority of the Tao1-knockdown 
      flies did not survive beyond the third instar larval stage. When compared to control 
      flies, Tao1 knockdown flies revealed changed morphology of the ventral nerve cord 
      and the neuromuscular junctions as well as a decreased number of endings (boutons). 
      Furthermore, mitochondria in mutant flies showed altered distribution and decreased 
      size in axons of motor neurons. Thus, we provide compelling evidence that de novo 
      variants in TAOK1 cause NDDs.

AB  - Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in humans comprises a family of four cell-surface 
      phosphomonoester phosphohydrolase isozymes. Three genes separately encode the 
      "tissue-specific" ALPs whereas the fourth gene encodes ubiquitous homodimeric 
      "tissue-nonspecific" ALP (TNSALP) richly expressed in bone, liver, kidney, and 
      developing teeth. TNSALP monomers have five putative N-linked glycosylation sites 
      where different post-translational modifications account for this isozyme's 
      distinctive physicochemical properties in different organs. Three bone-derived 
      TNSALP (BALP) isoforms (B/I, B1, and B2) are present in healthy serum, whereas a 
      fourth BALP isoform (B1x) can circulate in chronic kidney disease. Herein, we report 
      a healthy boy with persistent hyperphosphatasemia due to BALP levels two- to 
      threefold higher than age-appropriate reference values. High-performance liquid 
      chromatography, electrophoresis, heat inactivation, catalysis inhibition, and 
      polyethylene glycol precipitation revealed increased serum B/I, B1, and B2 differing 
      from patterns found in skeletal diseases. B/I was ~23-fold elevated. Absence of 
      mental retardation and physical stigmata excluded Mabry syndrome, the ALP-anchoring 
      disorder causing hyperphosphatasemia. Routine biochemical studies indicated intact 
      mineral homeostasis. Serum N-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen (P1NP) level 
      was normal, but C-terminal cross-linking telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX) level 
      was elevated. However, radiological studies showed no evidence for a generalized 
      skeletal disturbance. Circulating pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, a TNSALP natural 
      substrate, was not low despite the laboratory hyperphosphatasemia, thereby 
      suggesting BALP phosphohydrolase activity was not elevated endogenously. Mutation 
      analysis of the ALPL gene encoding TNSALP revealed no defect. His non-consanguineous 
      healthy parents had serum total ALP activity and BALP protein levels that were 
      normal. Our patient's sporadic idiopathic hyperphosphatasemia could reflect altered 
      post-translational modification together with increased expression and/or impaired 
      degradation of BALP.

TI  - The clinical and molecular spectrum of QRICH1 associated neurodevelopmental 
      disorder.
PG  - 266-282
LID - 10.1002/humu.24308 [doi]
AB  - De novo variants in QRICH1 (Glutamine-rich protein 1) has recently been reported in 
      11 individuals with intellectual disability (ID). The function of QRICH1 is largely 
      unknown but it is likely to play a key role in the unfolded response of endoplasmic 
      reticulum stress through transcriptional control of proteostasis. In this study, we 
      present 27 additional individuals and delineate the clinical and molecular spectrum 
      of the individuals (n = 38) with QRICH1 variants. The main clinical features were 
      mild to moderate developmental delay/ID (71%), nonspecific facial dysmorphism (92%) 
      and hypotonia (39%). Additional findings included poor weight gain (29%), short 
      stature (29%), autism spectrum disorder (29%), seizures (24%) and scoliosis (18%). 
      Minor structural brain abnormalities were reported in 52% of the individuals with 
      brain imaging. Truncating or splice variants were found in 28 individuals and 10 had 
      missense variants. Four variants were inherited from mildly affected parents. This 
      study confirms that heterozygous QRICH1 variants cause a neurodevelopmental disorder 
      including short stature and expands the phenotypic spectrum to include poor weight 
      gain, scoliosis, hypotonia, minor structural brain anomalies, and seizures. 
      Inherited variants from mildly affected parents are reported for the first time, 
      suggesting variable expressivity.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Niemann-Pick type C disease (NPC) is a rare genetic disease with an 
      extremely heterogeneous clinical presentation. The adult form of this disease is 
      usually expressed with neurological symptoms; however, non-specific psychiatric 
      disorders are often associated. This article presents a retrospective study on a 
      cohort of NPC patients diagnosed in France with the objectives of researching the 
      presence of psychiatric disorders and qualifying these disorders. METHODS: After 
      carrying out a research within hospital records, a questionnaire was sent to 
      patients or their relatives and their doctors. RESULTS: The cohort was made up of 
      22 patients. Fifty-two questionnaires were sent to 47 different doctors. We received 
      67% of answers from the doctors, with 42% of positive answers. The answer rate of 
      the families was 27%. Among the 22 patients, we found the presence of psychiatric 
      disorders in 86% of cases. Seventy-three percent of the patients presented behavior 
      disorders. Among them, 27% exhibited psychomotor excitation or agitation, 23% 
      aggressiveness, 18% intolerance to frustration, 27% sleep disorders and 23% apathy, 
      listlessness and/or clinophilia. Fifty-five percent of patients presented psychotic 
      symptoms, with 45% with delusions and 36% with hallucinations. Seventy-seven percent 
      of patients presented with mood disorders: 36% suffered from depression and 27% from 
      emotional lability or mood swings. Of the 22 patients, a diagnosis of psychiatric 
      disease was made in 50% of cases. The main diagnoses were schizophrenia (27%) and 
      depression (23%). The other diagnoses identified were acute delirium, dysthymia, 
      infantile psychosis, intellectual disharmonic disability and personality disorder. 
      The average age of emergence of the troubles was 17.1 years old for neurological 
      symptoms and 20.9 years old for psychiatric symptoms. The median age was 18 years 
      old for neurological symptoms and 20 years old for psychiatric ones. In 45% of 
      cases, psychiatric occurred after neurological symptoms; in 27%, they occurred 
      before and they were concomitant in 9%. In 50% of cases, psychiatric symptoms 
      existed before the early diagnosis of NPC; in 9%, they occurred after and in 5%, 
      they occurred during the diagnostic process. Fifty-five percent of the patients were 
      followed by a psychiatrist, 50% of patients had been hospitalized at least once in a 
      psychiatric department. Fifty-five percent of the patients received neuroleptics or 
      antipsychotics, 41% received antidepressants, 41% received mood stabilizers or 
      anticonvulsants, 45% received anxiolytics and 23% hypnotics. DISCUSSION: Whilst a 
      small cohort, the low incidence of NPC (1/120,000 to 1/150,000) and the scale of a 
      single-center study make the findings important. In our cohort, we found psychiatric 
      disorders in most of the patients. The symptoms were varied and non-specific, and 
      mainly found in late-onset forms of the disease. This incidence of disorder is much 
      higher than the literature suggests, generally describing psychiatric disorders in 
      approximately one third of NPC adult form. On the other hand, our results on 
      schizophrenia are consistent with the updated recommendations for the diagnosis and 
      management of NPC. According to our results, a retrospective study to develop a 
      suspicion index to aid diagnosis of NPC suggests that psychotic symptoms are 
      underestimated in this disease. In our cohort, we also found a significant rate of 
      psychiatric hospitalizations and psychotropic drugs prescription that had not been 
      previously described in the international literature. We did not have sufficient 
      data on the effectiveness of symptomatic treatment in NPC; the literature was 
      contradictory. It should be noted that despite the high rate of psychiatric patients 
      in our cohort, only half of patients consulted a psychiatrist and a few of them have 
      regular follow-up. To conclude, our study is in line with the current literature 
      that suggests an under-estimation of psychiatric disorders in NPC, but also a likely 
      under-diagnosis of NPC in psychiatric departments. All this data encourage us to 
      keep alerting psychiatrists to identifying this disease in order to promote early 
      and optimal care.

TI  - The many faces of peroxisomal disorders: Lessons from a large Arab cohort.
PG  - 310-319
LID - 10.1111/cge.13481 [doi]
AB  - Defects in the peroxisomes biogenesis and/or function result in peroxisomal 
      disorders. In this study, we describe the largest Arab cohort to date (72 families) 
      of clinically, biochemically and molecularly characterized patients with peroxisomal 
      disorders. At the molecular level, we identified 43 disease-causing variants, half 
      of which are novel. The founder nature of many of the variants allowed us to 
      calculate the minimum disease burden for these disorders in our population 
      ~1:30 000, which is much higher than previous estimates in other populations. 
      Clinically, we found an interesting trend toward genotype/phenotype correlation in 
      terms of long-term survival. Nearly half (40/75) of our peroxisomal disorders 
      patients had documented survival beyond 1 year of age. Most unusual among the 
      long-term survivors was a multiplex family in which the affected members presented 
      as adults with non-specific intellectual disability and epilepsy. Other unusual 
      presentations included the very recently described peroxisomal fatty acyl-CoA 
      reductase 1 disorder as well as CRD, spastic paraparesis, white matter (CRSPW) 
      syndrome. We conclude that peroxisomal disorders are highly heterogeneous in their 
      clinical presentation. Our data also confirm the demonstration that milder forms of 
      Zellweger spectrum disorders cannot be ruled out by the "gold standard" very long 
      chain fatty acids assay, which highlights the value of a genomics-first approach in 
      these cases.

TI  - [Abnormal findings during newborn period of 160 patients with early-onset 
      methylmalonic aciduria].
PG  - 410-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Methylmalonic aciduria is the most common disorder of organic acidurias 
      in the mainland of China. It is also the one of treatable metabolic disorders. The 
      clinical spectrum of the patients varies from severe neonatal-onset forms with 
      neonatal brain injury and high mortality to milder forms with adult-onset. The 
      clinical manifestations of neonates with methylmalonic aciduria are non-specific. 
      Early diagnosis and adequate treatment contribute a lot to improving the prognosis 
      of the patients. In this study, the abnormal clinical and laboratory findings in 
      neonatal period of 160 Chinese patients with early-onset methylmalonic aciduria were 
      investigated. METHOD: From 1996 to 2011, a total of 398 patients with methylmalonic 
      aciduria were diagnosed in our hospital; 286 (71.9%) patients had early-onset before 
      1 year of age. Among 286 patients, 160 (55.9%) presented symptoms in neonatal 
      period. Their urine organic acids were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass 
      spectrometry. Blood amino acids and acylcarnitine profiles were determined by liquid 
      chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Serum and urine total homocysteine were 
      measured using a fluorescence polarization immunoassay. In some patients, gene 
      analysis was performed. Based on the disease types and general condition, individual 
      dietary and medical interventions were started soon after diagnosis. RESULT: Out of 
      the 160 patients, 131 (81.9%) had combined methylmalonic aciduria and 
      homocysteinemia. Isolated methylmalonic aciduria was found in 29 cases (18.1%). The 
      common presentations in neonatal period were feeding difficulty, seizures, lethargy 
      and dyspnea. Megaloblastic anemia, liver dysfunction, hyperammonemia and metabolic 
      acidosis were the frequent findings in the routine laboratory test. The most common 
      initial clinical diagnosis was suspected hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. Even in 36 
      cases with abnormal family history, only 3 patients were admitted with suspected 
      inborn errors of metabolism. Five cases (3.1%) were diagnosed by postmortem 
      metabolic examination; 7 cases (4.4%) were detected by newborn screening. In 148 
      cases (92.5%), the diagnosis was much delayed to the age of one month to 8 years and 
      5 months (mean 13 months). Methylmalonic aciduria combined with homocysteinemia 
      (MMACHC) gene analyses were performed in 31 cases with combined methylmalonic 
      aciduria. CblC defect was confirmed. The patients with isolated methylmalonic 
      aciduria were treated with protein-restricted diet, cobalamin and L-carnitine. The 
      patients of methylmalonic aciduria combined with homocysteinemia were treated with 
      cobalamin, L-carnitine, calcium folinate, betaine and common diet. Seven patients 
      died without treatment. Clinical improvement was observed in 153 patients. Only 2 
      patients detected by newborn screening had normal mental and physical development. 
      Mild to severe psychomotor retardation was observed in 151 cases. CONCLUSION: High 
      mortality and disability rates were observed in the patients with early-onset 
      methylmalonic aciduria. Combined methylmalonic aciduria and homocysteinemia is the 
      common type of methylmalonic aciduria. The clinical manifestation in neonatal period 
      of the patients with early-onset methylmalonic aciduria is complex. Feeding 
      difficulty, seizures, lethargy and dyspnea are the common symptoms in neonatal 
      period of the patients. Megaloblastic anemia, liver dysfunction, hyperammonemia and 
      metabolic acidosis were the frequent laboratory findings.
