        "Abstract": "Mental retardation (MR) is a group of heterogeneous clinical conditions. There are  more than 900 genetic disorders associated with MR and it affects around 3% of the  general population. MR can be subdivided into syndromic, if it is characterized by  consistent and distinctive clinical findings, and nonspecific, if mental retardation  is the only primary symptom among affected individuals. Many MR conditions described  are syndromic, fragile X syndrome being the most common clinical entity among them.  In the past years, knowledge of the molecular basis of mental retardation has  increased remarkably. Eight genes involved in nonspecific X-linked MR have been  identified so far, including FMR2, OPHN1, GDI1, PAK3, IL1RAPL, TM4SF2, VCX-A, and  ARHGEF6. Two other genes also located on the X chromosome have been involved both in  syndromic and in MRX forms (RSK2 and XNP/ATR-X). New insights into the pathogenesis  of mental retardation are being provided by the discovery of these genes involved in  different cellular signaling pathways in the central nervous system although many  others remain to be identified.",

        "Abstract": "Clinical manifestations and other aspects of nonspecific X-linked mental retardation  are reviewed using data from the literature and information on affected males in 24  new families ascertained in British Columbia. A great degree of variability was  apparent in the mental abilities of affected males. Speech defects, other CNS  disorders and minor physical changes such as \"big\" ears or a highly arched palate  were not present in many cases. Evidence for the existence of a clinical entity of  mental retardation associated with the fragile site at Xq27 or 28 and  macro-orchidism is discussed. Genetic phenomena of reduced penetrance in males and  of partial expression in females with respect of X-linked recessive genes are  examined. Consideration is given to the question of whether this type of mental  retardation is due to X-linked recessive or autosomal dominant sex-limited genes.  Most ascertained cases of X-linked mental retardation are from families of northern  European extraction. Recommendations are made regarding the diagnosis and counseling  of X-linked mental retardation cases.",

Mental retardation (MR) is often  associated with other neurologic symptoms, metabolic disorders, or malformation  syndromes. The purpose of the review is to subdivide the large field of MR into  categories that may help professionals in making a diagnosis. Nonspecific MR can  also segregate in families and the mapping and cloning of corresponding mutant genes  will eventually advance our understanding of normal and abnormal brain functioning.  Several genes responsible for nonspecific X-linked mental retardation have been  identified in the last 12 to 24 months and are being intensively investigated. This  will hopefully lead to new possibilities of either genetic or pharmacological  therapy.",

        "Abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Non-specific mental retardation is defined by the absence of somatic,  neurological, biochemical or behavioural features that characterise a particular  clinical variant and accounts for a large percentage of cases of X-linked mental  retardation (XLMR). Genetic linkage studies showed it to have a high rate of genetic  heterogeneity. DEVELOPMENT: To date, genetic linkage studies or the characterisation  of chromosomal rearrangement in patients have allowed 22 different genes to be  identified. Some of the most notable of these are the genes responsible for  syndromic forms, such as RPS6KA3, ARX, JARID1C, XNP or MeCP2, in which the mildest  mutations, with a certain amount of functional activity, cause non-specific  retardation. The proteins these genes code for are directly or indirectly involved  in regulating the expression of other genes. Moreover, genes such as OPHN1, PAK3,  ARHGEF6, FGD1 or TM4SF2 code for proteins that interact with rho GTPases, and play a  role in the transmission of signals that regulate the development of axons and  dendrites. Other types of functions of the known genes include establishing and  modulating synapses (DLG3, IL1RAPL, NLGN4X, GDI1), regulating transcription (ZNF41,  ZNF81, PQBP1) translation (FTSJ1), and fatty acid metabolism (FACL4), etc.  CONCLUSIONS: Each gene that has been identified only accounts for a minor fraction  of the total amount of XLMR, and even if taken together they still do not explain  half the cases of non-specific XLMR. The number of XLMR genes is expected to rise in  coming years with the development of new techniques that will facilitate diagnosis  and genetic counselling in the relatively near future.",

Up to 60 genes have  been implicated in XLMR and certain mutations can alternatively lead to MRXS or MRX.  Indeed the extreme phenotypic and allelic heterogeneity of XLMR makes the  classification of most genes difficult. Therefore, following identification of new  genes, accurate retrospective clinical evaluation of patients and their families is  necessary to aid the molecular diagnosis and the classification of this  heterogeneous group of disorders. Analyses of the protein products corresponding to  XLMR genes show a great diversity of cellular pathways involved in MR. Common  mechanisms are beginning to emerge : a first group of proteins belongs to the Rho  and Rab GTPase signaling pathways involved in neuronal differentiation and synaptic  plasticity and a second group is related to the regulation of gene expression. In  this review, we illustrate the complexity of XLMR conditions and present recent data  about the FMR1, ARX and Oligophrenin 1 genes.",

Its prevalence has been estimated as 1.8/1000 males with a carrier  frequency of 2.4/1000 females. X-linked mental retardation is divided into syndromic  and non-specific types. At present there are about 135 syndromic forms known of 26  of which the responsible genes and mutations have been found. 8 genes are known in  which mutations have been found in non-specific X-linked mental retardation. It is  estimated that about 100 genes are involved in the latter. These genes are in  particular involved in the function of the central nervous system. The development  of a complete genetic map of the X-chromosome and the introduction of microarray  techniques will in the short term enormously enhance the elucidation of X-linked  mental retardation.",

        "Abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The higher prevalence of nonspecific mental retardation (NSMR) presents  an important socioeconomic and medical issue for families and the whole QinBa region  in China. The obvious family aggregation and high heritability indicated that  genetic causes play a role in the NSMR population in QinBa. This study discusses the  relationship between Xq12-Xq23 region and NSMR in the QinBa area. METHOD: We chose  six short tandem repeats--DXS7132, DXS6979, DXS1191, DXS1230, DXS1072, and DXS6804,  located in Xq12-Xq23--and analyzed the distribution difference of their alleles  between the NSMR and control boys. RESULTS: A significant allele distribution  difference was found between NSMR and control boys (all P<0.05) for DXS7132,  DXS1191, DXS1230, DXS1072, and DXS6804 but not for DXS6979. CONCLUSION: Our results  suggest that Xq12-Xq23 may be the candidate region where there are one or more loci,  linked to NSMR in the QinBa region. Further study needs to be carried out for  locating the gene responsible for NSMR in this region and a larger sample size and  more genetic markers are needed.",

Intertwined with each theme is a mounting body of research  on genetic mental retardation syndromes. We first review recent progress in each of  the three domains--psychopathology, families, and development--based on studies of  groups with heterogenous or nonspecific mental retardation. We then show how new  findings from specific genetic syndromes take this knowledge even further, as well  as aid in the search for genetic, physiological, and environmental mechanisms  associated with certain behaviors. We end the review by briefly summarizing our  reasons for promoting an etiological approach to future mental retardation research,  as well as by discussing methodological and other challenges.",

        "Abstract": "Data on nonspecific mental retardation in two or more sibs ascertained from the  British Columbia Health Surveillance Registry are utilized to calculate the  frequency of X-linked mental retardation in the population of British Columbia  (B.C.). In the 1950-1969 birth cohort there are 107 sibships with only males  affected and 35 sibships with only females affected giving an excess of 72  male-affected sibships. Family histories of the sibships with two more more mentally  retarded males provide evidence that the mothers of the excess of male-affected  sibships are carriers of X-linked mental retardation. Thus, a frequency of 1.83 per  1,000 males for X-linked mental retardation and carrier frequency of 2.44 per 1,000  females are calculated. This frequency can account for all the excess of males in  the population who are affected with nonspecific mental retardation. We estimate  that seven to 19 X-linked genes exist to cause nonspecific mental retardation, and  that the frequency of the marker-X chromosome, associated with X-linked mental  retardation in some families, may be 0.92 per 1,000 male births.",

        "Abstract": "X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) is an inherited condition that causes failure to  develop cognitive abilities, owing to mutations in a gene on the X chromosome. The  latest XLMR update lists up to 136 conditions leading to 'syndromic', or 'specific',  mental retardation (MRXS) and 66 entries leading to 'nonspecific' mental retardation  (MRX). For 9 of the 66 MRX entries, the causative gene has been identified. Our  recent discovery of the contiguous gene deletion syndrome ATS-MR (previously known  as Alport syndrome, mental retardation, midface hypoplasia, elliptocytosis, OMIM  #300194), characterized by Alport syndrome (ATS) and mental retardation (MR),  indicated Xq22.3 as a region containing one mental retardation gene. Comparing the  extent of deletion between individuals with ATS-MR and individuals with ATS alone  allowed us to define a critical region for mental retardation of approximately 380  kb, containing four genes. Here we report the identification of two point mutations,  one missense and one splice-site change, in the gene FACL4 in two families with  nonspecific mental retardation. Analysis of enzymatic activity in lymphoblastoid  cell lines from affected individuals of both families revealed low levels compared  with normal cells, indicating that both mutations are null mutations. All carrier  females with either point mutations or genomic deletions in FACL4 showed a  completely skewed X-inactivation, suggesting that the gene influences survival  advantage. FACL4 is the first gene shown to be involved in nonspecific mental  retardation and fatty-acid metabolism.",

Causative mutations have  recently been identified in both syndromic X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) and in  the genetically heterogeneous 'nonspecific' forms of XLMR, for which cognitive  impairment is the only defining clinical feature. Proteins that function in  chromatin remodelling are affected in three important syndromic forms of XLMR. In  nonspecific forms of the disorder, defects have been found in signal-transduction  pathways that are believed to function during neuronal maturation. These findings  provide important insights into the molecular and cellular defects that underlie  mental retardation.",

Different mutations in MECP2  are found in up to 95% of typical cases of RS. This mainly neuronal expressed gene  functions as a major transcription repressor. Extensive studies on girls who have RS  and mouse models are aimed at finding main gene targets for MeCP2 protein and  defining neuropathologic changes caused by its defects. Studies comparing autistic  features in RS with idiopathic autism and mentally retarded patients are presented.  Decreased dendritic arborization is common to RS and autism, leading to further  research on similarities in pathogenesis, including MeCP2 protein levels in autistic  brains and MeCP2 effects on genes connected to autism, like DLX5 and genes on  15q11-13 region. This area also is involved in Angelman syndrome, which has many  similarities to RS. Despite these connections, MECP2 mutations in nonspecific  autistic and mentally retarded populations are rare.",

The recent cloning of eight genes  which cause nonspecific mental retardation when mutated, provides an important  insight into the cellular mechanisms that result in the dendritic abnormalities  underlying mental retardation. Three of the encoded proteins, oligophrenin1, PAK3  and alphaPix, interact directly with Rho GTPases. Rho GTPases are key signaling  proteins which integrate extracellular and intracellular signals to orchestrate  coordinated changes in the actin cytoskeleton, essential for directed neurite  outgrowth and the generation/rearrangement of synaptic connectivity. Although many  details of the cell biology of Rho signaling in the CNS are as yet unclear, a  picture is unfolding showing how mutations that cause abnormal Rho signaling result  in abnormal neuronal connectivity which gives rise to deficient cognitive  functioning in humans.",

        "Abstract": "Mental retardation is a serious medical and social problem. The prevalence of mental  retardation is estimated at 2-3%. Establishing the cause of mental retardation is  extremely important for prognosis, management, and genetic counseling. It is  postulated that 25-35% of mental retardation cases may be of genetic background.  Among the genetic causes 25-30% are probably result of mutations located in the X  chromosome (X-linked mental retardation--XLMR). X-linked mental retardation is a  heterogeneous set of conditions responsible for a large proportion of inherited  mental retardation. More than 200 XLMR conditions and 45 cloned genes are listed in  catalogue available on the Internet. Traditionally, based on clinical presentation,  XLMR conditions were divided into specific and nonspecific forms or syndromic and  nonsyndromic. The distinction between specific and non-specific forms of XLMR is  gradually becoming less clear and spectrum of phenotypic variability is very large  as both syndromic and nonsyndromic forms have been described for several of the XLMR  genes. Mutations in patients suffering from X-linked mental retardation genes have  been found only in a relatively limited number of cases. Up to 50% of the patients  from XLMR families might have mutations in one of the known genes implicated in XLMR  so far. However, current methods are generally too expensive or too unreliable to  justify mutation screening of all known XLMR genes in diagnostic testing. Thus it is  necessary to use empirical data of recurrence risk in genetic counseling of the  family with mental retardation.",

        "Abstract": "ANKRD17 is an ankyrin repeat-containing protein thought to play a role in cell cycle  progression, whose ortholog in Drosophila functions in the Hippo pathway as a  co-factor of Yorkie. Here, we delineate a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by de  novo heterozygous ANKRD17 variants. The mutational spectrum of this cohort of 34  individuals from 32 families is highly suggestive of haploinsufficiency as the  underlying mechanism of disease, with 21 truncating or essential splice site  variants, 9 missense variants, 1 in-frame insertion-deletion, and 1 microdeletion  (1.16 Mb). Consequently, our data indicate that loss of ANKRD17 is likely the main  cause of phenotypes previously associated with large multi-gene chromosomal  aberrations of the 4q13.3 region. Protein modeling suggests that most of the  missense variants disrupt the stability of the ankyrin repeats through alteration of  core structural residues. The major phenotypic characteristic of our cohort is a  variable degree of developmental delay/intellectual disability, particularly  affecting speech, while additional features include growth failure, feeding  difficulties, non-specific MRI abnormalities, epilepsy and/or abnormal EEG,  predisposition to recurrent infections (mostly bacterial), ophthalmological  abnormalities, gait/balance disturbance, and joint hypermobility. Moreover, many  individuals shared similar dysmorphic facial features. Analysis of single-cell  RNA-seq data from the developing human telencephalon indicated ANKRD17 expression at  multiple stages of neurogenesis, adding further evidence to the assertion that  damaging ANKRD17 variants cause a neurodevelopmental disorder.",

        "Title": "[Monogenic causes of X-linked mental retardation].",
        "Abstract": "INTRODUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT: The term X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) refers to  a heterogeneous group of conditions that, on the basis of their presenting symptoms,  have traditionally been classified as being syndromic (SMR) and non-syndromic or  non-specific (XMR). The prevalence of XLMR in males is estimated to be 10%,  excluding fragile X syndrome, which is the most common monogenic cause. There are  over 100 genes involved in XLMR. In this work we review some of the phenotypes and  genes involved in SMR. A small stature and coarse features indicate a suspected case  of Coffin-Lowry syndrome, which is secondary to mutations of the RPS6KA3 or RSK2  genes. Cerebellar hypoplasia points towards alterations of the OPHN1 gene. In males  with coarse features and genital abnormalities screening for alpha thalassemia must  be carried out; this association results from mutations in the ATRX gene. Of the  genes involved in mental retardation and epilepsy, the most notable are SLC6A8  (which triggers a deficit in creatine transport when altered and which is easily  detected with respect to its biochemistry) and ARX (also associated to lissencephaly  and dystonia of the hands). Mutations in the PQBP1 and JARID1C genes have been  identified in patients with mental retardation associated to microcephaly and short  stature. A high level of T3 hormone points towards defects in the SLC16A2 gene. Some  of these genes have also been implicated in XMR, which makes this distinction less  clear molecularly speaking. CONCLUSIONS: Systematic screening of all the genes  involved in XLMR is not possible in clinical praxis today. It is important to search  for differential phenotypic features in males with mental retardation that guide the  study towards specific genes. Identification of the molecular defect will allow for  correct genetic counselling. DNA microarrays for the study of different mutations in  a large number of genes involved in mental retardation are the great hope for the  future.",

        "Title": "Range of genetic mutations associated with severe non-syndromic sporadic  intellectual disability: an exome sequencing study.",
        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The genetic cause of intellectual disability in most patients is unclear  because of the absence of morphological clues, information about the position of  such genes, and suitable screening methods. Our aim was to identify de-novo variants  in individuals with sporadic non-syndromic intellectual disability. METHODS: In this  study, we enrolled children with intellectual disability and their parents from ten  centres in Germany and Switzerland. We compared exome sequences between patients and  their parents to identify de-novo variants. 20 children and their parents from the  KORA Augsburg Diabetes Family Study were investigated as controls. FINDINGS: We  enrolled 51 participants from the German Mental Retardation Network. 45 (88%)  participants in the case group and 14 (70%) in the control group had de-novo  variants. We identified 87 de-novo variants in the case group, with an exomic  mutation rate of 1\u00b771 per individual per generation. In the control group we  identified 24 de-novo variants, which is 1\u00b72 events per individual per generation.  More participants in the case group had loss-of-function variants than in the  control group (20/51 vs 2/20; p=0\u00b7022), suggesting their contribution to disease  development. 16 patients carried de-novo variants in known intellectual disability  genes with three recurrently mutated genes (STXBP1, SYNGAP1, and SCN2A). We deemed  at least six loss-of-function mutations in six novel genes to be disease causing. We  also identified several missense alterations with potential pathogenicity.  INTERPRETATION: After exclusion of copy-number variants, de-novo point mutations and  small indels are associated with severe, sporadic non-syndromic intellectual  disability, accounting for 45-55% of patients with high locus heterogeneity.  Autosomal recessive inheritance seems to contribute little in the outbred population  investigated. The large number of de-novo variants in known intellectual disability  genes is only partially attributable to known non-specific phenotypes. Several  patients did not meet the expected syndromic manifestation, suggesting a strong bias  in present clinical syndrome descriptions.

        "Abstract": "The metabolic and anatomical substrate of most forms of mental retardation is not  known. Because the basis of normal brain function is not sufficiently understood,  the basis of abnormal function is understood poorly. Even in disorders where the  fundamental biochemical defect is known, such as phenylketonuria (PKU) and other  enzyme defects, the exact basis for brain dysfunction is uncertain. The outcome for  treated PKU, galactosemia, homocystinuria, and lysosomal disorders is not yet  optimal. The various forms of nonketotic hyperglycinemia often respond poorly to  current therapy. Less familiar disorders, with or without seizures, such as  deficient synthesis of serine or creatine and impaired glucose transport into the  brain, and disorders with variable malformations, such as Smith-Lemli-Opitz (SLO)  syndrome and the congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDGs), may initially be  thought to be a nonspecific form of developmental delay. Less familiar disorders,  with or without seizures and disorders with variable malformations may initially be  thought to be a nonspecific form of developmental delay. Simple tests of urine,  blood, and cerebrospinal fluid may lead to a diagnosis, accurate genetic counseling,  and better treatment. Metabolic brain imaging (magnetic resonance spectroscopy  (MRS)) has also helped to reveal biochemical abnormalities within the brain.",

        "Abstract": "Mental retardation (MR) is a common form of cognitive impairment among children. The  underlying causes of mental retardation are extremely heterogeneous and include  significant genetic factors. Long chain fatty acid-CoA ligase 4 is the first gene  shown to be involved in mental retardation and fatty-acid metabolism. FACL4 gene  mutations in three Italian MR pedigrees have been reported as causing non-specific  mental retardation. To investigate the possible genetic contribution of the FACL4  gene to non-specific mental retardation children of the Qin-Ba mountain region in  China we performed an association study of 556 subjects (118 NSMR, 116 borderline  NSMR, and 322 controls) from the Han children of northwestern China using five  common SNPs (rs5943427, rs12856122, rs5943418, rs7886473, and rs10126612) in the  gene. No significant differences of genotypes and alleles frequencies from each  single SNP between NSMR and controls were observed. Pairwise linkage disequilibrium  analysis showed that four SNPs rs5943427, rs12856122, rs5943418, and rs7886473 were  in strong linkage disequilibrium; therefore, a haplotype analysis was performed.  However, there were no any significant differences in haplotype distributions  between cases and controls. In conclusion, we have found no evidence for the FACL4  gene conferring susceptibility on non-specific mental retardation children of the  Qin-Ba mountain region in China.",

Approximately 200 XLMR  conditions and 45 cloned genes are now listed in our catalogue on the Internet at  http://xlmr.interfree.it/home.htm. Traditionally, XLMR conditions were subdivided  into specific (MRXS) and nonspecific (MRX) forms, depending on their clinical  presentation. Now that a growing number of candidate genes have become available for  screening XLMR families and patients, this distinction is becoming less useful and  similar conditions that had been previously listed as separate can now be grouped  together because different mutations in the same gene have been identified.  Furthermore, different mutations in the same XLMR gene may account for diseases of  increasing severity, but can also cause different phenotypes. As the functions of  proteins corresponding to these genes are characterized, biological networks  involved in causing mental retardation and conversely in supporting normal  intellectual functioning will be discovered. Molecular biologists and  neurobiologists will need to cooperate in order to verify the effects of XLMR gene  mutations in the context of neuronal circuitry. Eventually, DNA and protein  microarray technologies will assist researchers and physicians in reaching a  diagnosis even in small families or in individual patients with XLMR.",

Seven affected  males with mild to moderate mental retardation developed seizures (primarily  generalized, tonic-clonic, and atonic) that began on average at 6.8 months of age  (range, 4 to 14 months). These patients did not have a history of infantile spasms.  There were no dysmorphic features. Other than mental retardation, the neurological  examination was unremarkable, with exception of 2 affected subjects who had mild  generalized rigidity and ataxia. We identified tight linkage to a group of markers  on Xp21.1-p11.4. A maximum two-point LOD score of +3.83 at straight theta = 0 was  obtained for markers DXS8090, DXS1069, DXS8102, and DXS8085. This locus spans 7.7cM  between DXS1049 and DXS8054 and does not overlap the locus for X-linked West  syndrome. The tetraspanin gene, implicated in nonspecific mental retardation, is  mapped to this region. We sequenced the tetraspanin coding sequence in subjects with  X-linked mental retardation and epilepsy and did not identify disease-specific  mutations. The syndrome we describe, designated X-linked mental retardation and  epilepsy, is clinically and genetically distinct from X-linked West syndrome and  other X-linked mental retardation-epilepsy syndromes.",

        "Abstract": "Since the Seventh Fragile X and XLMR Mental Retardation (XLMR) Workshop in 1995, the  genes for Coffin-Lowry, Mohr-Tranebjaerg, and Opitz G/BBB syndromes have been  cloned. Jensen syndrome has been found to be allelic to Mohr-Tranebjaerg. Twenty new  XLMR syndromes and metabolic or neuromuscular disorders have been reported.  Twenty-four new localizations have been established, including five in previously  reported conditions (FG, Carpenter, Arts, OPA2, and OFD1). The number of families  with nonspecific XLMR that have been reported has continued to increase; 58 families  or loci are now known. Eighteen new families with nonspecific mental retardation  (MRX) have been reported. Two of them, however, were subsequently found to have  mutations in the RABGDIA gene, which codes for a GDP-dissociation inhibitor for RAB  proteins. In total, 41 more entries have been added to the X chromosome map of XLMR.  The total number of known syndromes and MRX families has increased to 178. Of the  120 known XLMR disorders, 53 have been mapped, and 22 have been cloned. Assuming  that at least 10 loci are necessary to account for the 58 families with MRX, the  total number of XLMR loci counted so far would be 130. Although it is likely that  many of the disorders will eventually prove to be allelic, it is not possible at  present to determine the precise number of loci for nonspecific XLMR.",

Cytogenetic expression of FRAXE was shown to skip a generation when associated with  a reduction in size of the CCG expansion when transmitted through a male; however,  in general, transmission occurred through females and a copy number increased from  one generation to the next. In these respects the behaviour of FRAXE paralleled that  of FRAXA.

        "Title": "De novo SMARCA2 variants clustered outside the helicase domain cause a new  recognizable syndrome with intellectual disability and blepharophimosis distinct  from Nicolaides-Baraitser syndrome.",
        "Abstract": "PURPOSE: Nontruncating variants in SMARCA2, encoding a catalytic subunit of SWI/SNF  chromatin remodeling complex, cause Nicolaides-Baraitser syndrome (NCBRS), a  condition with intellectual disability and multiple congenital anomalies. Other  disorders due to SMARCA2 are unknown. METHODS: By next-generation sequencing, we  identified candidate variants in SMARCA2 in 20 individuals from 18 families with a  syndromic neurodevelopmental disorder not consistent with NCBRS. To stratify variant  interpretation, we functionally analyzed SMARCA2 variants in yeasts and performed  transcriptomic and genome methylation analyses on blood leukocytes. RESULTS: Of 20  individuals, 14 showed a recognizable phenotype with recurrent features including  epicanthal folds, blepharophimosis, and downturned nasal tip along with variable  degree of intellectual disability (or blepharophimosis intellectual disability  syndrome [BIS]). In contrast to most NCBRS variants, all SMARCA2 variants associated  with BIS are localized outside the helicase domains. Yeast phenotype assays  differentiated NCBRS from non-NCBRS SMARCA2 variants. Transcriptomic and DNA  methylation signatures differentiated NCBRS from BIS and those with nonspecific  phenotype. In the remaining six individuals with nonspecific dysmorphic features,  clinical and molecular data did not permit variant reclassification. CONCLUSION: We  identified a novel recognizable syndrome named BIS associated with clustered de novo  SMARCA2 variants outside the helicase domains, phenotypically and molecularly  distinct from NCBRS.",

        "Abstract": "A large family (MRX48) with a nonspecific X-linked mental retardation condition is  described. An X-linked semidominant inheritance is suggested by the segregation in  three generations of a moderate to severe mental retardation in seven males and by a  milder intellectual impairment in two females, without any specific clinical,  radiological, or biological feature. Two-point linkage analysis demonstrated  significant linkage between the disorder and several markers in Xq28 (maximum LOD  score [Zmax] = 2.71 at recombination fraction [theta] = 0); multipoint linkage  analyses confirmed the significant linkage with a Zmax of 3.3 at theta = 0, at  DXS1684. A recombination event observed with the flanking marker DXS8011 delineates  a locus between this marker and the telomere. The approximate length of this locus  is 8-9 cM, corresponding to 5.5-6 Mb. In an attempt to explain the variable  intellectual impairment in females, we examined X-chromosome inactivation in all  females of the family. Inactivation patterns in lymphocytes were random or  moderately skewed, and no correlation between the phenotypic status and a specific  inactivation pattern was observed. The interval of assignment noted in this family  overlaps with five MRX loci previously reported in Xq28.",

        "Abstract": "Mutations in the UPF3B gene, which encodes a protein involved in nonsense-mediated  mRNA decay, have recently been described in four families with specific (Lujan-Fryns  and FG syndromes), nonspecific X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) and autism. To  further elucidate the contribution of UPF3B to mental retardation (MR), we screened  its coding sequence in 397 families collected by the EuroMRX consortium. We  identified one nonsense mutation, c.1081C>T/p.Arg361(*), in a family with  nonspecific MR (MRX62) and two amino-acid substitutions in two other, unrelated  families with MR and/or autism (c.1136G>A/p.Arg379His and c.1103G>A/p.Arg368Gln).  Functional studies using lymphoblastoid cell lines from affected patients revealed  that c.1081C>T mutation resulted in UPF3B mRNA degradation and consequent absence of  the UPF3B protein. We also studied the subcellular localization of the wild-type and  mutated UPF3B proteins in mouse primary hippocampal neurons. We did not detect any  obvious difference in the localization between the wild-type UPF3B and the proteins  carrying the two missense changes identified. However, we show that UPF3B is widely  expressed in neurons and also presents in dendritic spines, which are essential  structures for proper neurotransmission and thus learning and memory processes. Our  results demonstrate that in addition to Lujan-Fryns and FG syndromes, UPF3B protein  truncation mutations can cause also nonspecific XLMR. We also identify comorbidity  of MR and autism in another family with UPF3B mutation. The neuronal localization  pattern of the UPF3B protein and its function in mRNA surveillance suggests a  potential function in the regulation of the expression and degradation of various  mRNAs present at the synapse.",

        "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Neuroligin-4 is essential for proper brain function. Some studies  indicate a close relationship between neuroligin-4 and several human psychiatric  conditions. METHODS: The case-control method was used to study the association  between nonspecific mental retardation (NSMR) and genetic variants of neuroligin-4  gene (NLGN4). Five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs: rs5916271, rs7049300,  rs6638575, rs3810686, and rs1882260) were genotyped by PCR-RFLP/SSCP method in the  NLGN4. RESULTS: Individual SNP analysis shows significant differences at SNPs  rs3810686 and rs1882260 for allele frequency when NSMR cases and controls [odds  ratio (OR)=1.589, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.035-2.438, chi2=4.53, df=1,  P=0.033; OR=2.050, 95% CI=1.211-3.470, chi2=7.38, df=1, P=0.007, respectively] were  compared. Further haplotype analysis indicates that there are two haplotype sets,  rs3810686-rs1882260 and rs6638575-rs3810686-rs1882260, which show statistical  differences between NSMR cases and controls (chi2=6.79, df=2, global P=0.034;  chi2=9.29, df=2, global P=0.0096, respectively). CONCLUSION: The results suggest a  positive association between the genetic variants of the NLGN4 and NSMR in the  Chinese children from Qinba Mountains Region.",

Approximately half of severe cases of mental retardation are genetically  determined, and half of these fall under the category of X-linked mental retardation  (XLMR) disease. The XLMR group is currently comprised of 105 highly varied types of  retardation that can be associated with a fragile X chromosome, biochemical defect,  neurologic alterations, bony dysplasia and a range of malformations. Along with such  syndromes (which are specific), some 40 familial XLMR entities (nonspecific) can be  identified in which mental retardation is the only sign. Cytogenetic testing to  identify dysmorphic syndromes caused by chromosomal disease and molecular biology  studies are indispensable for identifying the genes responsible for XLMR syndromes.  Healthy carriers can also be found. It thus becomes possible to provide appropriate  genetic counseling for families and to achieve a prenatal diagnosis in some cases.",

We present a clinical and linkage study on 3 families with XLMR. All families  were analyzed using highly polymorphic markers covering the X chromosome; screening  for the fragile X mutation was negative. The first family (MRX 36) consisted of 1  female and 4 male patients in 3 generations and 7 healthy individuals. Considering  the female as an expressing heterozygous carrier, a maximum LOD score of 3.41 was  reached in region Xp21.2-Xp22.1. Considering her phenotype to be unknown, a LODmax  of 1.97 was reached in the same region. The second family consisted of 5 affected  and 6 healthy males with mild to borderline mental retardation. Linkage analysis  using an X-linked recessive model with full penetrance and no phenocopies excluded  linkage over almost the entire X chromosome. Using alternative models, including an  affecteds-only analysis, a LODmax of 1.49 was found in region Xq24-28. The third  family, consisting of 4 male patients with moderate mental retardation in 1  generation yielded a LODmax of 0.9 in region Xp22.13-11.3. However, even in this  small pedigree, exclusion mapping was able to exclude very large parts of the X  chromosome and in this way identify a likely candidate region.",

        "Abstract": "X-linked mental retardation is a very common condition that affects approximately 1  in 600 males. Despite recent progress, in most cases the molecular defects  underlying this disorder remain unknown. Recently, a study using the candidate gene  approach demonstrated the presence of mutations in PAK3 (p21-activating kinase)  associated with nonspecific mental retardation. PAK3 is a member of the larger  family of PAK genes. PAK proteins have been implicated as critical downstream  effectors that link Rho-GTPases to the actin cytoskeleton and to MAP kinase  cascades, including the c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38. We screened 12  MRX pedigrees that map to a large region overlying Xq21-q24. Mutation screening of  the whole coding region of the PAK3 gene was performed by using a combination of  denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and direct sequencing. We have identified a  novel missense mutation in exon 2 of PAK3 gene (R67C) in MRX47. This confirms the  involvement of PAK3 in MRX following the report of a nonsense mutation recently  reported in MRX30. In the MRX47 family, all affected males show moderate to severe  mental retardation. No seizures, statural growth deficiency, or minor facial or  other abnormal physical features were observed. This mutation R67C is located in a  conserved polybasic domain (AA 66-68) of the protein that is predicted to play a  major role in the GTPases binding and stimulation of Pak activity.",

        "Abstract": "Mutations in the methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2) cause Rett syndrome, a severe  neurodevelopmental disorder occurring predominantly in females. Male patients with  Rett syndrome are extremely rare, as the Rett-causing mutations in the MECP2 gene  are usually lethal in hemizygous males. However, different mutations in the same  gene were reported to cause mental retardation, both in sporadic non-syndromic males  as well as in syndromic families with disease manifestation in carrier females. The  majority of the reported MECP2 mutations in mentally retarded patients cause amino  acid substitutions and, especially in isolated cases, discrimination between a  disease-causing mutation and a rare polymorphism is not obvious and the significance  of each individual variation should be verified. We mapped a new non-syndromic  X-linked family (MRX79) to the chromosomal region Xq27.3-Xq28 and identified an  A140V mutation in the MEPC2 gene in all patients with the disease haplotype. In  addition to data published by others, this suggests that A140V is a recurrent  mutation (and not a polymorphism) found in patients with X-linked mental  retardation.",

        "Abstract": "FRAXE fragile site associated mental retardation remains unique among X-linked  mental retardation phenotypes due to its very mild to borderline nature (50< IQ<  85). It is the most prevalent form of non-specific X-linked mental retardation so  far delineated, with an estimated incidence of at least 1/50-100,000 males, and with  more than 50 families known worldwide. The FRAXE site is within, or immediately  adjacent to, the 5' untranslated region of the FMR2 gene. Hyperexpansion of the  FRAXE CCG repeat silences transcription of the gene. The structure of FMR2 has been  characterized, but its function remains unknown. Gene localizations for numerous (>  75) large families with non-specific X-linked mental retardation (MRX) have been  determined so far. Recently the molecular basis for some of them has been unravelled  by identification of the responsible genes, which participate in complex common  signalling pathways. This review summarises the new data on FRAXE associated mental  retardation and the FMR2 gene in the light of the recent discoveries of new genes  responsible for other forms of non-specific X-linked mental retardation.",

        "Title": "Inactivation of the CDKL3 gene at 5q31.1 by a balanced t(X;5) translocation  associated with nonspecific mild mental retardation.",
        "Abstract": "We have investigated the breakpoints of a balanced reciprocal translocation between  chromosomes X and 5, [46,X,t(X;5)(p11.1;q31.1)], in a woman with mild mental  retardation (MR). Methylation studies showed a 100% skewed X-inactivation in  patient-derived lymphocytes. Cloning and sequencing of the junction fragment from  the X derivative showed that the breakpoint occurred in intron 3 of the CDKL3 gene  on chromosome 5 and in a region devoid of genes on chromosome X. Quantitative RT-PCR  analyses on patient-derived lymphoblastoid cells documented a significant 50%  decrease of the CDKL3 transcript level. Allelic expression analysis, using an  intronic SNP that was RT-PCR amplified from CDKL3 pre-mRNA, provided further  evidence that the CDKL3 gene was transcribed from only one allele. Decreased CDKL3  gene expression was definitively confirmed at the protein level by immunoblot  analysis. CDKL3 is a member of a subset of the cdc2-related protein kinase family  that shows similarity to both mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) and  cyclin-dependant kinases (cdks). Importantly, one member of the family, CDKL5, has  been implicated in atypical Rett syndrome, West syndrome, and X-linked infantile  spasm, all including MR as a manifestation. Expression studies demonstrated that the  mouse homologue, mCdkl3, was expressed in all brain regions investigated and  throughout mouse development, a pattern that is consistent with a role in  development and brain function. Together the data suggest that haploinsufficiency of  CDKL3 in the t(X;5) patient contributes to her phenotype, and that the CDKL3 gene is  a strong candidate for nonsyndromal autosomal dominant MR.",

        "Abstract": "The high concordance for autism symptoms in monozygotic twin-pairs compared to  di-zygotic twins and/or non-twin sib-ships suggests a high genetic determinism in  autism. Those results have hypothesized multi-factorial determinism in accordance  with family studies and mathematical models. However, linkage and association or  candidate gene strategies have failed to-date to identify clearly involved  mechanisms. Mental retardation (MR) is known as frequently associated to autism.  Multiplex XLMR pedigrees have been reported with only one mutated patient having  autism and MR: different X-located MR genes have been shown to be involved (NLGN4,  MECP2, OPHN1, ZNF674 and FRAXA) which does not suggest that they could be \"autism  genes\". Tuberous sclerosis studies and report of numerous autosomal domains shown  deleted in MR-autistic subjects suggest that several autosomal dominant (AD) genes  could be also involved in MR with autism. Whereas multiplex AD-MR families are rare,  AD de novo mutations could explain numerous sporadic situations of non-specific MR  and of autism with MR, in accordance with twin studies. Finally, we hypothesize that  in those autistic subjects with mendelian MR, the XL-MR or AD-MR gene (G1) would  pave the way for a second Mendelian factor (G2) responsible for autism symptoms.",

        "Abstract": "Mental retardation affects 2-3% of the population. The identification of nonspecific  X-linked mental retardation genes represents a challenge of considerable medical and  scientific importance. AIM: An attempt to identify new genes and mutations in known  genes in 14 families with nonspecific X-linked mental retardation. MATERIAL AND  METHODS: Linkage analysis with microsatellite markers was performed in 14 families  with mental retardation segregating as an X-linked feature. Significant lod score (>  2) was obtained only for 2 families, due to insufficient number of analyzed  families' members. Known MRX genes located in the linkage intervals were analysed.  RESULTS: Analysis of selected known MRX genes enabled identification of pathogenic  mutations in 3 out of 14 families. Sequencing of further candidate genes is in  progress. In all families the critical region and the number of genes to analyze was  significantly narrowed. CONCLUSIONS: Linkage analysis in families with mental  retardation segregating as an X-linked feature is still a considerable approach  leading to identification of new genes, and mutations in known genes. It is a first  step of identification of disease background, even in small families with lod score  < 2.",

The phenotype of the reported  patients is variable, including mental retardation and subtle facial anomalies. We  report on two mother-daughter pairs, heterozygous for 3q29, and review clinical  features of all known affected individuals. Del 3q29 syndrome is associated with  nonspecific clinical features, including mild-to-moderate developmental delay,  microcephaly, and mild facial dysmorphisms such as short philtrum and high nasal  bridge. Facial anomalies were nonoverlapping and nondistinct, also within each  mother-daughter pair. Parental transmission of del 3q29 could be more frequent than  previously considered. Malformations are rare, occurring only in single subjects.  The phenotypic diversity of affected patients and the lack of distinct dysmorphisms  suggest that this disorder cannot be recognized on clinical ground alone. Del 3q29  should be searched in subjects with unexplained mild/moderate mental retardation,  microcephaly, and minor nonspecific facial anomalies.",

        "Abstract": "X-linked nonspecific mental retardation (MRX) accounts for approximately 25% of  mental retardation in males. A number of MRX loci have been mapped on the X  chromosome, reflecting the complexity of gene action in central nervous system (CNS)  specification and function. Eleven MRX genes have been identified, but many other  causative loci remain to be refined to the single gene level. In 21 MRX families,  the causative gene is located in the pericentromeric region; and we report here the  identification by linkage analysis of a further such locus, MRX81. The new MRX locus  was identified by two- and multi-point parametric analysis carried out on a large  Italian family. Tight linkage of MRX81 to DNA markers ALAS2, DXS991, and DXS7132 was  observed with a maximum LOD score of 3.43. Haplotype construction delineates an  MRX81 critical region of 8 cM, the smallest MRX pericentromeric interval so far  described, between DXS1039 and DXS1216, and placing it in Xp11.2-Xq12. So far,  automated sequencing of two candidates in the region, the MRX gene oligophrenin  (OPHN1) and the brain-specific ephrinB1 (EFNB1) gene, in DNA from affected males  excluded their candidacy for MRX81, suggesting a novel disease gene.",

        "Title": "[Diagnosis of genetic mental retardation. Protocol of study].",
        "Abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The study of mental retardation (MR) is one of the most complex fields  in human genetics, due to the fact that it presents a very high degree of clinical  and genetic heterogeneity, and both the genetic bases and the environmental factors  that act upon them are extremely complex. At the present time almost half of the  cases of MR remain undiagnosed. AIM. To present a protocol for laboratory work using  the technology that is currently available to reach a diagnosis of MR. DEVELOPMENT:  The first step is to evaluate the patient with a thorough clinical examination and  by obtaining information about the personal and family history. A suspected  diagnosis of one or several syndromes that involve MR must be confirmed, if  possible, in the laboratory with the appropriate technique. In cases of MR with no  clinical suspicion of any specific syndrome, three tests must be conducted:  karyotype, molecular study of the expansion of CGG in the FMR1 gene, and study of  the subtelomeric regions. If the study is negative and we are dealing with a  familial case with a suitable structure, a linkage study must be performed. As far  as sporadic cases are concerned, it is difficult to advance in a routine manner  although some tests allow screening several genes determinations to be carried out  on several genes at the same time. Other techniques permit to investigate in greater  depth, such as screening for genes responsible for non-specific X-linked MR or  CGH-arrays (arrays based on compared genomic hybridisation) for the whole genome or  for a particular chromosome. At the present time, however, such techniques are  limited to research projects or very special cases. CONCLUSIONS: We propose a study  protocol and highlight the importance of its use to obtain maximum performance in  order to reach a diagnosis that allows us to give genetic counselling and offer a  prenatal diagnosis for future generations.",

        "Abstract": "For several decades, it has been known that mental retardation (MR) is associated  with abnormalities in dendrites and dendritic spines. The recent cloning of seven  genes that cause nonspecific MR when mutated provides important insights in the  cellular mechanisms that result in the dendritic abnormalities associated with MR.  Three of the encoded proteins, oligophrenin 1, PAK3 and alpha PIX, interact directly  with Rho GTPases. Rho GTPases are key signaling proteins that integrate  extracellular and intracellular signals to orchestrate coordinated changes in the  actin cytoskeleton essential for directed neurite outgrowth and the regulation of  synaptic connectivity. Although many details of the cell biology of Rho signaling in  the CNS are still unclear, a picture is unfolding showing how mutations that alter  Rho signaling result in abnormal neuronal connectivity and deficient cognitive  functioning in humans. Conversely, these findings illuminate the cellular mechanisms  underlying normal cognitive function.",

        "Abstract": "In the search for genetic causes of mental retardation, we have studied a  five-generation family that includes 10 individuals in generations IV and V who are  affected with mild-to-moderate mental retardation and mild, nonspecific dysmorphic  features. The disease is inherited in a seemingly autosomal dominant fashion with  reduced penetrance. The pedigree is unusual because of (1) its size and (2) the fact  that individuals with the disease appear only in the last two generations, which is  suggestive of anticipation. Standard clinical and laboratory screening protocols and  extended cytogenetic analysis, including the use of high-resolution karyotyping and  multiplex FISH (M-FISH), could not reveal the cause of the mental retardation.  Therefore, a whole-genome scan was performed, by linkage analysis, with  microsatellite markers. The phenotype was linked to chromosome 16p13.3, and,  unexpectedly, a deletion of a part of 16pter was demonstrated in patients, similar  to the deletion observed in patients with ATR-16 syndrome. Subsequent FISH analysis  demonstrated that patients inherited a duplication of terminal 3q in addition to the  deletion of 16p. FISH analysis of obligate carriers revealed that a balanced  translocation between the terminal parts of 16p and 3q segregated in this family.  This case reinforces the role of cryptic (cytogenetically invisible) subtelomeric  translocations in mental retardation, which is estimated by others to be implicated  in 5%-10% of cases.",

        "Abstract": "X-linked nonspecific mental retardation (MRX) has a frequency of 0.15% in the male  population and is caused by defects in several different genes on the human X  chromosome. Genotype-phenotype correlations in male patients with a partial  nullisomy of the X chromosome have suggested that at least one locus involved in MRX  is on Xp22.3. Previous deletion mapping has shown that this gene resides between  markers DXS1060 and DXS1139, a region encompassing approximately 1.5 Mb of DNA.  Analyzing the DNA of 15 males with Xp deletions, we were able to narrow this MRX  critical interval to approximately 15 kb of DNA. Only one gene, VCX-A (variably  charged, X chromosome mRNA on CRI-S232A), was shown to reside in this interval.  Because of a variable number of tandem 30-bp repeats in the VCX-A gene, the size of  the predicted protein is 186-226 amino acids. VCX-A belongs to a gene family  containing at least four nearly identical paralogues on Xp22.3 (VCX-A, -B, -B1, and  -C) and two on Yq11.2 (VCY-D, VCY-E), suggesting that the X and Y copies were  created by duplication events. We have found that VCX-A is retained in all patients  with normal intelligence and is deleted in all patients with mental retardation.  There is no correlation between the presence or absence of VCX-B1, -B, and VCX-C and  mental status in our patients. These results suggest that VCX-A is sufficient to  maintain normal mental development.",

        "Abstract": "Individuals with mental disabilities are a heterogeneous group, mainly when we  consider the etiology of mental retardation (MR). Recent advances in molecular  genetics techniques have enabled us to unveil more about the molecular basis of  several genetic syndromes associated with MR. In this study, we surveyed 85  institutionalized individuals with severe MR, 38 males and 47 females, by two  molecular techniques, to detect CGG amplifications in the FMR1 gene. No FRAXA  mutations were found in the FMR1 gene, reinforcing the low prevalence of Fragile X  syndrome among institutionalized individuals with severe MR. We considered the PCR  protocol used adequate for screening males with mental retardation of unknown  etiology. The use of the Southern blot is still necessary for the decisive diagnosis  of the Fragile X syndrome. To exclude chromosomal abnormalities associated with MR  as a possible cause of the phenotype in these individuals, G-banded chromosome  analysis was performed in all patients and 7.3% of chromosomal aberrations were  found. Our results are similar to those reported previously and point to the  necessity of expanding the molecular investigation toward other causes of MR, such  as subtle chromosomal rearrangements, as suggested recent by a combination of  fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and PCR studies.",

Maladaptive behavior of 43 children with Prader-Willi syndrome  was compared to age- and gender-matched children with Down syndrome and with  nonspecific mental retardation. The Prader-Willi group showed more frequent and  severe internalizing, externalizing, and total problem behaviors on the Child  Behavior Checklist. Some problems were elevated in all groups, and 12 behaviors were  significantly elevated in Prader-Willi subjects relative to both comparison groups.  Seven behaviors predicted membership into the Prader-Willi group with 91% accuracy.  Implications were discussed for research on behavioral phenotypes in general and for  dual diagnosis in particular.",

        "Title": "Recurrent infections, hypotonia, and mental retardation caused by duplication of  MECP2 and adjacent region in Xq28.",
        "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to describe the neurologic and clinical features of affected  males from families with X-linked patterns of severe mental retardation, hypotonia,  recurrent respiratory infection, and microduplication of Xq28 that consistently  includes the MECP2 (methyl-CpG binding protein 2) gene. STUDY DESIGN: To identify  duplications, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification of the MECP2 gene was  performed on male probands from families with X-linked mental retardation. The males  either had linkage to Xq28 or had a phenotype consistent with previous reports  involving Xq28 functional disomy. After detection of a duplication of MECP2,  additional family members were tested to confirm the MECP2 duplication segregated  with the affected phenotype, and X-inactivation studies were performed on carrier  females. RESULTS: Six families with multiple affected males having MECP2  duplications were identified by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification,  and the carrier mothers were subsequently shown to have highly skewed X  inactivation. In 5 of 6 families, the microduplication extended proximally to  include the L1 cell adhesion molecule gene. The primary clinical features associated  with this microduplication are infantile hypotonia, recurrent respiratory infection,  severe mental retardation, absence of speech development, seizures, and spasticity.  CONCLUSIONS: Although many of the phenotypic features of our patients are rather  nonspecific in cohorts of individuals with syndromic and nonsyndromic mental  retardation, the proneness to infection is quite striking because the patients had  normal growth and were not physically debilitated. Although the etiology of the  infections is not understood, we recommend considering MECP2 dosage studies and a  genetics referral in individuals with severe developmental delay and neurologic  findings, especially when a history of recurrent respiratory ailments has been  documented.",

The  A140V mutation was found in all affected males and all carrier females in the  family. To date, descriptions have been published of two patients with independent  familial mental retardation (MR) and two patients with sporadic MR who harbor this  specific mutation in the MECP2 gene. This strongly suggests that A140V is a hot spot  of mutation resulting in moderate to severe MR in males. A simple and reliable PCR  approach has been developed for detection of the hot spot A140V mutation to  prescreen any other unexplained cases of MR before further extensive mutation  analyses.",

In addition, a novel deletion  associated with choroideremia and mental retardation was identified and mapped in  detail. The proximal deletion endpoint was positioned between the loci DXS995 and  DXS232, which enabled us to confirm the critical region for a locus involved in  mental retardation.

        "Abstract": "Nonspecific X-linked mental retardation (MRX) is a heterogeneous condition in which  mental retardation (MR) appears to be the only consistent manifestation. A large  genetic interval of assignment obtained on individual families by linkage analysis,  genetic, heterogeneity, and phenotypic variability usually are major obstacles to  fine-map and identify the related disease genes. Here we report on a large Tunisian  family (MRX54) with an MRX condition. X-linked recessive inheritance is strongly  suggested by the segregation of MR through seven unaffected carrier females to 14  affected males in two generations. Two-point linkage analysis demonstrated  significant linkage between the disorder and several markers in Xp21.3-22.1 (maximum  LOD score Zmax = 3.56, recombination fraction 0 = 0 at DXS1202), which was confirmed  by multipoint linkage analyses. Recombinant events observed with the flanking  markers DXS989 and DXS1218 delineate a refined locus of approximately 2.7 cM in  accordance with the physical distance between these two markers. The small interval  of assignment observed in this family overlaps not only with nine large MRX loci  previously reported in Xp21.3-22.1 but also with two inherited microdeletions in  Xp21.3-22.1 involved in nonspecific MR. Although the involvement of several genes  located in the Xp21.3-22.1 region cannot be ruled out, data reported in this study  could be used as a starting point for the search of such gene(s).",

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: X-linked \u03b1-thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome  (Mendelian Inheritance in Man, 301040) is one of the X-linked intellectual  disability syndromes caused by mutations of the ATRX gene and characterized by male  predominance, central hypotonic facies, severe cognitive dysfunction, hemoglobin H  disease (\u03b1-thalassemia), genital and skeletal abnormalities, and autistic and  peculiar behavior. More than 200 patients in the world, including >70 Japanese  patients, have been diagnosed with ATR-X syndrome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We  reviewed the brain MRI and/or CT findings of 27 Japanese patients with ATR-X with  ATRX mutations retrospectively. RESULTS: The findings were categorized into 5 types:  1) nonspecific brain atrophy (17/27); 2) white matter abnormalities, especially  around the trigones (11/27); 3) widespread and scattered white matter abnormalities  (1/27); 4) delayed myelination (4/27); and 5) severe and rapidly progressive  cortical brain atrophy (1/27). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report on a  comprehensive study of brain MRI/CT findings of ATR-X syndrome. Our findings suggest  that the ATRX protein seems to be involved in normal myelination. The classification  will require revisions in the near future, but it will be helpful in establishing  the relationship between ATRX mutation and brain development and understanding the  ATRX protein function in the brain.",

        "Abstract": "There are two forms of mental handicap associated with fragile sites on the end of  the long arm of the X chromosome. The well known common disorder Fragile X syndrome  is associated with FRAXA and a rare non-specific form of mental handicap is  associated with FRAXE. The cytogenetics of these fragile sites is considered. For  Fragile X syndrome details are given of the molecular genetics, inheritance  patterns, genetic counselling, methods for diagnosis of index cases, carrier  detection and prenatal diagnosis. Series of prenatal diagnoses are briefly reviewed  and technical and biological problems associated with this procedure are considered.  Prenatal diagnosis of Fragile X syndrome using molecular genetic techniques is now a  well established procedure, with the only significant problem being the inability to  accurately predict phenotype in female fetuses with full mutations. Few prenatal  diagnoses of Fragile XE non-specific mental retardation have been recorded. In  principle the technical aspects of such a prenatal diagnosis should be little  different from those for Fragile X syndrome. Incomplete knowledge of the phenotypic  effect of the full mutation in males and females would make phenotypic prediction  for any fetus shown to have such a mutation very difficult. At this stage all that  could be determined with precision is that the mutation was present or absent in the  fetus. Possible consequences of this are discussed.",

The aim of this study  was to identify candidate loci for nonspecific MR in Spanish samples. We selected  seven families with nonspecific MR and a pattern of inheritance compatible with an  X-linked disorder and a group of 26 sib pairs of mentally retarded individuals. We  performed linkage analysis with a panel of 15 markers evenly distributed along the X  chromosome. The study showed linkage to marker DXS8076, located in Xq21.1, by the  lod score method (z = 2.11 at straight theta = 0.155) and the nonparametric extended  relative pair analysis method (chi(2) = 5.32; P < 0.03). Genetic heterogeneity was  found, with an estimated 75% of the families linked at recombination fraction  straight theta = 0.10 to the DXS8076 locus (chi(2) = 9.51; P < 0.009). Xq13-q21 is  one of the critical regions for X-linked MR previously reported, and our study  supports the idea that this region may contain a locus for MR in Spanish patients.",

        "Abstract": "This review covers the history and nosology of X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) in  which the following, largely clinically based, subclassification was used: fragile X  syndrome (FRAXA), syndromic forms (MRXS) and non-specific forms (MRX). After the  discovery of the FMR2 gene at the FRAXE site, 10 MRX genes have been identified in  the last 6 years. A short description is given of the strategies used to identify  the genes that cause mental retardation (MR). Furthermore, their potential functions  and the association with MR will be discussed. It is emphasized that mutations in  several of these MR genes can result in non-specific, as well as in syndromic forms  of XLMR. Present findings stress the importance of accurate clinical evaluation.  Most considerably, genotype-phenotype correlation studies of affected individuals in  XLMR families with MRX gene mutations are necessary to define the criteria of MRX vs  MRXS subclassification.",

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: In mental retardation (MR) an aetiological diagnosis is not always  obtained despite a detailed history, physical examination and metabolic or genetic  investigations. In some of these patients, MRI is recommended and may identify  subtle abnormal brain findings. OBJECTIVE: We reviewed the cerebral MRI of children  with non-specific mental retardation in an attempt to establish a neuroanatomical  picture of this disorder. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty children with non-specific  MR were selected to undergo cerebral MRI. The examination included supratentorial  axial slices, mid-sagittal images and posterior fossa coronal images. Brain  malformations, midline and cerebellar abnormalities were studied. RESULTS: In 27 of  30 patients, the neuroimaging evaluation revealed a relatively high incidence of  cerebral and posterior fossa abnormalities. The most frequent were: dysplasia of the  corpus callosum (46%; hypoplasia, short corpus callosum and vertical splenium),  partially opened septum pellucidum and/or cavum vergae (33%), ventriculomegaly  (33%), cerebral cortical dysplasia (23%), subarachnoid space enlargement (16.6%),  vermian hypoplasia (33%), cerebellar and/or vermian disorganised folia (20%), and  subarachnoid spaces enlargement in the posterior fossa (20%). Other anomalies were:  enlarged Virchow-Robin spaces (10%), white matter anomalies (10%) and cerebellar or  vermian atrophy. CONCLUSIONS: MRI has shown a high incidence of subtle cerebral  abnormalities and unexpected minor forms of cerebellar cortical dysplasia. Even if  most of these abnormalities are considered as subtle markers of brain dysgenesis,  their role in the pathogenesis of mental retardation needs further investigation.",

        "Title": "Implication of screening for FMR1 and FMR2 gene mutation in individuals with  nonspecific mental retardation in Taiwan.",
        "Abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of familial mental retardation  (MR), attributable to (CGG)n expansion in the FMR1 gene. FRAXE is less frequent,  associated with a similar mutation of the FMR2 gene. This study attempted to  ascertain the prevalence of both disorders in Taiwan, as well as to develop a method  to effectively find carriers. A total of 321 patients with nonspecific MR were  screened for the FMR1 and FMR2 mutation. Four of 206 boys and men (1.9%) and 1 in  115 girls and women (0.9%) were identified as having FXS. All four FXS boys or men  could be identified by Southern blot analysis, as well as by a simple nonradioactive  polymerase chain reaction analysis. None of the 206 boys or men had FMR2 full  mutation. This confirmed the low incidence of FRAXE in Chinese. FXS appears to be  more prevalent among patients with mild MR, because 4 of the 5 patients with FXS  were from the 115 with mild MR (3.48%) and only 1 was from the other 206 with severe  MR (0.49%). All five FXS cases were maternally inherited. Other family members were  resistant to further searching for carriers. It is worth noting that none of these  mothers had a discernible premarital family history of MR. Thus the negative family  history could not preclude the possibility that a woman was a carrier. To identify  female carriers of childbearing age, beyond the scope of family history, is thus  worthy of further exploration. Screening men for carriers using this inexpensive  method is probably feasible, even though normal transmitting men have no immediate  risk of producing a child with the disease. Female carriers can then be effectively  identified from these normal transmitting men and can take all preventive measures.",

It is becoming evident  that a large proportion of mental retardation is genetically determined, which means  that it can be molecularly defined and thus precisely diagnosed. Building knowledge  and understanding about molecular processes leading to 'malfunction of human brain'  will clearly bring benefits to patient management, disease prevention and ultimately  disease treatment and will also assist in tackling much harder questions of the  molecular basis of human cognitive ability. In this review the current knowledge of  the molecular genetics of X-chromosome-linked mental retardation and its nonspecific  forms in particular is discussed, together with limitations affecting diagnosis and  likely new approaches that need to be implemented.",

Presently, there are at least three major  subdivisions of X-linked MR. The IQ of affected males is variable. Carrier females  usually have normal intelligence but some do show partial expression resulting in  retardation.

        "Title": "Unexplained mental retardation: is brain MRI useful?",
        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mental retardation (MR), defined as an IQ below 70, is a frequent cause  of consultation in paediatrics. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the yield of brain MRI in the  diagnostic work-up of unexplained MR in children. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The MRI  features and clinical data of 100 patients (age 1-18 years) affected with  non-progressive MR of unknown origin were compared to an age-matched control group  (n=100). Two radiologists conducted an independent review of the MRI scans. RESULTS:  Univariate and multivariate analyses showed a higher incidence of brain anomalies in  the MR group than in the control group (53 vs 17, OR=5.7 [2.9-11.1]), for signal  abnormalities within the periventricular white matter (OR=20.3 [2.6-155.3]), lateral  ventricular dilatation (OR=15.6 [2.0-124]), mild corpus callosum abnormalities  (shortness, atrophy) (OR=6.8 [1.8-25.6]) and subtle cerebellar abnormalities,  including fissure enlargement (OR=5.2 [1.1-26.2]). The diagnostic value of MRI  abnormalities was considered good in 5% of patients (Alexander disease n=1, diffuse  cortical malformation n=1, leukomalacia n=1, vermian agenesis n=1, commissural  agenesis n=1), and weak in 48% of patients, in whom non-specific abnormalities did  not lead to a diagnosis. Some clinical features resulted in a significantly higher  percentage of abnormal MRI scans: abnormal neurological examination (82% vs 47%,  P=0.008), abnormal skull circumference (66% vs 49%, P=0.04). Motor delay was  associated with cerebellar abnormalities (P=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms  the weak diagnostic yield of MRI in mentally retarded children. The use of a control  group has enabled us to identify the neuroimaging markers frequently associated with  MR. Subgrouping patients according to neuroimaging markers and clinical signs should  help identify those who would benefit from molecular studies.",

Previous studies have suggested that distinctive speech and language characteristics  are associated with the syndrome. Twelve adult male residents of an institution for  the retarded (aged 23 to 51 years) were compared on a series of speech and language  measures to 12 adult males with nonspecific forms of MR who were residents of the  same institution and were matched on age and IQ. A second contrast group consisted  of similarly matched autistic men. Results revealed that there were no significant  differences among the groups' performance, with the exception of increased rates of  echolalia in the autistic group. A nonsignificant trend toward poorer performance on  expressive measures on the part of the fragile X group was noted. The implications  of these findings for further research on the syndrome are discussed.",

        "Title": "Non-specific X-linked semidominant mental retardation by mutations in a Rab  GDP-dissociation inhibitor.",
        "Abstract": "Non-specific X-linked mental retardation (MRX) is a very common disorder which  affects approximately 1 in 600 males. Despite this high frequency, little is known  about the molecular defects underlying this disorder, mainly because of the clinical  and genetic heterogeneity which is evident from linkage studies. Recently, a  collaborative study using the candidate gene approach demonstrated the presence of  mutations in GDIalpha, a Rab GDP-dissociation inhibitor encoded by a gene localized  in Xq28, associated with non-specific mental retardation. GDIalpha is mainly a  brain-specific protein that plays a critical role in the recycling of Rab GTPases  involved in membrane vesicular transport. The study presented here was designed to  assess the prevalence of mutations in the GDIalpha in mentally retarded patients and  to discuss the clinical phenotypes observed in affected individuals. Mutation  screening of the whole coding region of the GDIalpha gene, using a combination of  denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and direct sequencing, was carried out in  164 patients found negative for expansions across the FRAXA GCC repeat. In addition  to the nonsense mutation recently reported in MRX48, we have identified a novel  missense mutation in exon 11 of the GDIalpha gene in one familial form of  non-specific mental retardation. In this family (family R), all affected males show  moderate to severe mental retardation, and the X-linked semidominant inheritance is  strongly suggested by the severe phenotypes in males with respect to mildly affected  females or unaffected obligatory carriers. This study showed that the prevalence of  GDIalpha mutations in non-specific mental retardation could be estimated to be  0.5-1%, and molecular diagnosis and genetic counselling in some cases of  non-specific mental handicap can now be provided.",

In 51 individuals, the retardation occurred as an isolated  event within the family, whereas 30 patients had a family history of retardation. In  39 of the isolated individuals, the retardation was either related to environmental  factors or associated with a major neurological abnormality. The remaining 12  patients were phenotypically normal with no cytogenetic abnormality. Of the 30  probands from 15 families with a history of retardation, 3 families had X-linked  syndromes. One, with 4 proband daughters, had the mar(X) syndrome and two families  were considered to have the phenotypically similar syndrome but without  demonstrating the mar(X). In an additional 5 families, the distribution and clinical  features of the affected individuals were compatible with nonspecific X-linked  mental retardation.",

        "Abstract": "Mutations in the methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2) gene are known to underlie  Rett' syndrome, the most common cause of mental retardation (MR) in girls. Since the  original report, phenotypes resulting from MECP2 mutations have been shown to  extend, for example, to several Rett variants, autism, atypical Angelman syndrome,  and nonspecific MR. It was earlier proposed that MECP2 mutations might account for  approximately 2% of the male cases with nonspecific MR. Thereby, the frequency of  MECP2 mutations in the mentally retarded population would be comparable to that of  Fragile-X syndrome. The aim of this study was to analyze well-characterized cases  with MR and to clarify the role of the MECP2 gene in the etiology of MR and atypical  Angelman syndrome. The coding sequence of the MECP2 gene was analyzed in a sample of  118 patients (103 males, 15 females) by direct sequencing. Two coding sequence  variants, 602C > T (A201V) and 1189G > A (E397K), were identified. In addition, we  identified four variants in the intronic or 3'UTR regions. None of these variants is  likely to be causal. We conclude that the evidence across all the mutation screening  studies implies that MECP2 mutations do not represent a major cause of nonspecific  MR.",

Thyroid hormones are essential in brain development, which takes  place during foetal life and early postnatal life up to the 2nd year of age. The  main etiologic factors of congenital hypothyroidism are anomalies of development,  function and regulation of the thyroid gland. Clinical signs of thyroid hormone  deficiency in infants are non-specific. Early diagnosis is based on newborn  screening for congenital hypothyroidism, which was started in Poland in 1977.  Treatment within the first days of life with appropriate dosage of thyroxine  prevents mental retardation. This paper summarises current knowledge on congenital  hypothyroidism in children.",

More recently, this goal has been redefined to  include narrowing these localizations and cloning specific genes. In the last 5  years, 61 families have participated in this study; 34 have a projected or actual  lod score greater than 2.0. Restudy of 12 families reported previously has been a  particularly productive aspect of this study and has led to clinical redefinition  and new or improved localization of most of these syndromes. Five possible new XLMR  syndromes have been identified. Five large families with nonspecific XLMR have been  regionally localized. Since many XLMR conditions are based on only 1 or 2 family  reports, one of the major purposes of this summary is to provide clinical data on  the study families so that collaborative projects can be undertaken with other  centers that have similar families.",

        "Abstract": "A large French family including members affected by nonspecific X-linked mental  retardation, with or without autism or pervasive developmental disorder in affected  male patients, has been found to have a 2-base-pair deletion in the Neuroligin 4  gene (NLGN4) located at Xp22.33. This mutation leads to a premature stop codon in  the middle of the sequence of the normal protein and is thought to suppress the  transmembrane domain and sequences important for the dimerization of neuroligins  that are required for proper cell-cell interaction through binding to  beta-neurexins. As the neuroligins are mostly enriched at excitatory synapses, these  results suggest that a defect in synaptogenesis may lead to deficits in cognitive  development and communication processes. The fact that the deletion was present in  both autistic and nonautistic mentally retarded males suggests that the NLGN4 gene  is not only involved in autism, as previously described, but also in mental  retardation, indicating that some types of autistic disorder and mental retardation  may have common genetic origins.",

        "Title": "Mutations in GDI1 and X-linked non-specific mental retardation.",
        "Abstract": "Mental retardation (MR) is a complex phenotype characterized by suboptimal  functioning of the central nervous system (CNS). It is estimated that from 1 to 3%  of the general population is affected with MR. MR or \"intellectual disability\" can  be caused by genetic as well as environmental causes that act on the development and  functioning of the CNS prenatally, perinatally or postnatally. Genetic causes of MR  include chromosome aneusomies, chromosome structural abnormalities, genomic  disorders and monogenic diseases. Amongst children, acute MR (QI < 50) is estimated  at 0.4% and faint MR is about 2.5-3%. To determine the etiology of the MR, many  diagnostic studies have been conducted and they show that MR is very heterogeneous  and its etiology is not yet known in 20-50% of the group of patients with severe MR.  This percentage increases up to 75-80% in the group of individuals with mild or  \"borderline\" forms of MR. In light of the literature results, we tried to carry out  a screening of 41 subjects with nonspecific MR for the detection of mutations in the  gene GDI1 using the DHPLC methodology. This technique has the following advantages:  low cost, high sensitivity (> 95%), and it can be done quickly. We have found 3  nucleotide (nt) substitutions: an intronic polymorphism at nt 107877 A --> C, a  polymorphism in exon 3 at nt 109259 T --> C (Asn73Asn), and an intronic polymorphism  at nt 110314 G --> C. The mutations in this gene are common and do not seem to  influence the gene expression so as to cause a change in phenotype. These results  therefore do not encourage the research of a diagnostic protocol designed for  mutational analysis of the GDI1 human gene as the only responsible factor for a  complex disease as Mental Retardation X-linked (MRX).",

        "Abstract": "Mental retardation (MR) affects approximately 2% of the population. About 10% of all  MR cases result from defects of X-linked genes. Mutations in most of more than 20  known genes causing nonspecific form of X-linked MR (MRX) are very rare and may  account for less than 0.5-1% of MR. Linkage studies in extended pedigrees followed  by mutational analysis of known MRX genes in the linked interval are often the only  way to identify a genetic cause of the disorder. We performed linkage analysis in  several MRX families, and in one family with four males with MR we mapped the  disease to an interval encompassing Xp21.2-22.11 (with a maximum LOD score of 2.71).  Subsequent mutation analysis of genes located in this interval allowed us to  identify a partial deletion of the IL1RAPL1 gene. Different nonoverlapping deletions  involving IL1RAPL1 have been reported previously, suggesting that this region could  be deletion-prone. In this report, we present the results of the molecular analyses  and clinical examinations of four affected family members with the deletion in  IL1RAPL1. Our data further confirm the importance and usefulness of linkage studies  for gene mapping in MRX families and demonstrate that IL1RAPL1 plays an important  role in the etiology of MRX. With the development of new methods (aCGH, MLPA),  further rearrangements in this gene (including deletions and duplications) might be  discovered in the nearest future.",

Multipoint linkage analysis showed negative LOD  values over all other regions of the chromosome. In the second family, MRX50, 4  males in 2 generations showed moderate mental retardation. Pairwise linkage analysis  with 28 polymorphic markers yielded a LOD score of 2.056 with markers DXS8054,  DXS1055, and DXS1204, all at theta = 0.0.

The number of families with nonspecific  XLMR with a LOD score of > or = 2.0 has more than doubled, with 42 (including FRAXE)  now being known. a summary of the localization of presumed nonspecific mental  retardation (MR) genes from well-studied X-chromosomal translocations and deletions  is also included. Only 10-12 nonoverlapping loci are required to explain all  localizations of nonspecific MR from both approaches. These new trends mark the  beginning of a significantly improved understanding of the role of genes on the X  chromosome in producing MR.

        "Abstract": "X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) is a genetically heterogeneous condition, due to  mutations in at least 50 genes, involved in functioning of the central nervous  system and located on the X chromosome. Nonspecific XLMR (MRX) is characterized  essentially by mental retardation transmitted by X-linked inheritance. More than 80  extended MRX pedigrees have been reported to date, which have been distinguished  exclusively by physical position of the corresponding gene on the X chromosome,  established by linkage analysis. One such family, MRX21, which was described by us  in 1993 and localized to Xp11.4-pter, has now been reanalyzed with additional  markers and after one more affected individual had became available. This extra  information allowed a significant reduction of the linkage interval and, eventually,  identification of the mutant gene. A stop mutation in exon 10 of the IL1RAPL1 gene  (in Xp21) was found in the four affected males and in obligate carriers, allowing  conclusive counseling of other family members of uncertain carrier status. The W487X  mutation results in the production of a truncated IL1RAPL protein, comprised of the  extracellular Ig-like domain and transmembrane tract, but lacking the last 210  aminoacids of the cytoplasmic domain. MRX21 is the first extended MRX family with a  point mutation in IL1RAPL1 and the second with a stop mutation, which had been  previously found only in a small family. Our report confirms the role of the  IL1RAPL1 gene in causing nonspecific mental retardation in males and underlines the  importance of detailed linkage analysis before candidate gene mutational screening.",

        "Abstract": "Plasticity includes the brain's capacity to be shaped or moulded by experience, the  capacity to learn and remember, and the ability to reorganize and recover after  injury. Mechanisms for plasticity include activity-dependent refinement of neuronal  connections and synaptic plasticity as a substrate for learning and memory. The  molecular mechanisms for these processes utilize signalling cascades that relay  messages from synaptic receptors to the nucleus and the cytoskeleton to control the  structure of axons and dendrites. Several paediatric neurological disorders such as  neurofibromatosis-1, Fragile X syndrome, Rett syndrome, and other syndromic and  non-specific forms of mental retardation involve lesions in these signalling  pathways. Acquired disorders such as hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy, lead  poisoning and epilepsy also involve signalling pathways including excitatory  glutamate receptors. Information about these 'plasticity pathways' is useful for  understanding their pathophysiology and potential therapy.",

There are at least 26 genes involved in the  biosynthesis and transport of GPI-anchored proteins (GPI-APs). Many inherited GPI  deficiencies (IGDs) have been recently found using whole-exome sequencing. Patients  with IGD have only a partial deficiency because complete GPI deficiency causes  embryonic death. The major symptoms of IGDs include intellectual disability,  epilepsy, coarse facial features, and multiple organ anomalies. These symptoms vary  in severity depending upon the degree of the defect and/or position in the pathway  of the affected gene. We clarified a mechanism of hyperphosphatasia, which is  characterized by elevated release of tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase.  Hyperphosphatasia is observed in some patients with IGDs, such as hyperphosphatasia  mental retardation syndrome or Mabry syndrome, caused by mutations in genes in the  later stage of GPI biosynthesis.

We report linkage data in a Spanish family with  MRX, using polymorphic DNA markers distributed over the X chromosome. Two-point  linkage analysis demonstrated close linkage between the MRX locus and DXS85 in  Xp22.3 with a peak lod score of 2.28 at a theta = 0.00. Analysis of multiple  informative meioses suggested a localization of the MRX locus (MRX24) between DXS278  and DXS207. Multipoint linkage analysis resulted in a maximum LOD score of 2.45 at 3  cM proximal to DXS85, and allowed us to reject a localization of the MRX24 gene in  all other regions from Xp21-Xqter. These findings localize the MRX24 gene in the  chromosomal region Xp22.2-p22.3.",

Significant linkage was found in the Xq28 region with  loci DXS52, DXS15, BGN, and DXS1108 with maximum LOD scores of 4.86, 4.01, 4.83, and  5.43, respectively, at theta = 0.00. Recombination was observed at the locus  DXS1113, thus mapping the gene in an 8-Mb interval between this marker and the Xq  telomere. Linkage intervals of three other MRX families overlap with this interval  in Xq28 where the RABGDIA gene, mutated in the MRX41 and MRX48 families, is also  located. In MRX3, MRX28, but also in MRX16, no alteration of RABGDIA has been found,  thus suggesting the existence of at least two MRX genes in distal Xq28.",

We have surveyed nine journals from  1985-1990 to identify use of these two distinct research approaches, or cultures.  After providing brief vignettes to delineate the separateness of the two cultures,  we documented the varied effects that genetic etiology may have on behavior. The  problems and issues inherent in reconciling these two research cultures were also  emphasized, including variability within etiological groups, etiologic specificity  versus nonspecificity, and service delivery implications. Several points of  reconciliation between the two research cultures were offered, with the goal being  better integrated approaches to the study of behavior in mental retardation.",

This paper reviews the issues involved in  designing such studies and interpreting their results and suggests that the best  approach to matching may be to equate performance on carefully designed control  tasks. However, we also argue that the interpretation of such studies is often  complicated by the fact that associations between background measures and  experimental task performance are not clear. Consequently, we also advocate the use  of regression techniques that allow the researcher to determine the factors that  relate to task performance and to assess the extent of group differences on the task  of interest having taken these factors into account.",

We have studied 146 Indian patients (174 X chromosomes) with unexplained mental  retardation by molecular methods. All study subjects were unrelated. Three of the  118 males were found to have the FMR1 full mutation. None of the patients tested  were positive for the FMR2 full mutation. The Fragile X prevalence was 2.5% among  males, which is lower than previously reported in Indian mentally retarded patients.  Screening for Fragile X among patients with nonspecific mental retardation is  important, even if there is no family history of mental retardation or typical  behavioral or physical features associated with the Fragile-X phenotype.  Identification of positive cases is also very important for the families, because of  the high recurrence risk of the disease. Large multicenter screening programs with  uniform criteria would be worthwhile to determine the prevalence of Fragile-X mental  retardation in the Indian population.",

        "Abstract": "Pathogenic factors in a mentally retarded population were evaluated by comparing  their frequency among three groups of patients: a control group with predominantly  genetic retardation and consanguineous parents; a group with severe idiopathic  retardation and unrelated parents; and a group with mild idiopathic retardation and  unrelated parents. Seven factors were found to be significantly more common among  the patients with idiopathic retardation than in the genetic control group: a  history of maternal reproductive inefficiency; bleeding during pregnancy; toxemia  during pregnancy; signs of perinatal stress; neonatal anoxia; neonatal jaundice; and  seizures during the first year of life. A history of repeated maternal abortions was  particularly associated with mild retardation, and infantile seizures were  particularly associated with severe retardation. The latter association remained  significant even after exclusion of all infantile spasms, neonatal seizures and  symptomatic seizures. Since the control group in this study was composed mainly of  genetically retarded patients, the associations observed seem likely to be related  to the causes of retardation rather than simply being the effects of a damaged  fetus.",

        "Abstract": "Mental retardation and epilepsy often occur together. They are both heterogeneous  conditions with acquired and genetic causes. Where causes are primarily genetic,  major advances have been made in unraveling their molecular basis. The human X  chromosome alone is estimated to harbor more than 100 genes that, when mutated,  cause mental retardation. At least eight autosomal genes involved in idiopathic  epilepsy have been identified, and many more have been implicated in conditions  where epilepsy is a feature. We have identified mutations in an X chromosome-linked,  Aristaless-related, homeobox gene (ARX), in nine families with mental retardation  (syndromic and nonspecific), various forms of epilepsy, including infantile spasms  and myoclonic seizures, and dystonia. Two recurrent mutations, present in seven  families, result in expansion of polyalanine tracts of the ARX protein. These  probably cause protein aggregation, similar to other polyalanine and polyglutamine  disorders. In addition, we have identified a missense mutation within the ARX  homeodomain and a truncation mutation. Thus, it would seem that mutation of ARX is a  major contributor to X-linked mental retardation and epilepsy.",

        "Abstract": "Cases of nonspecific mental retardation (MR) born in British Columbia between 1952  and 1970 ascertained through the British Columbia Health Surveillance Registry were  linked by birth registration number to family sibships from computer-linked  groupings of birth and marriage records in British Columbia. It was possible to  retrieve family information for 97% of the cases by this method. Because of good  ascertainment and relatively large sample size, the 1952-1965 birth cohort  comprising 2,209 index cases was selected for calculations of overall risks and  recurrence risks to sibs categorized by sex, MR level, associated neurological  disability, and singleton versus multiple birth. The overall risk of affected  individuals among all sibs was 4.4 +/- 0.6%, which was about ten times greater than  the minimum population incidence of nonspecific MR. The risk among subsequent sibs  of the first affected case in a family was 3.7 +/- 0.8%. These risks varied  depending on sex, MR level, and whether the mental retardation was associated with  hydrocephalus, microcephalus, cerebral palsy, or epilepsy. The recurrence risk after  two affected individuals was 12 +/- 7%--about three times greater than after one  affected individual. Even though the frequency of MR is greater among twins than in  the overall population, the recurrence risk of nonspecific MR was not significantly  different for index cases from either singleton or multiple births.",

        "Title": "Ocular manifestations in the X-linked intellectual disability syndromes.",
        "Abstract": "Intellectual disability (ID), a common neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by  limitations of both intellectual functioning and adaptive behavior, affects an  estimated 1-2% of children. Genetic causes of ID are often accompanied by  recognizable syndromal patterns. The vision apparatus is a sensory extension of the  brain, and individuals with intellectual disabilities frequently have coexisting  abnormalities of ocular structures and the visual pathway system. About one-third of  the X-linked intellectual disability (XLID) syndromes have significant eye or ocular  adnexa abnormalities that provide important diagnostic clues. Some XLID syndromes  (e.g. Aicardi, cerebrooculogenital, Graham anophthalmia, Lenz, Lowe, MIDAS) are  widely known for their characteristic ocular manifestations. Nystagmus, optic  atrophy, and strabismus are among the more common, nonspecific, ocular  manifestations that contribute to neuro-ophthalmological morbidity. Common  dysmorphic oculofacial findings include anophthalmia, microphthalmia, hypertelorism,  and abnormalities in the configuration or orientation of the palpebral fissures.  Four XLID syndromes with major ocular manifestations (incontinentia pigmenti, Goltz,  MIDAS, and Aicardi syndromes) are notable because of male lethality and expression  occurring predominantly in females. The majority of the genes associated with XLID  and ocular manifestations have now been identified.",

        "Abstract": "Linkage analysis was performed in a family with non-specific X-linked mental  retardation (MRX 15). Hypotonia in infancy was the most remarkable physical  manifestation. The severity of mental deficiency was variable among the patients,  but all of them had poor or absent speech. Significant lod scores at a recombination  fraction of zero were detected with the marker loci DXS1126, DXS255, and DXS573  (Zmax = 2.01) and recombination was observed with the two flanking loci DXS164  (Xp21.1) and DXS988 (Xp11.22), identifying a 17 cM interval. This result suggests a  new gene localization in the proximal Xp region. In numerous families with  non-specific X-linked mental retardation (MRX), the corresponding gene has been  localized to the paracentromeric region in which a low recombination rate impairs  the precision of mapping.",

        "Abstract": "The X-chromosome breakpoint in a female patient with a balanced translocation  t(X;12)(q24;q15), bipolar affective disorder and mental retardation was mapped  within the glutamate receptor 3 (GRIA3) gene by fluorescence in situ hybridization.  The GRIA3 cDNA of 5894 bp was cloned, and the gene structure and pattern of  expression were determined. The most abundant GRIA3 transcript is composed of 17  exons. An additional 5 exons (2a, 2b, 5a, 5b, and 5c) from the 5' end of the GRIA3  open reading frame were identified by EST analysis (ESTs AI379066 and AA947914). Two  new polymorphic microsatellite repeats, (TC)(n=12-26) and (AC)(n=15-19), were  identified within GRIA3 5' and 3'UTRs. No mutations were detected in families  segregating disorders mapping across GRIA3, one with X-linked bipolar affective  disorder (BP) and one with a nonspecific X-linked mental retardation (MRX27). To  assess the possibility of the involvement of the GRIA3 gene in familial cases of  complex BP, a large set of 373 individuals from 40 pedigrees segregating BP were  genotyped using closely linked (DXS1001) and intragenic (DXS1212 and GRIA3 3' UTR  (AC)(n))) GRIA3 STR markers. No evidence of linkage was found by parametric Lod  score analysis (the highest Lod score was 0. 3 at DXS1212, using the dominant  transmission model) or by affected sib-pair analysis.",

        "Title": "[Psychiatric diagnostic problems of mentally retarded patients].",
        "Abstract": "Although the knowledge of psychiatric disorders appearing in course of mental  retardation is wider, there is still no straightforward data concerning their  frequency, symptomatology, and factors responsible for their appearance.  Symptomatology of disorders and psychiatric illnesses presented by mentally retarded  patients may differ from the one presented by healthy control. Nowadays it is  commonly considered that the same disorders and illnesses are diagnosed among  mentally retarded as well as among general population. THE AIM OF THE STUDY: To  analyze of psychopthologic symptoms observed during the admission of mentally  retarded patients to psychiatric hospital, to analyze comorbid psychiatric disorders  and stated diagnoses. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The medical documentation of patients  hospitalized in Babi\u0144ski's Hospital in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a (SPZOZ) in 2006 with diagnosis of mental  retardation (F70-F79 according to ICD-10). The patients hospitalized throughout the  year 2006 with comorbid psychiatric diagnosis as well as those with only stated  mental retardation were taken into account. The analysis was based on questionnaire  specially prepared for that paper. The results were statistically analyzed. RESULTS:  In mentally retarded patients admitted to psychiatric hospital behavior disorders  were the most frequently observed ones, subsequently psychosis and impulse control  disorders. Psychiatric disorder were mainly demonstrated by aggression and  psychomotor agitation. Psychiatric disorders at mentally retarded patients are  expressed by nonspecific syndromes, among which the most common are aggression, mood  lowering, psychomotor agitation, dysphoria, irritability. CONCLUSIONS: Nonspecific  syndromes, communication difficulties and low prevalence of standardized diagnostic  methods for mentally retarded patients are the reasons for still low number of  precise psychiatric stated diagnoses in comparison to the described syndromes and  disorders. This results in treating psychiatric syndromes as the consequence of  mental retardation itself, not as the consequence of present psychiatric disorder.",

        "Abstract": "Families with mentally retarded males found to be negative for FRAXA and FRAXE  mutations are useful in understanding the genetic basis of X-linked mental  retardation. According to the most recent data (updated to 1999), 69 MRX loci have  been mapped and 6 genes cloned. Here we report on a linkage study performed on 20  subjects from a 4-generation Sardinian family segregating a non-specific X-linked  recessive mental retardation (XLMR)(MRX72) associated with global delay of all  psychomotor development. Five of 8 affected males have been tested for mental age,  verbal and performance skills and behavioral anomalies; mental impairment ranged  from mild to severe. Only minor anomalies were present in the affected subjects.  Two-point linkage analysis based on 28 informative microsatellites spanning the  whole X chromosome demonstrated linkage between the disorder and markers DXS1073 and  F8c in Xq28 (maximum Lod score of 2. 71 at straight theta = 0.00). Multipoint  linkage analysis confirmed the linkage with a Z(max) of 3.0 at straight theta = 0.00  at DXS1073 and F8c. Recombination in an affected male at DXS1073 and F8c allowed us  to delimit centromerically and telomerically the region containing the putative  candidate gene. The region, where MRX72 maps, overlaps that of another MRX families  previously mapped to Xq28, two of which harbored mutations in GDI. Involvement of  this gene was excluded in our family, suggesting another MRX might reside in Xq28.",

Linkage analysis on 27 relatives using 18  polymorphic markers spanning the X-chromosome demonstrated close linkage to DXYS1  with a peak LOD score of 2.14 at a theta of 0. Numerous families with various types  of MRX have now been studied by other investigators using molecular genetic  techniques.

        "Abstract": "Non-specific mental retardation (NSMR) is a common human disorder characterized by  mental handicap as the only clinical symptom. Among the recently identified MR genes  is GDI1, which encodes alpha Gdi, one of the proteins controlling the activity of  the small GTPases of the Rab family in vesicle fusion and intracellular trafficking.  We report the cognitive and behavioral characterization of mice carrying a deletion  of Gdi1. The Gdi1-deficient mice are fertile and anatomically normal. They appear  normal also in many tasks to assess spatial and episodic memory and emotional  behavior. Gdi1-deficient mice are impaired in tasks requiring formation of  short-term temporal associations, suggesting a defect in short-term memory. In  addition, they show lowered aggression and altered social behavior. In mice, as in  humans, lack of Gdi1 spares most central nervous system functions and preferentially  impairs only a few forebrain functions required to form temporal associations. The  general similarity to human mental retardation is striking, and suggests that the  Gdi1 mutants may provide insights into the human defect and into the molecular  mechanisms important for development of cognitive functions.",

Patients with non-syndromal XLMR show no characteristic  manifestations, biochemical defects, or distinct fragile sites. Nevertheless,  nonspecific XLMR seems to be heterogeneous. To determine the number and location of  the genes responsible for XLMR, linkage studies in large pedigrees have to be  performed. Here we report the data of linkage analysis in a large Brazilian family  with 7 patients affected by a severe form of XLMR, with no other associated  malformations. All the obligate carriers are normal. A close linkage without  recombination (lod scores 1.95 and 3.25) was found between the disease locus and  polymorphic DNA loci DXS255 (Xp11.22), DXS14 (Xp11.21). These results suggest that  the gene responsible for the disease in this family maps in the Xp11-cent of the X  chromosome. Positive lod scores in this region have also been reported for other  XLMR genealogies, but with a much milder phenotype. The possibility of intragenic or  locus heterogeneity is discussed.",

Whereas the cytogenetic basis of  microdeletion syndromes has traditionally depended on the serendipitous  ascertainment of a patient with established clinical features and a chromosomal  rearrangement visible by G-banding, comparative genomic hybridization using  microarrays has enabled the identification of novel, recurrent imbalances in  patients with mental retardation and apparently nonspecific features. Compared with  the \"phenotype-first\" approach of traditional cytogenetics, array-based comparative  genomic hybridization has enabled the detection of novel genomic disorders using a  \"genotype-first\" approach. We report as an illustrative example the characterization  of a novel microdeletion syndrome of 1q41q42. METHODS: We tested more than 10,000  patients with developmental disabilities by array-based comparative genomic  hybridization using our targeted microarray. High-resolution microarray analysis was  performed using oligonucleotide microarrays for patients in whom deletions of  1q41q42 were identified. Fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed to confirm  all 1q deletions in the patients and to exclude deletions or other chromosomal  rearrangements in the parents. RESULTS: Seven cases were found with de novo  deletions of 1q41q42. The smallest region of overlap is 1.17 Mb and encompasses five  genes, including DISP1, a gene involved in the sonic hedgehog signaling pathway, the  deletion of which has been implicated in holoprosencephaly in mice. Although none of  these patients showed frank holoprosencephaly, many had other midline defects (cleft  palate, diaphragmatic hernia), seizures, and mental retardation or developmental  delay. Dysmorphic features are present in all patients at varying degrees. Some  patients showed more severe phenotypes and carry the clinical diagnosis of Fryns  syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: This new microdeletion syndrome with its variable clinical  presentation may be responsible for a proportion of Fryns syndrome patients and adds  to the increasing number of new syndromes identified with array-based comparative  genomic hybridization. The genotype-first approach to identifying recurrent  chromosome abnormalities is contrasted with the traditional phenotype-first  approach. Targeting developmental pathways in a functional approach to diagnostics  may lead to the identification of additional microdeletion syndromes.",

        "Title": "De Novo Variants in the DYNC1H1 Gene Associated With Infantile Spasms.",
        "Abstract": "Objective: The DYNC1H1 gene is related to a variety of diseases, including spinal  muscular atrophy with lower extremity-predominant 1, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease  type 2O, and mental retardation, autosomal dominant13 (MRD13). Some patients with  DYNC1H1 variant also had epilepsy. This study aimed to detect DYNC1H1 variants in  Chinese patients with infantile spasms (ISs). Methods: We reviewed clinical  information, video electroencephalogram (V-EEG), and neuroimaging of a newly  identified cohort of five patients with de novo DYNC1H1gene variants. Results: Five  patients with four DYNC1H1variants from four families were included. All patients  had epileptic spasms (ESs), the median age at seizure onset was 7.5 months (range  from 5 months to 2 years 7 months), and the interictal V-EEG results were  hypsarrhythmia. Four of five patients had brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)  abnormalities. Four de novo DYNC1H1 variants were identified, including two novel  variants (p.N1117K, p.M3405L) and two reported variants (p.R1962C, p.F1093S). As for  the variant site, two variants are located in the tail domain, one variant is  located in the motor domain, and one variant is located in the stalk domain. All  patients had tried more than five kinds of antiepileptic drugs. One patient has been  controlled well by vigabatrin (VGB) for 4 years, and another patient by VGB and  steroids for 1.5 years. The other three patients still had frequent ESs. All  patients had severe intellectual disability and development delays. Significance: IS  was one of the phenotypes of DYNC1H1 variants. Most patients had non-specific brain  MRI abnormality. Two of four DYNC1H1 variants were novel, expanding the variant  spectrum. The IS phenotype was related to the variant's domains of DYNC1H1 variant  sites. All patients were drug-refractory and showed development delays.",

        "Abstract": "B\u00f6rjeson-Forssman-Lehmann syndrome (BFLS) is a syndromic X-linked mental retardation  that has been mapped by linkage to Xq26-q27. A nonsyndromic mental retardation  family, MRX27, has also been localized to a region of the X chromosome overlapping  Xq26-q27. The gene for ARHGEF6 (also known as alphaPIX or Cool-2), a newly  identified guanine nucleotide exchange factor, was identified as a potential  candidate XLMR gene, due to its location within the BFLS and MRX27 critical regions  and its function in the regulation of PAK3 (a known MRX gene). The full coding  sequence and genomic structure of the gene for ARHGEF6 was established in silico,  based on available genomic, EST, and cDNA sequence information. Mutation analysis in  BFLS- and MRX27-affected individuals was carried out. No mutations were found in two  BFLS families or MRX27. Although ARHGEF6 is unlikely to be the gene responsible for  either BFLS or MRX27, it remains a prime candidate for nonspecific or syndromic  mental retardation linked to Xq26.",

        "Abstract": "Frailty is increasingly being recognized as a relevant health measure in older  populations, associated with an increased risk of adverse health outcomes and care  dependency. Because it is generally perceived that people with intellectual  disabilities are \"old\" from age 50 onwards, frailty research in this group might  lead to an understanding of factors, contributing to this perception. The  development since the 1990s of conceptual and operational definitions of frailty has  resulted in different approaches: biological (phenotype), multidimensional, and  non-specific deficit accumulation. All approaches consider disability a consequence  rather than a cause of frailty. This may be different for long-disabled populations,  which would have consequences for validity of frailty measures. First research shows  that the different approaches are applicable to study populations with intellectual  disabilities as well. Frailty as defined by both the phenotypic and deficit  accumulation approach appears to develop considerably earlier and is more severe in  people with intellectual disabilities than in the general older population,  supporting the notion of early aging. Before any clinical implications can be  outlined, health outcomes (validity), causes, and prevention of frailty should be  investigated.",

        "Abstract": "Rett syndrome is an increasingly recognized progressive disorder in females,  commencing in infancy and characterized by autistic behavior, gait ataxia,  stereotyped movements, seizures and generalized growth and mental retardation,  possibly associated with disorders of central biogenic amine synthesis. The gene  locus and pathogenesis of Rett syndrome are unknown. Autopsy studies in nine girls  dying between 4 and 17 years, and sural nerve and muscle biopsies from two girls  aged 3 and 17 years showed: (1) diffuse cortical atrophy/micrencephaly, with a  decrease in brain weight by 12% to 34% of age-matched controls, apparently related  to the duration of the disorder; (2) mild diffuse cortical atrophy with increased  amounts of neuronal lipofuscin and occasional mild gliosis, but without signs of a  storage disorder; (3) underpigmentation of the zona compacta nigrae, which showed  fewer well-pigmented neurons for age and fewer melanin granules per neuron, while  total numbers of nigral neurons and the substructure of neuromelanin were normal for  age. No pathological changes were seen in other transmitter-specific brain stem  nuclei; (4) immunoreactivity for tyrosine hydroxylase was slightly reduced in nigral  and hypothalamic neurons, and the pituitary gland showed decreased immunoreaction  for prolactin and growth hormone; (5) ultrastructurally, in frontal cortex and  caudate nucleus, isolated abnormal neurites and reactive or degenerative axonal  swellings were seen; the latter are possibly related to the nigral changes,  suggesting some dysfunction of the dopaminergic nigrostriatal system, which is  supported by neurochemical data; (6) preliminary biochemical studies revealed  increased beta-endorphines in thalamus and cerebellum; (7) peripheral nerves  demonstrated increase in small fibers without demyelination and increased numbers of  neurofilaments in axons, suggesting distal axonopathy, while skeletal muscle showed  alterations in the sarcoplasmic reticulum with circular profiles in the Z-filaments.  These nonspecific changes may be interpreted as early signs of denervation. The  variety of lesions in the central, neuroendocrine and peripheral neuromuscular  systems in Rett syndrome are discussed with regard to their clinical and biochemical  significance.",

        "Abstract": "Although genetic causes of X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) are heterogeneous and  complex, recent concerted actions between physicians and biologists have allowed  some major difficulties to be overcome and led to the identification of an  increasing number of genes involved in these conditions. Indeed, over the past 2  years significant progress has been made in understanding the molecular basis  underlying not only XLMR, where there are distinguishing phenotypic or genetic  markers (syndromal forms of XLMR), but also non-specific (or idiopathic) mental  retardation (MRX). Recent breakthroughs have shown that genes responsible for these  latter conditions encode for proteins involved in signalling pathways which regulate  cytoskeleton organization, synaptic vesicle transport and, maybe, other cellular  functions. Also, they suggest a provacative picture that conceptualizes MRX as  disorders resulting from a dysfunctioning of genes required for processes such as  the remodelling, establishment and stabilization of connections between neuronal  cells. Such processes are crucial for the development of intellectual and cognitive  functions. As these functions begin to evolve mainly in post-natal stages through  contact with diverse stimuli and environments, a potential therapeutic approach  would be the development of drugs that target cellular signalling pathways shown to  be implicated in MRX.",

        "Abstract": "Since the discovery of the FMR1 gene and the clinical and molecular characterization  of Fragile X Syndrome in 1991, more than 141 genes have been identified in the  X-chromosome in these 28\u2009years thanks to applying continuously evolving molecular  techniques to X-linked intellectual disability (XLID) families. In the past decade,  array comparative genomic hybridization and next generation sequencing technologies  have accelerated gene discovery exponentially. Classically, XLID has been subdivided  in syndromic intellectual disability (S-XLID)-where intellectual disability (ID) is  always associated with other recognizable physical and/or neurological features-and  non-specific or non-syndromic intellectual disability (NS-XLID) where the only  common feature is ID. Nevertheless, new advances on the study of these entities have  showed that this classification is not always clear-cut because distinct variants in  several of these XLID genes can result in S-XLID as well as in NS-XLID. This review  focuses on the current knowledge on the XLID genes involved in non-syndromic forms,  with the emphasis on their pathogenic mechanism, thus allowing the possibility to  elucidate why some of them can give both syndromic and non-syndromic phenotypes.",

All brain MRI examinations performed in children for varied  neurological and neurosurgical indications, especially children with non-specific  mental retardation and patients with cerebral malformation detected at initial  imaging work-up, were reviewed. Fissuration and lobulation anomalies (abnormal  orientation of fissures, pseudopolymicrogyria, cortical thickening, subcortical  cysts and heterotopia) were identified that we called cerebellar cortical dysplasia  (CCD). In order to better understand the origin of this malformation, current data  on cerebellar embryogenesis and histogenesis will be reviewed, and the pathological  and radiological features will be illustrated. Milder forms of CCD represent a  distinct group of anomalies that should be distinguished from other types of  cerebellar dysplasia (agenesis, hypoplasia or complex dysplasia with involvement of  the cerebellar vermis (rhombencephalosynapsis)) or combined cerebellar and cerebral  dysplasia (muscular dystrophies and lissencephaly). Recognition of cerebellar  cortical dysplasia could be a first step towards a broader understanding of its  pathogenesis and significance.",

        "Abstract": "Neuropathological findings are analyzed in 299 cases from 3 state institutions for  mental retardation (MR) with or without cerebral palsy or seizures. Major lesions  were found in 127 patients (42.5%): various forms of post-hypoxic encephalopathy,  developmental anomalies, degenerative and metabolic diseases and post-infectious  encephalopathy, all showing good clinicopathological correlations. Ninety-seven  patients (32.5%) showed minor or non-specific lesions which could not be used to  make a specific etiopathogenetic diagnosis and which appeared not concordant with  the magnitude of the functional deficiency but nevertheless demonstrated structural  imperfection of the brain. This group included subtle developmental anomalies, such  as focal heterotopia, polymicrogyria, abnormal convolutional patterns and  disproportionate subunits as in Down syndrome (45 cases; 15%) and subependymal  germinolysis in which the etiology is varied. The most baffling and elusive group  consisted of 75 cases (25%) showing no significant morphological abnormalities.  Thirty-six of these had a history of seizures but 39 did not. The causes of MR in  this group are heterogenous as in the group with major morphological lesions and may  include unrecognized biochemical abnormalities, ultrastructural lesions, psychiatric  disorders or cultural factors, but many still remain conjectural. It appears that a  morphologically normal brain provides a potential for but does not ensure average  functional development, but the reverse is not always true.",

Genetic defects underlying XLMR  are being identified at a rapid pace, often starting from X-chromosomal aberrations  and XLMR families with a well-defined linkage interval. Here, we present a new  family with a syndromic form of XLMR, including mild mental retardation, short  stature, microcephaly and hypogonadism. Two-point linkage analysis with 24  polymorphic markers spanning the entire X chromosome was carried out. We could  assign the causative gene to a 6 cM interval in Xp22.1-p21.3, with a maximum LOD  score of 2.61 for markers DXS989 and DXS1061 at theta = 0.00. No mutations were  found in the presented family for two known MRX genes mapping to this interval, ARX  and IL1RAPL-1. These data indicate that the interval Xp22.1-p21.3 contains at least  one additional MRXS gene.",

        "Abstract": "Disorders of cortical development form a spectrum of lesions produced by insults to  the developing neocortex. These conditions typically first manifest in childhood  with epilepsy, developmental delay, and focal neurologic signs. Although the  clinical and electrophysiologic findings are often nonspecific, high-resolution  magnetic resonance imaging facilitates diagnosis during life, and assists in  delineating specific clinical syndromes. While many patients are dysmorphic and  severely affected by mental retardation and epilepsy, some have normal or  near-normal cognitive function and no seizures. Molecular studies of dysplastic  cortex are providing new insights into the basic mechanisms of brain function and  development, while pathologic analysis of tissue removed at surgery is helping to  define epileptic circuitry. Treatment of the epilepsy associated with cortical  dysplasia is often frustrating, but surgical approaches based on accurately defining  epileptogenic regions are proving increasingly successful. Genetic diagnosis is  important for accurate counseling of families.",

        "Abstract": "Distal 1q21.1 microdeletions have shown highly variable clinical expressivity and  incomplete penetrance, with affected individuals manifesting a broad spectrum of  nonspecific features. The goals of this study were to better describe the phenotypic  spectrum of patients with distal 1q21.1 microdeletions and to compare the clinical  features among affected individuals. We performed a retrospective chart review of 47  individuals with distal 1q21.1 microdeletions tested at a large clinical genetic  testing laboratory, with most patients being clinically evaluated in the same  children's hospital. Health information such as growth charts, results of imaging  studies, developmental history, and progress notes were collected. Statistical  analysis was performed using Fisher's exact test to compare clinical features among  study subjects. Common features in our cohort include microcephaly (51.2%), seizures  (29.8%), developmental delay (74.5%), failure to thrive (FTT) (68.1%), dysmorphic  features (63.8%), and a variety of congenital anomalies such as cardiac  abnormalities (23.4%) and genitourinary abnormalities (19.1%). Compared to prior  literature, we found that seizures, brain anomalies, and FTT were more prevalent  among our study cohort. Females were more likely than males to have microcephaly (p  = 0.0199) and cardiac abnormalities (p = 0.0018). Based on existing genome-wide  clinical testing results, at least a quarter of the cohort had additional genetic  findings that may impact the phenotype of the individual. Our study represents the  largest cohort of distal 1q21.1 microdeletion carriers available in the literature  thus far, and it further illustrates the wide spectrum of clinical manifestations  among symptomatic individuals. These results may allow for improved genetic  counseling and management of affected individuals. Future studies may help to  elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms impacting the phenotypic variability  observed with this microdeletion.",

        "Title": "Prospective investigation of FOXP1 syndrome.",
        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Haploinsufficiency of the forkhead-box protein P1 (FOXP1) gene leads to  a neurodevelopmental disorder termed FOXP1 syndrome. Previous studies in individuals  carrying FOXP1 mutations and deletions have described the presence of autism  spectrum disorder (ASD) traits, intellectual disability, language impairment, and  psychiatric features. The goal of the present study was to comprehensively  characterize the genetic and clinical spectrum of FOXP1 syndrome. This is the first  study to prospectively examine the genotype-phenotype relationship in multiple  individuals with FOXP1 syndrome, using a battery of standardized clinical  assessments. METHODS: Genetic and clinical data was obtained and analyzed from nine  children and adolescents between the ages of 5-17 with mutations in FOXP1.  Phenotypic characterization included gold standard ASD testing and norm-referenced  measures of cognition, adaptive behavior, language, motor, and visual-motor  integration skills. In addition, psychiatric, medical, neurological, and  dysmorphology examinations were completed by a multidisciplinary team of clinicians.  A comprehensive review of reported cases was also performed. All missense and  in-frame mutations were mapped onto the three-dimensional structure of DNA-bound  FOXP1. RESULTS: We have identified nine de novo mutations, including three  frameshift, one nonsense, one mutation in an essential splice site resulting in  frameshift and insertion of a premature stop codon, three missense, and one in-frame  deletion. Reviewing prior literature, we found seven instances of recurrent  mutations and another 34 private mutations. The majority of pathogenic missense and  in-frame mutations, including all four missense mutations in our cohort, lie in the  DNA-binding domain. Through structural analyses, we show that the mutations perturb  amino acids necessary for binding to the DNA or interfere with the domain swapping  that mediates FOXP1 dimerization. Individuals with FOXP1 syndrome presented with  delays in early motor and language milestones, language impairment (expressive  language > receptive language), ASD symptoms, visual-motor integration deficits, and  complex psychiatric presentations characterized by anxiety, obsessive-compulsive  traits, attention deficits, and externalizing symptoms. Medical features included  non-specific structural brain abnormalities and dysmorphic features, endocrine and  gastrointestinal problems, sleep disturbances, and sinopulmonary infections.  CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies novel FOXP1 mutations associated with FOXP1  syndrome, identifies recurrent mutations, and demonstrates significant clustering of  missense mutations in the DNA-binding domain. Clinical findings confirm the role  FOXP1 plays in development across multiple domains of functioning. The genetic  findings can be incorporated into clinical genetics practice to improve accurate  genetic diagnosis of FOXP1 syndrome and the clinical findings can inform monitoring  and treatment of individuals with FOXP1 syndrome.",

        "Abstract": "Mental retardation is a life-long disability occurring in 2-3% of all children.  Genetic causes are very heterogeneous and the clinical presentation most often  non-specific. Current diagnostic tools can only identify a specific aetiology in  50-70%, and more importantly, often do not exclude a genetic cause in apparently  sporadic cases of mental retardation. A proven genetic aetiology has many  implications for the extended family. Fragile X syndrome is the most prevalent cause  of inherited mental retardation and occurs in 2-6% of both females and males.  Chromosomes and fragile X syndrome should be routinely investigated in patients with  mental retardation of unknown aetiology. Molecular cytogenetics (FISH) provide  specific diagnosis of several rare and clinically recognizable syndromes. Provision  of extended clinical information is critical at referral, so that the most relevant  investigations may be selected. Biochemical and molecular investigations can be  performed for an increasing number of distinct but all very rare conditions  associated with mental retardation. Efficient methods for simultaneous investigation  of a panorama of rare biochemical and molecular abnormalities are now available and  might improve the diagnostic yield considerably in the near future. We recommend a  long-term diagnostic follow-up which allows us to apply modern methods and diagnose  syndromes with phenotypes developing over several years.",

        "Title": "The clinical significance of fragile sites on human chromosomes.",
        "Abstract": "Fragile X syndrome is now a well established common clinical entity and most of  those who are aware of the condition probably know that it takes its name from a  rare fragile site (FRAXA) on the X chromosome. This is the best known fragile site  and its clinical significance is clear. Similar, but a little less known is FRAXE, a  fragile site close to that associated with fragile X syndrome, but in this case  associated with a mild form of non-specific X-linked mental retardation. These are  the only two fragile sites that are unequivocally of clinical significance. A  fragile site within the CBL2 oncogene on chromosome 11 has been mapped very close to  the deletion breakpoint in a handful of patients with Jacobsen syndrome. It is  doubtful that parents with FRA11B are at increased risk of having children with  Jacobsen syndrome, but this cannot be ruled out. The common fragile sites have been  implicated in oncogenesis since shortly after their discovery in the early 1980s.  While a couple of these are within genes that have been implicated in cancer it is  unclear whether either the fragile sites, or the genes in which they are located are  important in cancer. It may be that the common fragile sites are regions of genomic  instability and that this instability is increased in malignant cells, analogous to  the enhanced instability seen at microsatellite loci in a number of tumours. Since  we all have the common fragile sites there is no suggestion that they give anyone an  increased risk of developing malignant disease. In dealing with patients who are  found to have fragile sites, other than FRAXA, FRAXE and possibly FRA11B,  considerable reassurance can be given that they are not at increased risk of having  children with congenital disease or developing disease themselves because of their  fragile sites.",

Nine  articles, published in the PubMed, Scopus, Virtual Health Library and Web of Science  databases between 2002 and 2012, were selected. Based on the references of these  studies, 6 other articles were identified, totaling 15 studies in the review.  Forty-one federal laws produced between 2002 and 2012 were identified. The documents  were analyzed and categorized according to the main themes of socioeconomic  conditions, violence, mental health, ethics, health needs, health promotion and  prevention. From the scientific standpoint, non-specific discussions were observed  where intellectual disability was examined with other types of handicaps or  concomitantly with other Latin American countries. From the legal standpoint,  although laws related to health have been located, there is a lack of studies that  address the effectiveness and level of implementation of the proposed policies. The  increase in research in this area is a demand of the disabled population itself, and  will reveal their specific health needs, and will also support issues such as  prevention, promotion, diagnosis and treatment.",

        "Abstract": "X-linked non-specific mental retardation (MRX) is a heterogeneous condition in which  mental retardation (MR) appears to be the only consistent manifestation. The genetic  and phenotypic heterogeneity exclude any possibility of pooling families and,  therefore, of fine-mapping the related disease genes. In order to identify genomic  critical regions involved in the MRX condition assigned to Xp21.3-22.1 region, we  have implemented the PCR screening of non fragile X MR patients for the presence of  deletions in this region. The amplification by PCR of 12 markers located between  POLA and DXS704 using genomic DNA from 192 MR males led to the identification, in a  9 year old mentally retarded boy, of a microdeletion which extends from DXS1202 to  DXS1065. None of the known genes, POLA, MAGE genes cluster, DAX1, GK and DMD, that  map in the Xp21.3-22.1 region is affected by this deletion. This approach, which  could easily be applied to several other MRX loci, allowed not only a confirmation  of the presence of a potential locus in Xp21.3-22.1 involved in non-specific mental  retardation, but also a better definition of the genomic critical region  corresponding to this locus.",

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Recent technological advances have improved the understanding and  identification of the genetic basis of intellectual disability (ID) and global  developmental delay (GDD). Next-generation sequencing panels of ID genes are now  available for clinical testing; however, their overall yield in clinical practice  has not yet been investigated. AIM: We determined the diagnostic yield of ID gene  panels in a clinical setting and explored whether any clinical features are  associated with an increased diagnostic yield. METHODS: We performed a systematic  retrospective chart review of all patients with ID/GDD who underwent an ID gene  panel between April 2014 and July 2017 at our institution. Chi-square analysis  assessed whether any specific clinical features were significantly associated with a  positive diagnostic yield. RESULTS: Forty-eight subjects (18 females, 30 males;  median age: 7.5\u00a0years) were included. Consanguinity was present in 17%, autism in  38%, seizures in 42%, nonspecific dysmorphic features in 67%, and abnormalities on  neurological examination in 56%; furthermore, 29% of the cohort was nonverbal and 4%  was nonambulatory. Four different gene panels were used. The diagnostic yield was  21% (10/48) overall, and 38% with the more recent trio-based panel. Eight of 10  patients had de novo pathogenic dominant mutations, one had an inherited pathogenic  autosomal dominant mutation, and one had compound heterozygous pathogenic recessive  mutations. No clinical feature was significantly associated with an increased  diagnostic yield. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that ID gene panels have a high  yield and are a valuable diagnostic tool in the evaluation of children with ID/GDD.",

        "Title": "Epilepsy in patients with EAST syndrome caused by mutation in the KCNJ10.",
        "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: EAST syndrome comprises of epilepsy, ataxia, sensorineural deafness, and  tubulopathy. It is caused by a mutation in KCNJ10 gene. Less than thirty cases have  been reported in the literature with emphasis on genetic mutation and renal  tubulopathy. In this article, our goal is to present a comprehensive description of  epilepsy and its management. A literature review is also presented to consolidate  and compare our findings with the previously reported cases. METHODS: Retrospective  chart review was done to collect patient data. Research clinic was organized to  obtain missing data. Molecular genetic testing was done at the CGC Genetics  Laboratory. Electroencephalogram (EEG) was done for all patients and interpreted by  a pediatric epileptologist and brain MRI was reviewed by a pediatric  neuroradiologist. Developmental assessment was done by a developmental pediatrician  using Griffiths Mental Developmental Scale. RESULTS: In patients with EAST syndrome,  seizure is the first symptom occurring around 3-4\u202fmonths of age. Most common seizure  type was generalized tonic clonic (GTC). Usually, the seizures were brief lasting  <3\u202fmin but few patients also presented with status epilepticus especially when the  medication was weaned. Carbamazepine (CBZ) was found to be effective in most cases.  Lamotrigine (LTG), valproic acid (VPA), and topiramate (TPM) were also found to be  helpful. Routine EEGs were usually normal or showed non-specific findings. In few  patients, EEG showed background slowing. Brain MRI revealed hyperintensity in the  dentate nuclei in some patients, and quantitative volumetric analysis studies showed  volume loss in different regions of the brain especially the cerebellum. All our  five patients have the same homozygous c.170C>T (p.Thr57Ile) missense mutation in  KCNJ10 gene. CONCLUSION: This article provides the readers with an understanding of  the natural history of epilepsy in this syndrome to help in early recognition, avoid  unnecessary investigations, and provide the best treatment for seizures. It also  helps the physicians to share the prognosis of this rare syndrome with the parents.",

Two-point linkage  analysis demonstrated linkage between the disorder and several markers located at  Xq22.2, with maximum LOD score Z(max) = 2.41 at recombination fraction theta = 0 for  DXS1191 and DXS1230, respectively. Recombination events were observed with flanking  markers DXS8080 and DXS456, located at Xp11.3 and Xq22.3, respectively, and a region  of approximately 22.3 cM was defined. Accordingly, markers distal to Xp11.3 and  Xq22.3 segregated independently of the disease. The localized region observed in  this Chinese family overlaps with 29 other MRX loci previously reported in  Xp11.3-q22.3. These results should contribute to the identification of the disease  gene for the MRX84 disorder.",

Fragile X syndrome (FRAXA) was diagnosed in 16 residents, X-linked mental  retardation with marfanoid habitus (Lujan-Fryns syndrome) in 2, and non-specific  X-linked mental retardation (MRX) in 4 males. The 4 MRX-patients included 3 male  sibs of a family, carrying a mutation in the IL-1 receptor accessory protein-like  gene, and one male patient member of the MRX-44 family (linkage with LOD-score of  2.90). In the group of 215 males with idiopathic mental retardation (MR), family  histories and pedigree data were compatible with XLMR in 35 males (35/215 = 16.3 %)  from 32 families. Of these 35 males, 5.7 % were microcephalic with dysmorphic  features and 5.7 % macrocephalic; micro-orchidism and macro-orchidism were each  found in 11.4 %. One macrocephalic male had also macro-orchidism and dysmorphic  features. In this study, the diagnosis of XLMR could thus be proposed in 57 males  i.e. 13.1 % of the total male population. The clinical phenotype, behavioural  problems and follow-up data in these different subgroups of XLMR are presented.",

        "Abstract": "A new splice variant of the Rett syndrome gene, MECP2, was recently identified, that  includes coding sequence from exon 1, and is the predominant transcript in the  central nervous system. This sequence encodes polyalanine and polyglycine stretches  within the N-terminal portion of MeCP2, and may confer novel functional properties  to the protein. We screened autism, mental retardation (MR), and control populations  for sequence variation within this region, and identified variation in approximately  1% of MR cases screened (N = 1,410). No variants were identified in the autism  sample (N = 401). Most of these variants occur within a trinucleotide repeat region  and result in change in number of alanine or glycine residues within the repeat  stretches. We suggest some of these variants may be a relatively frequent cause of  non-specific MR or developmental delay.",

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Integrative research review infers generalizations about a substantive  subject, summarizes the accumulated knowledge that research has left unresolved and  generates a new framework on these issues. Due to methodological issues emerging  from working memory (WM) studies in the population with non-specific intellectual  disability (NSID) (N=64) between 1990-2014, it is difficult to conclude on WM  performance in this population. AIM: This integrative research review aimed to  resolve literature conflicts on WM performance among individuals with NSID and to  identify the conditions/moderators that govern their WM performance compared to  controls with Typical development. METHOD/PROCEDURE: We used the six stages of  integrative research review: problem formulation, data collection, evaluation, data  analysis, results, interpretation and discussion. OUTCOMES AND RESULTS: The findings  indicate two types of moderators that determine WM performance in the population  with NSID: Participants' moderators (criteria for matching the ID and TD groups, CA  and MA), and task moderators [the three WM components of Baddeley and Hitch's (1974)  model and task load]. Only an interaction between the two moderators determines WM  performance in this population. The findings indicate a hierarchy (from more to less  preserved) in WM performance of individuals with NSID: The visuospatial tasks, then  some of the executive functions tasks, and the phonological loop tasks being less  preserved. Furthermore, at a low level of control, the performance of participants  with NSID was preserved beyond the modality and vice versa. CONCLUSIONS AND  IMPLICATIONS: Modality and MA/intelligence determine WM performance of individuals  with ID. Educators should prepare intervention programs take the impact of the two  moderators into account.",

While early studies indicated that the cognitive phenotype  of NF1 resembles that of nonverbal learning disabilities (NLD), later research has  found that the impairments are broader and do not fit the NLD profile well.  Language-based deficits and executive dysfunction have also been found in empirical  studies. There is some evidence that neuropsychological impairment may be correlated  with the underlying central nervous system involvement of NF1, but this theory has  not been consistently supported across studies. Further work clarifying the  cognitive phenotype of NF1 is needed, especially investigations that employ  appropriate comparison groups matched for intellectual level. Am. J. Med. Genet.  (Semin.

        "Abstract": "Extensive linkage analyses in three families with non-specific X-linked mental  retardation (MRX) have localized the gene in each family to the pericentromeric  region of the chromosome. The MRX17 gene is localized with a peak lod of 2.41 (theta  = 0.0) with the trinucleotide repeat polymorphism at the androgen receptor (AR) gene  locus. This gene lies in the interval between the markers DXS255 and DXS990, as  defined by recombinants. The MRX18 gene maps to the interval between the markers  DXS538 and DXS1126, with a peak lod score of 2.01 (theta = 0.0) at the PFC gene  locus. In the third family (Family E) with insufficient informative meioses for  assignment of an MRX acronym, the maximum lod score is 1.8 at a recombination  fraction of zero for several marker loci between DXS207 and DXS426. Exclusions from  the regions of marker loci spanning Xq support the localization of the MRX gene in  Family E to the pericentromeric region. Localizations of these and other MRX genes  have determined that MRX2 and MRX19 map to distal Xp, MRX3, and MRX6 map to distal  Xq, whilst the majority cluster in the pericentromeric region. In addition, we  confirm that there are at least two distinct MRX genes near the centromere as  delineated by the non-overlapping regional localizations of MRX17 and MRX18.  Determination of these non-overlapping localizations is currently the only means of  classifying non-syndromal forms of mental retardation and determining the minimum  number of MRX loci.",

        "Abstract": "X-linked forms of mental retardation (XLMR) include a variety of different disorders  and may account for up to 25% of all inherited cases of mental retardation. So far,  seven X-chromosomal genes mutated in nonspecific mental retardation (MRX) have been  identified: FMR2, GDI1, RPS6KA3, IL1RAPL, TM4SF2, OPHN1 and PAK3 (refs 2-9). The  products of the latter two have been implicated in regulation of neural plasticity  by controlling the activity of small GTPases of the Rho family. Here we report the  identification of a new MRX gene, ARHGEF6 (also known as alphaPIX or Cool-2),  encoding a protein with homology to guanine nucleotide exchange factors for Rho  GTPases (Rho GEF). Molecular analysis of a reciprocal X/21 translocation in a male  with mental retardation showed that this gene in Xq26 was disrupted by the  rearrangement. Mutation screening of 119 patients with nonspecific mental  retardation revealed a mutation in the first intron of ARHGEF6 (IVS1-11T-->C) in all  affected males in a large Dutch family. The mutation resulted in preferential  skipping of exon 2, predicting a protein lacking 28 amino acids. ARHGEF6 is the  eighth MRX gene identified so far and the third such gene to encode a protein that  interacts with Rho GTPases.",

Recently,  there was an explosion of information regarding the role of the central nervous  system (CNS) in the development of monogenic and syndromic obesity. Case  presentation Over the last decade, terminal and interstitial submicroscopic  deletions of copy number variants (CNVs) in 2p25.3 and single nucleotide variants  (SNVs) in myelin transcription factor 1 like (MYT1L) were detected by genome-wide  array analysis and whole exome sequencing (WES) in patients with a nonspecific  clinical phenotype that commonly includes intellectual disability (ID), early onset  of obesity and speech delay. Here, we report the first Saudi female patient with  mild to moderate ID, early onset of obesity and speech delay associated with a de  novo pathogenic SNV in the MYT1L gene (c. 1585G>A [Gly529Arg]), which causes an  amino acid change from Gly to Arg at position 529 that leads to mental retardation,  autosomal dominant 39.",

        "Abstract": "IL1RAPL1 (interleukin-1 receptor accessory protein-like 1) located at Xp21.3-22.1  has repeatedly been shown to be deleted in patients with a contiguous gene syndrome  also affecting neighboring genes, in particular DMD (dystrophin), DAX-1 (NR0B1,  nuclear receptor subfamily 0, group B, member 1), and GK (glycerol kinase). In  contrast, intragenic deletions of IL1RAPL1 or other mutations or cytogenetic  aberrations affecting IL1RAPL1 have only rarely been identified. Up to date, they  have mostly been associated with nonspecific mental retardation (MRX). We report on  two nonrelated patients with MR and additional dysmorphic features who both show  intragenic deletions of IL1RAPL1, one of them being de novo (exon 2) and the other  one being inherited from his mother (exons 3-5). Deletions were identified by  microarray-based chromosome analysis and confirmed by multiplex PCR and FISH,  respectively. These data, along with recent functional studies indicating its role  in neuronal development, provide further evidence for the relevance of IL1RAPL1 in  the pathogenesis of X-linked MR and add knowledge to the phenotypic spectrum of  IL1RAPL1 mutations.",

AIMS: The objectives of the present study were to examine  attachment among school-age children with ID and whether attachment varies according  to level of intellectual functioning, adaptative functioning, and presence of a  genetic syndrome (i.e. Down syndrome). METHODS: Attachment among 54 children with ID  aged 8-12 years (30 with Down Syndrome, 24 with non-specific ID) was assessed using  the Attachment Story Completion Task, and compared with that of 108 typically  developing children, 54 of the same chronological age and 54 of the same mental age.  OUTCOMES: Results show (1) less security among children with ID than among same-age  controls (2) more disorganization among children with ID compared to the two control  groups, (3) a link between attachment disorganization and level of adaptive  functioning among children with ID and (4) no difference in attachment between  children with DS and children with non-specific ID. CONCLUSIONS: Children with ID  remain vulnerable to disorganization during late childhood. More research is needed  to understand the factors underlying disorganized attachment representations.",

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mental retardation is one of the most frequent major handicap, with a  1-3 % frequency in the general population. The recent progress of molecular biology  and cytogenetic allowed to identify new genes for non syndromic autosomal recessive  mental retardation. AIM: To seek a genetic linkage to the loci implied in the  nonspecific mental retardation transmitted into autosomal recessive (ARNSMR) in  Algerian families with several affected members and to make the Genetic analysis of  ARNSMR for 4 known loci: 3p25-pter; 4q24- q25, 19p13.12 and 1p21.1-p13. METHODS: The  study concerned 34 individuals including 15 patients, belonging to six  consanguineous Algerian families. Genotyping was made using polymorphic  microsatellite markers and the analysis carried out thanks to the program Gene  Mapper software. Statistical analyses were validated using the Fast Link programme  of the Easy linkage software (V4:00 betas). RESULTS: The study carried out made it  possible to exclude linkage of all loci for 3 families, nevertheless the linkage of  one family to the locus 1p21.1-p13.3 remains possible. CONCLUSION: The absence of  linkage of 4 Algerian families with autosomal recessive mental retardation to 3 well  known loci, confirms the genetic heterogeneity of mental retardation. We have to  pursue research of candidate genes by whole genome scan.",

        "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: FRAXE mental retardation, a recently identified rare genetic condition,  is due to a mutation of the FMR2 gene, located at Xq28 region. The phenotype is  non-specific and characterized by developmental delay, speech, reading and writing  problems, poor adaptive skills, anxiety, aggressiveness, obsessive-compulsive  disturbance, and hyperactivity. The objective of this study was to describe the  characteristic EEG pattern found in one patient with FRAXE mental retardation.  METHODS: EEG (with photic stimulation and hand/foot tapping) and median nerve  somatosensory evoked potentials were recorded in a 8-year-old male patient with  FRAXE mental retardation (diagnosis confirmed by molecular genetic analysis) and  speech disturbances. RESULTS: The patient never presented seizures; however, sleep  enhanced multifocal spikes were found in the EEG. Moreover, tactile stimulation of  hands and feet, as well as intermittent photic stimulation, provoked the appearance  of spikes. Somatosensory evoked potentials from the median nerves showed a 'giant'  component at around 60 ms. CONCLUSIONS: Considering the rarity of both FRAXE mental  retardation and tactile evoked spikes, their association in the same subject might  be considered as not casual. If confirmed by future studies, these  neurophysiological findings might be considered as a marker for FRAXE mental  retardation.",

Since macro-orchidism was a variable feature among the otherwise identically  affected males in one family, we question the existence of a separate entity of  X-linked mental retardation characterized only be testicular enlargement. The X  chromosome marker of Lubs was expressed, under the culture conditions of Sutherland,  in lymphocytes of the affected males of two families, one with and the other without  megalotestes. Two affected members of the third family, with megalotestes, did not  show the marker. Telomeric structural changes similar to the mar(X) (qter) formation  were found on certain autosomes, notably, chromosome 6 in some of the affected  males, potential and obligate carrier females, and in both related and unrelated  normal males. These autosomal markers appear to represent a nonspecific response to  either in vivo or in vitro folate deficiency. Caution against premature introduction  of this test for prenatal diagnosis, in the face of current ignorance regarding  diagnostic specificity, is urged.",

Students responded to two well  validated instruments, The Fear Survey Schedule for Children-Revised and Revised  Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale. The results revealed age, gender, and disability  interaction effects. Adolescent boys having mild mental retardation reported highest  levels of fear related to failure and criticism, a finding that was different from  those reported in previous studies. In addition, girls reported higher levels than  boys of total fear, fears related to minor injury and small animals, and  worry/oversensitivity. Age main effects were also observed where younger students  from both the LD and the MIMR groups reported higher levels of non-specific general  anxiety. Implications and directions for future research were presented.",

        "Abstract": "Mental retardation (MR) is one of the most common human disorders. MR may be just  one of the clinical signs of a complex syndrome or it may be associated with  metabolic disorders or with disorders of brain development, but in many patients  [nonspecific MR (NSMR)], it is the only consistent clinical manifestation. It is  expected that NSMR is caused by alterations in molecular pathways important for  cognitive functions. Insights into NSMR have recently come from the study of  X-linked MR as eight genes were identified during the last few years. This  development has represented a fundamental breakthrough in our understanding of NSMR  and of cognitive functions and has opened new perspectives in the study of MR. The  new genes identified are a heterogeneous group, but it is very intriguing that they  are all directly or indirectly involved in signaling pathways and that the majority  are proteins that regulate members of the Ras superfamily of small GTP binding  proteins.",

In this study, we report a 10-year-old  boy with a de novo novel pathogenic variant in YY1, the first Iranian patient with  Gabriele-de Vries Syndrome. METHODS: The novel de novo pathogenic variant detected  in this study (NM_003403:c.690delA, p.Glu231Ilefs*25) was identified by whole-exome  sequencing and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. RESULTS: The proband presented with  delayed motor and speech development, ataxia, abnormal gait, autistic behavior,  brain atrophy, and severe learning disability. Finally, we provide a case-based  review of the clinical features associated with Gabriele-de Vries Syndrome. Thus  far, merely 13 Gabriele-de Vries Syndrome patients have been reported in the  literature. CONCLUSION: The investigations for a suspected case of Gabriele-de Vries  Syndrome must involve molecular diagnosis of the disease and its underlying genetic  defect because the clinical investigations are generally variable and nonspecific.",

Metabolic urine screening revealed elevations in all metabolites, expressed as  millimoles per mole of creatinine, which suggests decreased creatinine excretion.

        "Abstract": "CGG repeat expansions in the 5' noncoding region of the fragile X mental retardation  1 gene (FMR1) give rise to both neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative human  diseases depending on the length of the expansion. Expansions beyond 200 repeats  (full mutation) generally result in gene silencing and fragile X syndrome (FXS), the  leading heritable form of cognitive impairment and autism. Smaller expansions  (55-200 CGG repeats; \"premutation\") give rise to the neurodegenerative disorder  fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) through an entirely distinct,  toxic mRNA gain-of-function mechanism. A rapid means for both high-risk and newborn  screening for allele size would provide a greater opportunity for early intervention  and family counseling as well as furnish critical data on repeat size distribution  and expanded allele frequencies. In the current work, we propose a novel mass  spectrometry (MS) based method for the rapid identification of expanded CGG repeats  to complement a recently described polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method for large  population screening. In this combined approach, the optimized PCR method is used to  amplify the relevant region of FMR1, followed by extensive nonspecific nuclease  digestion. The resulting oligonucleotides are analyzed by MS in a manner that  provides the relative proportion of triplet repeat oligonucleotides in seconds per  sample. This assay enables swift and reproducible detection of expanded CGG alleles  using a single blood spot and in principle is suitable for large scale studies and  newborn screening. Moreover, this analytical scheme establishes a unique new  intersection of MS with molecular biology, with potential for significant  interdisciplinary impact.",

Cytogenetic and  molecular studies were performed in this boy and his parents with normal phenotype,  showing that the boy had a maternally derived approximately 2 Mb interstitial Xp  deletion involving DAX1 (DSS-AHC critical region on the X chromosome, gene 1) for  adrenal hypoplasia congenita and disrupting IL1RAPL (interleukin-1 receptor  accessory protein-like) for non-specific MR.

        "Abstract": "Oculofaciocardiodental (OFCD) and Lenz microphthalmia syndromes form part of a  spectrum of X-linked microphthalmia disorders characterized by ocular, dental,  cardiac and skeletal anomalies and mental retardation. The two syndromes are  allelic, caused by mutations in the BCL-6 corepressor gene (BCOR). To extend the  series of phenotypes associated with pathogenic mutations in BCOR, we sequenced the  BCOR gene in patients with (1) OFCD syndrome, (2) putative X-linked ('Lenz')  microphthalmia syndrome, (3) isolated ocular defects and (4) laterality phenotypes.  We present a new cohort of females with OFCD syndrome and null mutations in BCOR,  supporting the hypothesis that BCOR is the sole molecular cause of this syndrome. We  identify for the first time mosaic BCOR mutations in two females with OFCD syndrome  and one apparently asymptomatic female. We present a female diagnosed with isolated  ocular defects and identify minor features of OFCD syndrome, suggesting that OFCD  syndrome may be mild and underdiagnosed. We have sequenced a cohort of males  diagnosed with putative X-linked microphthalmia and found a mutation, p.P85L, in a  single case, suggesting that BCOR mutations are not a major cause of X-linked  microphthalmia in males. The absence of BCOR mutations in a panel of patients with  non-specific laterality defects suggests that mutations in BCOR are not a major  cause of isolated heart and laterality defects. Phenotypic analysis of OFCD and Lenz  microphthalmia syndromes shows that in addition to the standard diagnostic criteria  of congenital cataract, microphthalmia and radiculomegaly, patients should be  examined for skeletal defects, particularly radioulnar synostosis, and  cardiac/laterality defects.",

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Most studies of empathy have focused on young children, and those who  are typically developing. Thus, we know little about the emergence and manifestation  of empathy in non-normally developing children. METHOD: Empathy and response to  distress in others were examined in 30 children with Down syndrome, 22 children with  nonspecific etiologies of mental retardation, and 22 typically developing children.  RESULTS: Results indicated that compared to the other children, children with Down  syndrome responded to distress in others by looking to them more, and offering more  comfort in the form of prosocial responses. However, in a hypothetical empathy  situation, children with Down syndrome were less likely to feel the same emotion as  the protagonist than were the typical children. Children with Down syndrome differed  from the children with nonspecific mental retardation only in their response to  distress in others. The children with nonspecific mental retardation were more  similar to than different from the MA-matched typical children. CONCLUSIONS: These  results suggest some etiology-associated differences in empathy and response to  distress in children with mental retardation.",

        "Title": "MECP2 is highly mutated in X-linked mental retardation.",
        "Abstract": "Following the recent discovery that the methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MECP2) gene  located on Xq28 is involved in Rett syndrome (RTT), a wild spectrum of phenotypes,  including mental handicap, has been shown to be associated with mutations in MECP2.  These findings, with the compelling genetic evidence suggesting the presence in Xq28  of additional genes besides RabGDI1 and FMR2 involved in non-specific X-linked  mental retardation (MRX), prompted us to investigate MECP2 in MRX families. Two  novel mutations, not found in RTT, were identified. The first mutation, an E137G,  was identified in the MRX16 family, and the second, R167W, was identified in a new  mental retardation (MR) family shown to be linked to Xq28. In view of these data, we  screened MECP2 in a cohort of 185 patients found negative for the expansions across  the FRAXA CGG repeat and reported the identification of mutations in four sporadic  cases of MR. One of the mutations, A140V, which we found in two patients, has been  described previously, whereas the two others, P399L and R453Q, are novel mutations.  In addition to the results demonstrating the involvement of MECP2 in MRX, this study  shows that the frequency of mutations in MECP2 in the mentally retarded population  screened for the fragile X syndrome is comparable to the frequency of the CGG  expansions in FMR1. Therefore, implementation of systematic screening of MECP2 in MR  patients should result in significant progress in the field of molecular diagnosis  and genetic counseling of mental handicap.",

Clinical and DNA studies were conducted on 17 relatives, including 6 males  with mild-to-moderate mental retardation, 3 carrier females, and 8 normal males. In  contrast to the normal appearance and minimal clinical findings reported 22 years  ago, affected males were found to have a characteristic set of clinical findings.  These developed gradually over the first 2 decades, and included thin body build  with diminished muscle mass, osteoporosis and kyphoscoliosis, slight facial  asymmetry with a prominent lower lip, nasal speech, high narrow or cleft plate, and  long great toes. Carrier females were clinically normal. Multipoint linkage analysis  indicated linkage to markers distal to the 3' end of DMD (DXS41 and DXS989), with a  maximal lod score of 4.7. On the basis of these findings, this entity is redefined  as XLMR syndrome.",

        "Title": "A novel ribosomal S6-kinase (RSK4; RPS6KA6) is commonly deleted in patients with  complex X-linked mental retardation.",
        "Abstract": "Large deletions in Xq21 often are associated with contiguous gene syndromes  consisting of X-linked deafness type 3 (DFN3), mental retardation (MRX), and  choroideremia (CHM). The identification of deletions associated with classic CHM or  DFN3 facilitated the positional cloning of the underlying genes, REP-1 and POU3F4,  respectively, and enabled the positioning of the MRX gene in between these genes.  Here, we report the cloning and characterization of a novel gene, ribosomal  S6-kinase 4 (RSK4; HGMW-approved symbol RPS6KA6), which maps in the MRX critical  region. RSK4 is completely deleted in eight patients with the contiguous gene  syndrome including MRX, partially deleted in a patient with DFN3 and present in  patients with an Xq21 deletion and normal intellectual abilities. RSK4 is most  abundantly expressed in brain and kidney. The predicted protein of 746 amino acids  shows a high level of homology to three previously isolated members of the human RSK  family. RSK2 is involved in Coffin-Lowry syndrome and nonspecific MRX. The  localization of RSK4 in the interval that is commonly deleted in mentally retarded  males together with the high degree of amino acid identity with RSK2 suggests that  RSK4 plays a role in normal neuronal development. Further mutation analyses in males  with X-linked mental retardation must prove that RSK4 is indeed a novel MRX gene.",

In this study, 40 patients with non-specific  X linked mental retardation were analysed with full coverage, X chromosomal,  bacterial artificial chromosome arrays. Copy number changes were validated by  multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification as a fast method to detect  duplications and deletions in patient and control DNA. This approach has the  capacity to detect copy number changes as small as 100 kb. We identified three  causative duplications: one family with a 7 Mb duplication in Xp22.2 and two  families with a 500 kb duplication in Xq28 encompassing the MECP2 gene. In addition,  we detected four regions with copy number changes that were frequently identified in  our group of patients and therefore most likely represent genomic polymorphisms.  These results confirm the power of array CGH as a diagnostic tool, but also  emphasise the necessity to perform proper validation experiments by an independent  technique.",

        "Abstract": "Our study describes the adult clinical and biochemical spectrum of guanidinoacetate  methyltransferase (GAMT) deficiency, a recently discovered inborn error of  metabolism. The majority of the previous reports dealt with pediatric patients, in  contrast to the present study. A total of 180 institutionalized patients with a  severe mental handicap were investigated for urine and plasma uric acid and  creatinine. Patients with an increased urinary uric acid/creatinine ratio and/or  decreased creatinine were subjected to the analysis of guanidinoacetate (GAA). Four  patients (three related and one from an unrelated family) were identified with  GAMT-deficiency. A fifth patient had died before a biochemical diagnosis could be  made. They all had shown a normal psychomotor development for the first year of  life, after which they developed a profound mental retardation. Three out of four  had convulsions and all four totally lacked the development of speech. Their GAMT  activity in lymphoblasts was impaired and two novel mutations were identified: the  59 G > C and 506 G > A missense mutations. Urinary GAA was increased, but highly  variable 347-1,624 mmol/mol creat (Controls <150 mmol/mol creat). In plasma and CSF  the GAA levels were fairly constant at 17.3-27.0 mumol/L (Controls 1.33-3.33) and  11.0-12.4 mumol/L, respectively (Controls 0.068-0.114). GAMT deficiency in adults is  associated with severe mental retardation and absence or limited speech development.  Convulsions may be prominent. The nonspecific nature of the clinical findings as  well as the limited availability of GAA assays and/or in vivo magnetic resonance  spectroscopy of the brain may mean that many more patients remain undiagnosed in  institutions for persons with mental handicaps.",

        "Abstract": "Primary or nonspecific X-linked mental retardation (MRX) is a heterogeneous  condition in which affected patients do not have any distinctive clinical or  biochemical features in common apart from cognitive impairment. Although it is  present in approximately 0.15-0.3% of males, most of the genetic defects associated  with MRX, which may involve more than ten different genes, remain unknown. Here we  report the characterization of a new gene on the long arm of the X-chromosome  (position Xq12) and the identification in unrelated individuals of different  mutations that are predicted to cause a loss of function. This gene is highly  expressed in fetal brain and encodes a protein of relative molecular mass 91K, named  oligophrenin-1, which contains a domain typical of a Rho-GTPase-activating protein  (rhoGAP). By enhancing their GTPase activity, GAP proteins inactivate small Rho and  Ras proteins, so inactivation of rhoGAP proteins might cause constitutive activation  of their GTPase targets. Such activation is known to affect cell migration and  outgrowth of axons and dendrites in vivo. Our results demonstrate an association  between cognitive impairment and a defect in a signalling pathway that depends on a  Ras-like GTPase.",

Most of the STS deleted patients have X-linked ichthyosis  as the only clinical feature and it is believed that patients with more complex  disorders including mental retardation could be present as a result of contiguous  gene deletion. In fact, VCX3A gene, a member of the VCX (variable charge, X  chromosome) gene family, was previously proposed as the candidate gene for X-linked  non-specific mental retardation in patients with X-linked ichthyosis. We report on a  boy with familial ichthyosis, dysmorphic features and moderate mental retardation  with approximately 2 Mb interstitial deletion on Xp22.3 involving VCX3A and STS  genes.",

These include OPHN1, GDI1,  PAK3, IL1RAPL, TM4SF2, FMR2 and RSK2. To investigate the mechanisms through which  alterations of these gene products could result in cognitive impairment, we analyzed  their expression using quantitative PCR technique in two in vitro models of  activity-dependent gene regulation: kainate-induced seizures and long-term synaptic  potentiation (LTP). We found that the level of expression of four genes, PAK3,  IL1RAPL, RSK2 and TM4SF2, was significantly up-regulated following kainate  treatment. Furthermore we observed a significant increase in mRNA levels of PAK3 and  IL1RAPL following LTP induction.

        "Abstract": "The prevalence of psychiatric disorders is increased in children and adults with  intellectual disability. Brain damage or dysfunction interact with social and family  factors to increase susceptibility to mental illness. Psychiatric disorders in the  context of genetic syndromes are commonly overlooked, and there is substantial  underdiagnosis of mental disorders because of the atypical and non-specific clinical  presentations, and the frequent assumption that psychiatric symptoms are an inherent  part of the underlying intellectual disability. There is a strong need for  evidence-based practice in the prescribing and monitoring of drugs in this  population, especially since many of the drugs are unlicensed for use in children.  There is an urgent need to understand and establish the pharmacokinetics,  pharmacodynamics, and side-effect profiles of psychotropic medication in this  population. Positive trends in pharmacotherapy include the use of atypical  antipsychotics instead of the classic antipsychotics, serotonin-specific reuptake  inhibitors (SSRIs) rather than tricyclic antidepressants, and newer antiepileptic  drugs. Another welcome trend is the use of SSRIs instead of antipsychotics in the  long-term management of challenging behaviour in this population.",

        "Title": "Is MED13L-related intellectual disability a recognizable syndrome?",
        "Abstract": "INTRODUCTION: MED13L-related intellectual disability is characterized by moderate  intellectual disability (ID), speech impairment, and dysmorphic facial features. We  present 8 patients with MED13L-related intellectual disability and review the  literature for phenotypical and genetic aspects of previously described patients.  MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the search for genetic aberrations in individuals with ID,  two of the patients were identified by chromosomal microarray analysis, and five by  exome sequencing. One of the individuals, suspected of MED13L-related intellectual  disability, based on clinical features, was identified by Sanger sequencing.  RESULTS: All 8 individuals had de novo MED13L aberrations, including two intragenic  microdeletions, two frameshift, three nonsense variants, and one missense variant.  Phenotypically, they all had intellectual disability, speech and motor delay, and  features of the mouth (open mouth appearance, macroglossia, and/or macrostomia). Two  individuals were diagnosed with autism, and one had autistic features. One had  complex congenital heart defect, and one had persistent foramen ovale. The  literature was reviewed with respect to clinical and dysmorphic features, and  genetic aberrations. CONCLUSIONS: Even if most clinical features of MED13L-related  intellectual disability are rather non-specific, the syndrome may be suspected in  some individuals based on the association of developmental delay, speech impairment,  bulbous nasal tip, and macroglossia, macrostomia, or open mouth appearance.",

        "Abstract": "Muscle biopsies from three patients with cardiomyopathy, mental retardation and  increased serum creatine kinase levels revealed scattered fibers with tiny  intracytoplasmic vacuoles containing basophilic and acid phosphatase-positive  material and slightly increased amounts of PAS-positive granules. These findings are  consistent with those seen in the so-called lysosomal glycogen storage disease with  normal acid maltase. In addition to the vacuoles, there were occasional folds or  indentations in the sarcolemma which were connected to the membrane enclosing the  vacuoles. These membranes were well demonstrated histochemically by the nonspecific  esterase and acetylcholinesterase stains. On electron microscopy, most of the  vacuoles were bounded by membranes with basal lamina. The vacuolar membrane stained  positively with antibodies raised to dystrophin, dystrophin-associated  glycoproteins, laminin and type 4 collagen, and it was identical to the sarcolemma  and its basal lamina. Therefore, the membrane abnormality which causes sarcolemmal  folding is probably critical to understanding the pathomechanism of this disease.",

        "Title": "Clinical and behavioral characteristics in FG syndrome.",
        "Abstract": "FG syndrome is a rare X-linked recessive form of mental retardation, first described  by Opitz and Kaveggia in 1974. Based on over 50 reported cases, FG syndrome is  associated with agenesis of the corpus callosum, minor facial anomalies (high, broad  forehead with frontal cowlick, ocular hypertelorism, down-slanted palpebral  fissures, and small cupped auricles), relative macrocephaly, broad thumbs and  halluces, and prominent fetal fingertip pads. Affected individuals manifest neonatal  hypotonia and severe constipation, which usually resolves during mid-childhood. The  hypotonia with joint hyperlaxity evolves into spasticity with joint contractures in  later life. Affability, hyperactivity, and excessive talkativeness are noted  frequently in patients with FG syndrome. Recently, we described three additional  families (six additional patients) with FG syndrome who support the localization of  a gene for the FG syndrome in chromosome region Xq12-q21 [Graham JM Jr, Tackels D,  Dibbern K, Superneau D, Rodgers C, Corning K, Schwartz CE. 1998. Am J Med Genet  80:145-156.]. Using these same families and one additional sporadic case of FG  syndrome, we compared behavioral and personality characteristics of 6 FG boys with  other boys with syndromic and nonsyndromic mental retardation: eight with Down  syndrome, seven with Prader-Willi syndrome, eight with nonspecific mental  retardation, and 13 with Williams syndrome. Using the Vineland Adaptive Behavior  Scales, the Reiss Personality Profiles, and the Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist,  parents were asked to characterize the behavior and personality of their boys from  ages 4 to 10 years. When compared with Williams syndrome, the FG boys had fewer  internalizing behaviors and were significantly less anxious and withdrawn but had  similar socially oriented, attention-seeking behaviors. On the Reiss Profile, FG  boys were also quite similar to Williams syndrome boys. On the Vineland Scales, FG  boys demonstrated significant relative strengths in their socialization skills,  consistent with their personality, tending to confirm previous descriptions of their  personalities.",

        "Title": "Clinically relevant single gene or intragenic deletions encompassing critical  neurodevelopmental genes in patients with developmental delay, mental retardation,  and/or autism spectrum disorders.",
        "Abstract": "Recent studies suggest that copy number variations (CNVs) encompassing several genes  involved in neurodevelopmental pathways are associated with a variety of  neuropsychiatric phenotypes, including developmental delay (DD), mental retardation  (MR), and autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Here we present eight patients in a  cohort of approximately 1,200 patients referred for clinical array CGH testing for  various neurodevelopmental phenotypes,whowere identified to carry small (<1.0Mb with  the majority <500 kb) either total gene or intragenic deletions encompassing  critical synaptic and other neurodevelopmental genes. The presentations of these  patients included variable degrees of DD, speech problems, learning disabilities,  MR, autistic-like features, and mild non-specific dysmorphic features. These genes  belong to four functional categories, including neuronal transcription factor genes  (NFIA at 1p31.3, MEF2C at 5q14.3, andCAMAT1at 1p36.23p36.31), neuron-specific  splicing factor genes (RBFOX1 at 16p13.2p13.3), genes involved in synapse formation  and maintenance (CNTNAP2 at 7q35 and LRFN5 at 14q21.2), and genes involved in  neurotransmission (CHRNA7 at 15q13.3 and IL1RAPL1 at Xp21.2p21.3). Our report  expands the list of neurodevelopmental genes deleted in various neurobehavioral  phenotypes, expands the phenotypes caused by haploinsufficiency of previously  reported critical neurodevelopmental genes, and elucidates the clinical relevance  and need for careful clinical interpretation of some small CNVs<500 kb. This report  also suggests that small clinically relevant deletions encompassing critical  synaptic and other neurodevelopmental genes can present clinically with various  neurobehavioral phenotypes, which implies the existence of overlapping neuronal  pathways in the pathogenesis of these phenotypes.",

        "Title": "Inherited microdeletion in Xp21.3-22.1 involved in non-specific mental retardation.",
        "Abstract": "X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) is a genetically and clinically heterogeneous  common disorder. A cumulative frequency of about 1/600 male births was estimated by  different authors, including the fragile X syndrome, which affects 1/4000 males.  Given this very high cumulative frequency, identification of genes and molecular  mechanisms involved in other XLMRs, represents a challenging task of considerable  medical importance. In this report we describe clinical and molecular investigations  in the family of a mentally retarded boy for whom a microdeletion in Xp21.3-22.1 was  detected within the frame of a previously reported systematic search for deletion  using STS-PCR screening. Thorough clinical investigation of the sibling showed that  two affected brothers exhibit a moderate non-specific mental retardation without any  additional neurological impairment, statural growth deficiency or characteristic  dysmorphy. Molecular analysis revealed that the microdeletion observed in this  family is an inherited defect which cosegregates with mental retardation as an  X-linked recessive condition, since both non-deleted boys and transmitting mother  are normal. These results and the inherited microdeletion detected within the same  region associated with non-specific MR, reported by Raeymaekers et al., suggest that  Xp21.3 MR locus is prone to deletions. Therefore, search for microdeletions in the  eight families assigned by linkage analysis to this region might allow a better  definition of the critical region and an identification of the gene involved in this  X-linked mental retardation.",

In spite of the recent publications  of two draft sequences for the human genome, this region seems to be largely  unmapped and unsequenced. Here we report an integrated physical and transcript map  of approximately 2-Mb from DXS8004 to DXS365. Using sequence tagged site  (STS)-content mapping and chromosome walking, we assembled a genomic clone contig of  54 BACs and one cosmid with an estimated 4.5-fold coverage of this region. The  minimum tiling path consists of 23 BACs and one cosmid. Onto this contig, we mapped  30 new STSs derived from the unique end-sequences of the BACs, three expressed  sequence tags, five genes, and seven CpG islands. This integrated map provides a  unique resource for the positional cloning of candidate disease genes mapping to  Xp22.1 and is therefore of value for the completion of the genomic sequence of this  region.",

Here, we report  on the cloning and characterization of a novel gene, DXS6673E, that maps to Xq13.1,  is subject to X-inactivation and is disrupted in the 5' untranslated region by a  balanced X;13 translocation in a mentally retarded female. The DXS6673E gene is  highly conserved among vertebrates and its expression is most abundant in brain. It  encodes a hydrophilic protein of 1358 amino acids (aa) that does not show sequence  homology to other known proteins. A segment of this protein consisting of neutral  and hydrophobic aa with a proline residue in every second position may represent a  transmembrane domain. Almost complete sequence identity was found between the 3' end  of the DXS6673E gene and two expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and between the 5' end  of the DXS6673E gene and a third EST. Moreover, weaker sequence similarity was  observed between coding regions and two other ESTs.",

        "Abstract": "We report linkage data on a new large family with non-specific X linked mental  retardation (MRX), using 24 polymorphic markers covering the entire X chromosome. We  could assign the underlying disease gene, denoted MRX46, to the Xq25-q26 region.  MRX46 is tightly linked to the markers DXS8072, HPRT, and DXS294 with a maximum lod  score of 5.12 at theta=0. Recombination events were observed with DXS425 in Xq25 and  DXS984 at the Xq26-Xq27 boundary, which localises MRX46 to a 20.9 cM (12 Mb)  interval. Several X linked mental retardation syndromes have been mapped to the same  region of the X chromosome. In addition, the localisation of two MRX genes, MRX27  and MRX35, partially overlaps with the linkage interval obtained for MRX46. Although  an extension of the linkage analysis for MRX35 showed only a minimal overlap with  MRX46, it cannot be excluded that the same gene is involved in several of these MRX  disorders. On the other hand, given the considerable genetic heterogeneity in MRX,  one should be extremely cautious in using interfamilial linkage data to narrow down  the localisation of MRX genes. Therefore, unless the underlying gene(s) is  characterised by the analysis of candidate genes, MRX46 can be considered a new  independent MRX locus.",

        "Abstract": "This report describes the first cases of X-linked mental retardation with a marker X  chromosome seen in South Africa, and forms part of an ongoing study. The marker was  found in 11 affected males and 1 carrier female in 4 families investigated. The  demonstration of the marker X chromosome characterized by a fragile site at the long  arm (fra(X) (q27) in association with nonspecific X-linked mental retardation  heralds a new era in cytogenetics. The attention of human geneticists everywhere is  focused on various aspects of this fascinating phenomenon. It has now become  possible to diagnose an apparently common familial cytogenetic condition with a high  risk of recurrence and to identify female carriers; perhaps in time we will be able  to provide prenatal diagnosis. Because of the familial involvement through X-linked  inheritance the syndrome is believed to be more common than trisomy 21. The nature  of the association of mental retardation with the marker X chromosome is unknown,  but it could be related to close linkage with abnormal gene(s) or due to faulty  transcription of the genes beyond the fragile site.",

No significant  differences between the Williams syndrome and Prader-Willi or mentally retarded  groups on any of the test questions were found.

Thorough investigation of an MRX  critical region in Xp22.1-21.3 enabled us to identify a new gene expressed in brain  that is responsible for a non-specific form of X-linked mental retardation. This  gene encodes a 696 amino acid protein that has homology to IL-1 receptor accessory  proteins. Non-overlapping deletions and a nonsense mutation in this gene were  identified in patients with cognitive impairment only. Its high level of expression  in post-natal brain structures involved in the hippocampal memory system suggests a  specialized role for this new gene in the physiological processes underlying memory  and learning abilities.",

Mutations can  occur at any point in embryonic development and the timing determines the extent of  distribution of the mutation throughout the body and different tissue types. The eye  and visual pathway offer a unique opportunity to study somatic and gonosomal mosaic  mutations as the eye consists of tissues derived from all three germ layers allowing  disease pathology to be assessed with noninvasive imaging. In this review, we  describe systemic and ocular manifestations in a child with mosaic Coffin-Siris  syndrome. The patient presented with a significant medical history of accommodative  esotropia and hyperopia, macrocephaly, polydactyly, global developmental delay,  hypotonia, ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) obstruction, and brain MRI abnormalities.  The ophthalmic findings in this patient were nonspecific, however, they are  consistent with ocular manifestations reported in other patients with Coffin-Siris  syndrome. We also review ophthalmic findings of select mosaic chromosomal and  single-gene disorders. Ophthalmic assessment alongside clinical genetic testing may  play an important role in diagnosis of genetic syndromes as well as understanding  disease pathology, particularly when mosaicism plays a role.",

        "Abstract": "ADAT3-related intellectual disability has been recently described in 24 individuals  from eight Saudi families who had cognitive impairment and strabismus. Other common  features included growth failure, microcephaly, tone abnormalities, epilepsy, and  nonspecific brain abnormalities. A single homozygous founder mutation  (c.382G>A:p.(V128M)) in the ADAT3 gene, which encodes a protein that functions in  tRNA editing, was identified in all affected individuals. In this report, we present  additional 15 individuals from 11 families (10 Saudis and 1 Emirati) who are  homozygous for the same founder mutation. In addition to the universal findings of  intellectual disability and strabismus, the majority exhibited microcephaly and  growth failure. Additional features not reported in the original cohort include  dysmorphic facial features (prominent forehead, up-slanted palpebral fissures,  epicanthus, and depressed nasal bridge), behavioral problems (hyperactivity and  aggressiveness), recurrent otitis media, and growth hormone deficiency.  ADAT3-related intellectual disability is an important recognizable cause of  intellectual disability in Arabia.",

Verb knowledge was of particular interest, as it is  known to be a predictor of later syntactic development. Fifty participants with DS,  aged 10-21 years, 29 participants with ID, 10-21 years, and 29 participants with TD,  4-9 years, completed measures of receptive vocabulary (PPVT-4), nonverbal ability  (Leiter-R), and phonological memory (Nonword Repetition subtest of the CTOPP).  Groups were compared on percentage correct of noun, verb and attribute items on the  PPVT-4. Results revealed that on verb items, the participants with ID performed  significantly better than both participants with DS and TD, even when overall  receptive vocabulary ability and phonological memory were held constant. Groups with  DS and TD showed the same pattern of lexical knowledge, performing better on nouns  than both verbs and attributes. In contrast, the group with ID performed similarly  on nouns and verbs, but worse on attributes.",

MRX30 maps to a 28 cM region flanked by the loci DXS990 (Xq21.3) and  DXS424 (Xq24). A significant multipoint lod score of 2.78 was detected between the  loci DXS1120 and DXS456. MRX31 maps to a 12 cM region that spans the centromere from  DXS1126 (Xp11.23) to DXS1124 (Xq13.3). Significant two-point lod scores, at a  recombination fraction of zero, were obtained with the loci DXS991 (Zmax = 2.06), AR  (Zmax = 3.44), PGK1P1 (Zmax = 2.06) and DXS453 (Zmax = 3.31). The MRX30 localisation  overlaps that of MRX8, 13, 20 and 26 and defines the position of a new MRX gene on  the basis of a set of non-overlapping regional localisations. The MRX31 localisation  overlaps the localisations of many of the pericentromeric MRX loci (MRX 1, 4, 5, 7,  8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 20, 22 and 26). There are now at least 8 distinct loci  associated with non-specific mental retardation on the X chromosome defined, in  order from pter to qter, by localisation for MRX24, MRX2, MRX10, MRX1, MRX30, MRX27,  FRAXE and MRX3.",

The near complete absence of affected males in RTT families  has been explained by the lethal effect of an X-linked gene mutation in hemizygous  affected males. We report here on a novel mutation (A140V) in the MECP2 gene  detected in one female with mild mental retardation. In a family study, the A140V  mutation was found to segregate in the affected daughter and in four adult sons with  severe mental retardation. These results indicate that MECP2 mutations are not  necessarily lethal in males and that they can be causative of non-specific X-linked  mental retardation.",

        "Abstract": "We have recently shown that mutations in oligophrenin-1 (OPHN1) are responsible for  non-specific X-linked mental retardation (MRX). The structure of the gene encoding  the OPHN1 protein was determined by isolation of genomic DNA clones from the human  cosmid library. Genomic fragments containing exons were sequenced, and the sequences  of the exons and flanking introns were defined. Knowledge of the genomic structure  of the OPHN1 gene, which spans at least 500 kb and consists of 25 exons, will  facilitate the search for additional mutations in OPHN1. OPHN1 was screened for  mutations in 164 subjects with non-specific mental retardation. Three nucleotide  substitutions were identified, one of which was a silent mutation in the codon  threonine 301 at position 903 (G-->C). The other substitutions were located in exon  2, a G-->A substitution at position 133 (A45T), and in exon 10, a C-->T substitution  at position 902 (T301M), but these are common polymorphisms rather than  disease-causing mutations.",

        "Abstract": "Overt aggression in its various forms is the most prevalent symptom presenting to  pediatric mental health providers, regardless of setting. It is a behavior with a  heterogeneous etiology and requires a comprehensive approach to evaluation and  treatment. Evaluation of the aggressive child must assess medical, neurologic,  psychiatric, psychosocial, familial, and/or educational contributions to behavioral  dyscontrol. Multimodal treatment is generally required. At present, there is no  single medication to recommend for the treatment of aggressive behavior. Multiple  medications have clinically been used in a nonspecific fashion to target excessive  childhood aggression. Although successful for some, this approach increases risk for  ineffective interventions accompanied by side effects. Until a scientific  understanding of the developmental neurobiology of aggression leads to more specific  treatment, this review suggests the use of a diagnostic-based approach to the  pharmacology of aggression (FIG. 1). Descriptive diagnostic techniques should be  used to define the presence of any primary or comorbid psychiatric disorder that  presents with aggression as an associated symptom. Treating aggression in the  context of these psychiatric syndromes appears to be the most direct approach.  Aggression occurring in the context of a medication-responsive psychiatric diagnosis  appears most sensitive to pharmacologic intervention. Presently, evidence for  efficacy is strongest for aggression in the context of ADHD, psychotic disorder,  adolescent-onset bipolar disorder, and ictal aggression It remains less clear that  medication can help aggression when it occurs independently of a pharmacologically  treatable comorbid psychiatric disorder. Aggression may respond to a target symptom  approach where discrete behavioral symptoms that contribute to aggression, such as  irritability, explosiveness, fear, or impulsivity, may be modified by medication  intervention (FIG. 1). When treatment is approached in this fashion, it is standard  practice to use the least toxic and safest intervention first. Behavioral treatment  based on contingency management principles could be initially recommended.  Medication trials should first use medications that have demonstrated empiric  efficacy in reducing aggression (TABLE 1) and that have a favorable safety profile.  Neuroleptics to treat aggression in nonpsychotic psychiatrically referred youth  should be kept to a minimum, secondary to their significant adverse risk profile.  Alternative medications, such as selective serotonin reuptake-inhibiting  antidepressants, buspirone, lithium, anticonvulsants, opiate blocking agents,  propranolol, nadolol, and clonidine, deserve more clinical research in pediatric  aggression. These medications may offer effective and less toxic alternatives in the  pharmacologic treatment of inappropriate excessive childhood aggression.",

        "Title": "Impairment of cerebello-thalamo-frontal pathway in Rab-GDI mutated patients with  pure mental deficiency.",
        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Rab-GDI mutations are responsible for \"pure\" mental deficiency, without  any specific clinical features or brain malformation. Therefore, screening for  mutations in mentally retarded patients is not available on a routine basis.  Moreover, neuronal networks involved in mental deficiency still remain largely  unknown. METHODS: We performed a fine neuropsychological and imaging study in five  patients from two unrelated families, affected with mental deficiency due to a  mutation in the Rab-GDI gene. High resolution 3D brain MRI of the five mentally  retarded adult males (mean age 33 years) were compared to MRI of 14 healthy males  (mean age 35 years) using a Voxel-Based Morphometric analysis (VBM). RESULTS: All  patients had isolated moderate mental retardation (WAIS-III IQ range, 41-50; mean  45) without specific morphological or behavioural features. No obvious brain  abnormality was observed on visual inspection of individual scans. Using VBM  analysis, Rab-GDI mutated patients' MRIs exhibited significant brain changes  compared to normal subjects (p<0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons): increased  grey matter density in left cerebellum and in left angular gyrus, decreased grey  matter volume in thalami, decreased white matter density in prefrontal lobes, right  fusiform occipito-temporal gyrus, and decreased white matter volume in cerebellar  peduncles. CONCLUSIONS: These morphological changes observed in Rab-GDI mutated  patients, mainly localized in the cerebello-thalamo-prefrontal pathway, are  consistent with the hypothesis that the cerebellum is one of the critical components  of a global learning network. Our results open new avenues in the diagnosis of  non-specific mental deficiency using gene-specific \"brain maps\" as endophenotypes.",

        "Abstract": "Efforts to understand the genetic basis of mental retardation are greatly assisted  by the identification of families with multiple relatives with mental retardation  that clinical geneticists encounter in the routine practice of their profession.  Here we describe a linkage study of a four generation family in which X linked  recessive mental retardation (XLMR) is associated with minor dysmorphism and  premature death of the affected males. Microsatellite based polymorphic loci evenly  spaced over the entire X chromosome were used initially to detect linkage to Xq28.  Further analysis identified a haplotype of Xq28 markers bounded proximally by locus  DXS1113 and distally by DXS1108 that cosegregated with XLMR in this family. Two  point lod scores > 3.0 provided strong evidence that the gene locus responsible for  XLMR in this family is within this 7 Mb region of Xq28. The minor anomalies noted in  some affected males were not distinctive enough to suggest a unique syndrome. None  of our patients had features of the Waisman-Laxova syndrome or the PPM-X syndrome.  The possibility of allelism with any of the five other non-specific XLMR syndromes  (MRX3, MRX16, MRX25, MRX28, and MRX41) mapped to Xq28 could not be excluded. While  the recognition of a gene responsible for this disorder needs much additional work,  multiple female relatives at risk in this family benefit immediately from knowing  their genotype and heterozygotes will have the opportunity to undergo prenatal  diagnosis.",

We could  assign the underlying disease gene, denoted MRX65, to the pericentromeric region,  with flanking markers DXS573 in Xp11.3 and DXS990 in Xq21.33. A maximum LOD score of  3.64 was found at markers ALAS2 (Xp11.22) and DXS453 (Xq12) at straight theta = 0.  Twenty-five of the 58 reported MRX families are linked to a region that is partially  overlapping with the region reported here. Extension of the pedigree showed a number  of unaffected distant relatives with haplotypes corresponding to the disease locus.  Apparently, a new mutation in a female is causative for the disease in the family  reported here. Furthermore, we show the importance of combining clinical,  cytogenetic, and molecular studies since one of the family members, expected to be  affected by the same genetic defect, has a 48,XXXY karyotype.",

In affected male and female carriers the marker chromosome varied in appearance and  was not present in all metaphases. The significance of this study in relation to  previously reported pedigrees showing non-specific X-linked mental retardation is  discussed.",

        "Abstract": "An 8-year-old Caucasian girl presented with mild dysmorphic features and  intellectual disability (ID) affecting multiple spheres. Dysmorphisms included a  high forehead with up-slanting palpebral fissures, prominent nasal root and bridge,  flattened maxilla, high-arched palate, and anterior frenulum. Structural brain  anomalies included reduced periventricular white matter volume and thin corpus  callosum. The presence of HbH bodies and her clinical presentation raised suspicion  for autosomal alpha-thalassemia mental retardation syndrome (ATR-16). Whole-genome  array analysis at 1 Mb resolution was performed, which revealed a sub-microscopic  loss of 16p involving clones RP11-344L6 at 0.1 Mb, RP1-121I4 at 0.2 Mb and  RP11-334D3 at 1 Mb. FISH confirmed deletion (del) of the terminal clone (RP1-121I4)  on 16pter, which was de novo in origin. The more proximal clone RP11-334D3 (at 1 Mb)  showed diminished FISH signal intensity on one of the homologues, suggesting that  one breakpoint occurred within this clone. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) confirmed a de  novo deletion encompassing SOX8 (at 0.97 Mb). ATR-16 is characterized by ID with  mild, nonspecific dysmorphic features, and is associated with terminal del16p (MIM  No. 141750). Cases of isolated monosomy for 16p are rarely described; such  descriptions help to delineate the syndrome in the absence of confounding karyotypic  anomalies. We describe detailed molecular cytogenetic and clinical findings relating  to a subject with ATR-16.",

        "Abstract": "Although often described as temperamentally \"easy\" and sociable, children with Down  syndrome also exhibit behavior problems. Affective development is important for  social and behavioral competence. We examined negative affective expressions and a  range of emotion regulation/coping strategies during a frustrating task in a sample  of children with Down syndrome, nonspecific mental retardation, and typical  development. Results revealed that children with Down syndrome displayed  significantly more frustration and more orienting to the experimenter without asking  for help. Typical children used more goal-directed strategies, including  assistance-seeking and cognitive self-soothing. Findings suggest that children with  Down syndrome may use a limited repertoire of strategies for coping with  frustration. Suggestions for future intervention studies are provided.",

        "Abstract": "Rett syndrome (RTT) is usually described as an X-linked dominant disorder that is  lethal prenatally to males. While this hypothesis stemmed from the nearly exclusive  recognition of the classical features in females and the scarcity of similarly  affected or severely affected brothers of girls manifesting the classic phenotype,  there are actually no pedigree data to support it. The identification of  methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 gene (MECP2) as the causative gene for most cases of  RTT allows us to examine the fate of males with a mutation in the gene. Although the  number of cases is small, mutations in MECP2 that lead to the classical phenotype in  females do not appear to result in prenatal lethality of affected hemizygous males.  It is likely that sporadic cases are not ascertained because of the relative  non-specific congenital onset encephalopathy. Males who have MECP2 mutations and  Klinefelter syndrome or who are mosaic for the mutation are more likely to present  with a RTT-like phenotype.",

        "Abstract": "We have previously reported linkage analysis in 3 families with non-specific  X-linked mental retardation (XLMR). This used RFLPs and was limited by the  relatively low informativeness and density of markers available. We have performed a  new linkage analysis using microsatellites (including new Genethon markers) in the  two most informative families. In the MRX2 family, a lod score of 2.61 at theta =  0.05 had previously been obtained with DXS85 in Xp22.2. We now report a tighter  linkage with AFM 135xe7 (DXS989, z = 4.62 at theta = 0.00) and established the order  DXS85-DXS207-DXS999 (AFM234 y12)-MRX2, DXS365, DXS1052 (AFM 163yh2), DXS989-DXS1065  (AFM224zf2), DMD 3'. The localization of MRX2 in Xp22.2-p22.1 is thus clearly  different from the more distal MRX gene defined by patients with contiguous gene  syndromes. In the MRX4 family, a maximum lod score of 2.53 at theta = 0.00 had been  obtained with DXS159 in Xq13. Our present study did not show recombination from  ALAS2 in Xp11.21 to DXS441 in Xq13.3 (z = 3.38 at theta = 0.00 for the latter  marker) and the closest flanking markers are DXS255 in Xp11.22 and DXYS1 in Xq21.3.  Reduced recombination around the centromere prevents precise mapping. The  localisation of MRX4 overlaps with that of several other MRX families.",

        "Title": "De novo and biallelic DEAF1 variants cause a phenotypic spectrum.",
        "Abstract": "PURPOSE: To investigate the effect of different DEAF1 variants on the phenotype of  patients with autosomal dominant and recessive inheritance patterns and on DEAF1  activity in vitro. METHODS: We assembled a cohort of 23 patients with de novo and  biallelic DEAF1 variants, described the genotype-phenotype correlation, and  investigated the differential effect of de novo and recessive variants on  transcription assays using DEAF1 and Eif4g3 promoter luciferase constructs. RESULTS:  The proportion of the most prevalent phenotypic features, including intellectual  disability, speech delay, motor delay, autism, sleep disturbances, and a high pain  threshold, were not significantly different in patients with biallelic and  pathogenic de novo DEAF1 variants. However, microcephaly was exclusively observed in  patients with recessive variants (p\u2009<\u20090.0001). CONCLUSION: We propose that different  variants in the DEAF1 gene result in a phenotypic spectrum centered around  neurodevelopmental delay. While a pathogenic de novo dominant variant would also  incapacitate the product of the wild-type allele and result in a dominant-negative  effect, a combination of two recessive variants would result in a partial loss of  function. Because the clinical picture can be nonspecific, detailed phenotype  information, segregation, and functional analysis are fundamental to determine the  pathogenicity of novel variants and to improve the care of these patients.",

Four of these  localizations cross the dystrophin brain promoter, a candidate locus for MRX. None  of the affected individuals who were tested showed variation suggestive of a  deletion. No consistent clinical features were observed between or within 4 of the 5  families. In MRX12, prematurity or low birth weight, hypotelorism and short stature  were seen in several affected males. Heterozygote manifestations occurred in 3  families. There was no evidence to suggest involvement of the same gene in more than  one family, nor to clinically separate these families into distinct genetic  entities. Non-overlapping localizations for MRX1 and MRX10 demonstrate the existence  of at least 2 separate loci among these 5 families.",

Androgen insensitivity syndrome is a  disorder of male sexual differentiation caused by a defect in the androgen receptor  (AR) gene (Xq11-q12). Two subjects with CAIS resulting from a complete deletion of  the AR gene have previously been reported, one of whom also has MR. We have  identified another mentally retarded person with a complete deletion of the AR gene.  The deletion in the two patients with CAIS and MR extends past the AR gene and  includes several marker loci both proximal and distal to the AR gene, the limits of  the deletions being DXS1 and DXS905. The deletions in the CAIS patients who do not  have MR do not include any of the markers outside the AR gene itself. These data  suggest that located close to the AR gene is a gene which is implicated in  non-specific MR.",

        "Abstract": "Knowing the origin of cytogenetic abnormalities detected in individuals with mental  retardation and dysmorphic features is essential to genetic counselling of affected  families. To illustrate this, we report on six families with transmitted cytogenetic  abnormalities and discuss the genotype-phenotype correlations, including the  possibility of the abnormalities being normal genomic variants. The abnormalities  were detected using metaphase HR-CGH; their size was estimated to range from 1.6 to  7.5 Mb using tiling path array-CGH and real-time PCR. The abnormalities were  transmitted through two to four generations and included interstitial deletions of  1p31.3-p32.1, 2q13, 10q11.21-q11.23, and 13q31.1; a duplication of 1p34.1-p34.2; and  in one family both a deletion of 18q21.1 and a duplication of 4q35.1-q35.2. The  probands were mentally retarded and had nonspecific dysmorphic features except for  one patient with the Bohring-Opitz syndrome. We considered the abnormalities in two  families to be clinically significant: In one family, the proband's brain  abnormality was comparable to previously reported abnormalities in individuals with  a similar duplication of 1p31-p32. Congenital heart disease was previously mapped to  the chromosomal region of 18q that was affected in the proband of another family.  The carrier parents in both families had mild clinical features. In two families the  abnormalities were considered as coincidental findings, and in two further families  the abnormalities were insufficient to explain the phenotypes of the probands but  possibly were related to a milder phenotype in other family members. These cases  illustrate the need for careful assessment of the extended family in order to  interpret the phenotypic consequences of abnormalities identified using array-CGH.",

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: It has been reported that de novo heterozygous variants of DEAF1 can  cause DEAF1-associated neurodevelopmental disorder. The purpose of this article is  to explore the clinical and genetic characteristics of Chinese patients harboring de  novo DEAF1 variants. METHODS: We assembled a cohort of six unrelated patients with  de novo variants in DEAF1. Clinical and genetic features of these patients were  summarized. RESULTS: Each child showed intellectual disability (ID)/ global  developmental delay (GDD). Severe language impairment was prominent. Behavior  problems, seizures, sleep disturbance, and a high pain threshold were common  features. DEAF1-related seizures were reported to be difficult to treat or  intractable. Seizures in our cohort were almost all treatable. Valproic acid was the  most commonly used drug. Five heterozygous missense mutations of DEAF1 gene were  identified, three of which (p.W234C, p.L203P, p.H275Q) were not published in  literature before. CONCLUSION: Mutations of DEAF1 gene should be considered in  ID/GDD patients with a nonspecific phenotype, comprising intellectual disability,  prominent speech delay, abnormal behaviors, especially autism. In our study,  DEAF1-related epilepsy is completely treatable in Eastern-Asian individuals when  compared to patients in other regions, and valproic acid can be used as a first  choice. The knowledge of DEAF1-related neurodevelopmental disorder and the de novo  variant database of DEAF1 were expanded.",

The  phenotype of this condition includes severe intellectual disability, as well as  distinctive craniofacial features, including brachycephaly, synophrys, arched  eyebrows, \"cupid's bow\" upper lip, and microdontia. In addition, nonspecific  skeletal anomalies are common, including bifid ribs, scoliosis, and spinal fusion.  Only 19 molecularly confirmed patients have been previously described. Here, we  present four patients with CFTD, including three brothers from a Pakistani  background and an additional unrelated white Scottish patient. All share the  characteristic craniofacial appearance, with severe intellectual disability and  skeletal abnormalities. We further define the phenotype with comparison to the  published literature, and present images to define the dysmorphic features in a  previously unreported ethnic group. All of our patient series are homozygous for the  same c.292_293del (p.Ser98*) TMCO1 pathogenic variant, which has been previously  reported only in an isolated Amish population. Thus we provide evidence that CFTD  may be more common than previously thought. The patients presented here further  delineate the phenotypic spectrum of CFTD and provide evidence for a recurrent  pathogenic variant in TMCO1.",

        "Title": "IL1 receptor accessory protein like, a protein involved in X-linked mental  retardation, interacts with Neuronal Calcium Sensor-1 and regulates exocytosis.",
        "Abstract": "Previously, human genetics-based approaches allowed us to show that mutations in the  IL-1 receptor accessory protein-like gene (IL1RAPL) are responsible for a  non-specific form of X-linked mental retardation. This gene encodes a predicted  protein of 696 amino acids that belongs to a novel class of the IL-1/Toll receptor  family. In addition to the extracellular portion consisting of three Ig-like domains  and the intracellular TIR domain characteristic of the IL-1/Toll receptor family,  IL1RAPL contains a specific 150 amino acid carboxy terminus that has no significant  homology with any protein of known function. In order to begin to elucidate the  function of this IL-1/Toll receptor-like protein, we have assessed the effect of  recombinant IL1RAPL on the binding affinity of type I IL-1R for its ligands  IL-1alpha and beta and searched for proteins interacting with the specific carboxy  terminus domain of IL1RAPL. Our results show that IL1RAPL is not a protein receptor  for IL-1. In addition we present here the identification of Neuronal Calcium  Sensor-1 (NCS-1) as an IL1RAPL interactor. Remarkably, although NCS-1 and its  non-mammalian homologue, frequenin, are members of a highly conserved EF-hand Ca(2+)  binding protein family, our data show that IL1RAPL interacts only with NCS-1 through  its specific C-terminal domain. The functional relevance of IL1RAPL activity was  further supported by the inhibitory effect on exocytosis in PC12 cells  overexpressing IL1RAPL. Taken together, our data suggest that IL1RAPL may regulate  calcium-dependent exocytosis and provide insight into the understanding of  physiopathological mechanisms underlying cognitive impairment resulting from IL1RAPL  dysfunction.",

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: This study examined mothers' representation of their children's inner  world - maternal insightfulness - and its link to sensitive maternal behaviour. We  aimed to understand some of the parental processes that underlie parenting children  with intellectual disability (ID). METHODS: The sample included 38 mothers and their  children with non-specific ID aged 2.5 to 5.5\u00a0years. Children had developmental  quotient scores of M\u00a0=\u00a056.29, SD\u00a0=\u00a09.65 and adaptive behaviour scores of M\u00a0=\u00a060.72,  SD\u00a0=\u00a010.43. We hypothesised that mothers who were insightful show more sensitive  behaviour when interacting with their children than non-insightful mothers do.  Maternal insightfulness was assessed using the insightfulness interview, and  maternal sensitive behaviour during mother-child interaction was assessed using the  emotional availability observation scales. RESULTS: Forty-one per cent of the  mothers showed positive insightfulness regarding their children's inner world. These  mothers showed higher levels of sensitive behaviour than did the non-insightful  mothers. The insightfulness-sensitivity link was not associated with any of the  mothers' or the children's characteristics, including the level of developmental  quotient, suggesting that these parental constructs are not simply a reflection of  the level of the children's developmental delay. CONCLUSIONS: Better understanding  of the mechanism of parenthood, including the insightfulness-sensitivity link, may  help personalise the support provided to parents of children with ID. The  associations between maternal insightfulness and sensitivity imply that promoting  maternal insightfulness may enhance mothers' sensitivity towards their children.",

        "Abstract": "This study reviewed hospital and genetics clinic records of 411 patients evaluated  in our department from 1986 to 1997 inclusive. Major objectives were to establish  how often and under what circumstances a specific genetic/syndrome diagnosis was  made and to determine the value of laboratory tests in the hope of gaining a more  selective approach to referral, evaluation, and use of the laboratory. A specific  genetic/syndrome diagnosis was made in 19.9% of cases, and in a further 4.4% the  referring diagnosis was eliminated but no new diagnosis made. There was a  significant excess of affected males (277:134) and of affected male sib pairs over  expectation, suggesting an additional, potentially important, contribution from  nonspecific X-linked mental retardation (MR). Factors associated with making a  diagnosis included referral from a pediatrician or neurologist, absence of cerebral  palsy, presence of more than three minor anomalies and/or an unusual appearance, a  recognizable Gestalt or key anomaly. There was a linear relationship between the  likelihood of making a diagnosis and the number of minor anomalies. Factors not  associated with making a diagnosis included the year when the patient was seen,  degree of MR, number of prior specialists seen, presence of a major malformation,  occurrence of seizures, and a head circumference either <3rd or >97th centile.  Although chromosome studies were somewhat less likely to be ordered in patients with  less severe MR, the positive rate was unaffected by the severity of the MR. The rate  of abnormal results was positively correlated with the presence of minor anomalies  and/or an unusual appearance. None of 134 studies carried out on patients with </=3  minor anomalies alone were positive. Fragile X studies were less likely to be  ordered with increasing levels of MR and 10 of 14 positive test results were among  those with mild delay. Thirteen of 14 diagnoses were based on Gestalt. Molecular and  fluorescence in situ hybridization studies had a positive rate of >60% when ordered  by a clinical geneticist compared with 0% when ordered by other physicians. Results  showed that use of the laboratory was inconsistent and not clearly based on the  findings in a particular child. Significant changes in patterns of referral and the  evaluation process could be made that would result in significant economies of time  and laboratory use and a minimum level of missed diagnoses.",

Cytogenetic investigations revealed an  inverted X chromosome (p21.3q27.1). A similar chromosomal rearrangement was detected  in his mildly mentally retarded mother. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH),  using a panel of ordered YAC clones, allowed the identification of YACs spanning  both the Xp21.3 and Xq27.1 breakpoints, where many non-specific mental retardation  loci have been reported so far. Further investigations by FISH showed that the  IL1RAPL1 gene at Xp21.3 was disrupted by the X chromosome inversion and therefore  its inactivation may be related to the mental retardation observed in our patients.",

We report clinical, cytogenetic, and linkage data on a family with X linked  non-specific MR. Two point and multi-point linkage analysis with 18 polymorphic  markers, covering the entire chromosome, showed close linkage to DXS1001 and DXS425  with a maximal lod score of 2.41 at 0% recombination. DXS178 and the gene for  hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl-transferase (HPRT), located in Xq22 and Xq26  respectively, flank the mutation. All other chromosomal regions could be excluded  with odds of at least 100:1. To our knowledge there is currently no other  non-specific MR gene mapped to this region. Therefore, the gene causing MR in this  family can be considered to be a new, independent MRX locus (MRX35).",

The main goal of this  study was to investigate the good-imitator-poor-talker developmental profile in DS  at preschool age. Twenty children with Down syndrome (DS; mean nonverbal mental age  NMA 1 y10 m) and 15 children with non-specific mental retardation (NS-MR; mean NMA 1  y11 m) participated in this study. The Preschool Imitation and Praxis Scale (PIPS)  and the Dutch version of the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventories  (N-CDI) were used to determine absolute and relative (contrasted to a nonverbal  mental age reference) imitation and language abilities. Results revealed that there  was clear evidence for a good-imitator-poor-talker profile in preschoolers with DS.  However, only the advanced bodily imitation ability seems to be syndrome-specific.

        "Abstract": "Four Dutch male patients, two brothers from unrelated families were referred for  investigation of psychomotor and severe language/speech delay. All four patients  showed growth deficiency over the years. Facial features and poor body habitus were  quite similar in the patients and in their mothers. Brain MRI showed nonspecific  periventricular white matter lesions. In all the patients neuropsychological tests  revealed moderate mental retardation, attention deficit and hyperactivity with  impulsivity, a semantic-pragmatic language disorder, and oral dyspraxia. This  specific cognitive profile is different from other children with mental retardation  syndromes and seems to be unique. Excretion of creatine to creatinine ratio in urine  of the four boys was increased compared to controls and their creatine uptake in  fibroblasts was deficient. In the two brothers from the first pedigree, DNA sequence  analysis revealed a novel mutation in the splice donor site in intron 10 (IVS10 +  5G>C, c.1495 + 5G>C) of the SLC6A8 gene leading to skipping of exon 10. In the other  sib pair a novel missense mutation (c. 1361C>T; p.Pro544Leu) was found. These are  the first families reported, in which the clinical suspicion of a creatine  transporter disorder was raised on clinical grounds, before a brain 1H-MRS suggested  the diagnosis. Screening of apparently X-linked mental retarded patients with this  somatic and behavioral phenotype by the biochemical assay of creatine to creatinine  ratio in the urine or DNA sequence analysis of SLC6A8 is worthwhile even when 1H-MRS  is not available.",

        "Abstract": "Secretory fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) and their receptors are known for their  regulatory function in the early stages of neural development. FGF13, a nonsecretory  protein of the FGF family, is expressed in cerebral cortical neurons during  development and is a candidate gene for syndromal and nonspecific forms of  X-chromosome-linked mental retardation (XLMR). However, its function during  development remains unclear. We show that FGF13 acts intracellularly as a  microtubule-stabilizing protein required for axon and leading process development  and neuronal migration in the cerebral cortex. FGF13 is enriched in axonal growth  cones and interacts directly with microtubules. Furthermore, FGF13 polymerizes  tubulins and stabilizes microtubules. The loss of FGF13 impairs neuronal  polarization and increases the branching of axons and leading processes. Genetic  deletion of FGF13 in mice results in neuronal migration defects in both the  neocortex and the hippocampus. FGF13-deficient mice also exhibit weakened learning  and memory, which is correlated to XLMR patients' intellectual disability.",

        "Abstract": "We report the clinical, electroencephalographic, neurophysiologic, and neuroimaging  findings in eight children with infant-onset progressive myoclonus epilepsy, all of  whom had muscle biopsies performed as as part of the diagnostic evaluation. Each  child had myoclonic seizures, generalized tonic-clonic seizures, and neurologic  regression or marked developmental delay. Four children died before 3 years of age.  Electroencephalograms in seven children showed an abnormally slow background with  bilateral multifocal paroxysmal discharges but no burst suppression pattern or  photoparoxysmal response. Muscle biopsy specimens were submitted for histopathology  and respiratory-chain enzyme studies. Nonspecific abnormalities on light microscopy  or electron microscopy were found in seven samples, including increased  subsarcolemmal deposits of mitochondria or morphologic mitochondrial changes, but no  ragged-red fibers were seen. Respiratory-chain enzyme studies were performed on five  samples and in three children (all of whom had a history of elevated lactate in  serum or cerebrospinal fluid), there were low levels of rotenone-sensitive reduced  nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) cytochrome c reductase characteristic of a  defect in the complex I part of the respiratory-chain pathway. This study has shown  that infant-onset progressive myoclonus epilepsy can be distinguished from other  myoclonic epilepsy syndromes of infancy by clinical and electrographic features.  Furthermore, respiratory-chain enzyme defects are a relatively common cause of  infant-onset progressive myoclonus epilepsy. The absence of ragged-red fibers on  muscle histopathology does not preclude a mitochondrial enzyme abnormality.",

        "Title": "A third MRX family (MRX68) is the result of mutation in the long chain fatty  acid-CoA ligase 4 (FACL4) gene: proposal of a rapid enzymatic assay for screening  mentally retarded patients.",
        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The gene encoding fatty acid CoA ligase 4 (FACL4) is mutated in families  with non-specific X linked mental retardation (MRX) and is responsible for cognitive  impairment in the contiguous gene syndrome ATS-MR (Alport syndrome and mental  retardation), mapped to Xq22.3. This finding makes this gene a good candidate for  other mental retardation disorders mapping in this region. METHODS: We have screened  the FACL4 gene in eight families, two MRX and six syndromic X linked mental  retardation (MRXS), mapping in a large interval encompassing Xq22.3. RESULTS: We  have found a missense mutation in MRX68. The mutation (c.1001C>T in the brain  isoform) cosegregates with the disease and changes a highly conserved proline into a  leucine (p.P375L) in the first luciferase domain, which markedly reduces the  enzymatic activity. Furthermore, all heterozygous females showed completely skewed X  inactivation in blood leucocytes, as happens in all reported females with other  FACL4 point mutations or deletions. CONCLUSIONS: Since the FACL4 gene is highly  expressed in brain, where it encodes a brain specific isoform, and is located in  hippocampal and cerebellar neurones, a role for this gene in cognitive processes can  be expected. Here we report the third MRX family with a FACL4 mutation and describe  the development of a rapid enzymatic assay on peripheral blood that we propose as a  sensitive, robust, and efficient diagnostic tool in mentally retarded males.",

The three affected males had severe mental retardation (IQ 20 to  30), mutism, growth failure, frequent infections, seizures, and the following minor  anomalies: brachycephaly, frontal hair whorl, square face, large mouth, thick lips,  and prognathism. There was not a characteristic facies. Normal laboratory studies on  the proband included a karyotype with fragile X screening, skeletal survey, blood  amino acid, urine organic acid, and HGPRT levels. Linkage analysis was performed  with 10 X chromosome DNA probes of which probe DXS255 at chromosomal region Xp11.22  gave a maximal two point lod score of 2.10 if phase was inferred and 1.20 if it was  not. Crossovers were shown with probes mapping to regions Xp22, Xp21, and Xq28.  Comparison of these patients with 80 X linked causes of mental retardation,  including 41 which might be classified as 'non-specific', showed no other disorders  compatible with the phenotypic and linkage data.",

Our study confirms that cerebellar hypoplasia is a  hallmark of this syndrome. In addition, affected males display facial similarities  that can help the diagnosis.

An ethogram  with 88 behavior elements was generated, including body postures, verbalizations,  facial expressions, motor stereotypies, head postures, gaze behavior, gestures, and  interpersonal distance. Significant differences were detected between both groups in  classic ASD behaviors; in behaviors that are deficient in ASD according to  established theoretical models, such as symbolic play, gaze direction, gaze  following, and use of mental state language; in atypical behaviors that have also  been described previously in ethological studies with ASD; and in the nonspecific  behaviors of ASD, such as walk, look own body, explore, and cry. The predictive  success of a diagnosis of ASD in the logistic regression model with the ethogram's  factors was 98.4%. The results suggest that this ethogram is a powerful and useful  tool for both the detailed study of the social behaviors of autistic children and  adolescents, and for discriminating ASD and IDD.",

        "Abstract": "Rett syndrome (RTT) is an X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations  in the MECP2 gene, with apparent lethality in male embryos. However, recent studies  indicate that mutations in the MECP2 gene can cause congenital encephalopathy, an  Angelman-like phenotype and even nonspecific mental retardation in males. We report  on a 10-year-old boy with moderate mental retardation, hypotonia, obesity and  gynaecomastia and a de novo 2-bp deletion in the MECP2 gene that resulted in a  frameshift and premature stop codon. As some of the clinical features were  suggestive of the Prader-Willi syndrome, it might be worthwhile screening for MECP2  mutations in patients with an atypical Prader-Willi phenotype but without the  characteristic abnormalities on chromosome 15q. This report contributes to the  phenotypic knowledge of male patients with MECP2 mutations. Moreover, this is the  first reported male case of a de novo MECP2 mutation.",

A total of 33 microsatellite and  RFLP markers was typed. The gene for this XLMR condition was been linked to DXS1195,  with a lod score of 2.36 at theta = 0. The haplotype and multipoint linkage analyses  suggest localization of the MRX73 locus to an interval of 2 cM defined by markers  DXS8019 and DXS365, in Xp22.2. This interval contains the gene of Coffin-Lowry  syndrome (RSK2), where a missense mutation has been associated with a form of  non-specific mental retardation. Therefore, a search for RSK2 mutations was  performed in the MRX73 family, but no causal mutation was found. We hypothesize that  another unidentified XLMR gene is located near RSK2.",

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Attachment theory produced a fertile field of research and clinical  application. Although the topic of attachment of children with intellectual  disability (ID) has received increasing research attention over the past 15 years,  the empirical evidence is still limited. AIMS: We applied theoretical and empirical  knowledge of parenting typically developing children to examine the mother-child  relationship in the ID population. The aim was to examine maternal sensitivity and  structuring and its association with children's attachment classification and their  disability. METHODS: Forty preschool children (mean age 47.25, range 26-75 months)  with non-specific ID and their mothers participated in the study. The mean  developmental age was 25.92 months (SD\u202f=\u202f10.89), The DQ mean score was 55.45  (SD\u202f=\u202f17.28). We assessed children's quality of attachment using the SSP and  maternal interactive behavior using the Emotional Availability Scales. OUTCOMES:  Forty percent of children showed secure attachment, and 32.5% showed disorganized  attachment. Attachment classifications correlated significantly with maternal  sensitivity and maternal structuring but not with the child's cognitive disability.  CONCLUSIONS: The results point to the importance of maternal interactive behavior  for children with ID. Clinical implication may consider interventions aiming to  enhance maternal sensitivity and structuring to improve children's quality of  attachment.",

Few  cerebral imaging studies have been reported. We describe 9 patients with an  inversion duplication 8p, involving variable segments of the short arm of chromosome  8. MRI was performed in 8 patients and 2 patients underwent CT scanning. The images  were systematically reviewed. All patients suffered from severe mental retardation.  Head circumference was between 0 and + 2 SD in 7 patients. The corpus callosum was  absent in 6, and thin (but complete) in 3 patients. Hypoplasia of the (inferior)  cerebellar vermis was observed in 6 patients. Enlargement of the ventricular system  and associated hippocampal maldevelopment were found in all patients. The  supratentorial external CSF spaces were enlarged in 6 patients, and in 3 patients  there was a remarkable enlargement of the retrocerebellar arachnoidal space.  Cerebral white matter showed mildly delayed myelination in 7 patients, and  periventricular lesions of variable extent in 6 patients. The pattern of imaging  abnormalities was non-specific, but remarkably similar between patients. We found no  correlation between the severity of the clinical features, imaging results, and  extent of the chromosomal aberration.",

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mutations in the MECP2 gene (methyl-CpG-binding protein-2) are  responsible for 60-95% of cases of Rett syndrome (RTT), an X-linked dominant  neurodevelopmental disorder affecting mostly girls. Classic RTT is characterized by  normal early development followed by psychomotor regression and onset of  microcephaly, although variant forms are also observed. MECP2 has also been  implicated in variable mental retardation (MR) phenotypes, including X-linked Mental  Retardation (XLMR), Fragile-X-like Syndrome (FXS) and Angelman-like (AS) phenotypes.  AIM: The aim of the study was: (a) to evaluate the incidence and spectrum of MECP2  mutations in children with RTT and variant MR; (b) to evaluate phenotype-genotype  correlations. METHODS: Exons 3-4 were analyzed for mutations in 281 MR patients  (aged 13 months-27 years old, 144 males-137 females) consisting of 88 patients  referred for RTT and 193 patients referred for AS-like and FXS-like types of MR.  Statistical analysis included correlation between classic MECP2-positive and  MECP2-negative and variant RTT patients, and frequency of MECP2 mutations in the  various categories. RESULTS: Mutations were detected in \u2248 70% of classic and \u2248 21%  of variant RTT, respectively. Amongst MR cases, 2.1% carried MECP2 mutations.  MECP2-positive females had more problems in ambulation, muscle tone, tremor and  ataxia, respiratory disturbances, head growth, hand use and stereotypies. Classic  RTT-positive versus negative had significant respiratory and sitting problems and  versus variant RTT-positive females ambulatory, hand and stereotypies problems.  CONCLUSION: The analysis of the MECP2 gene could provide a diagnostic tool for RTT  and non-specific MR research.",

        "Title": "A validation study of the clinical diagnosis of Dup15q syndrome: Which symptoms  matter most?",
        "Abstract": "PURPOSE: Dup15q syndrome is a rare genetic disease with a fairly nonspecific  phenotype, clinical heterogeneity, and a wide spectrum of severity. However, no  formal characterization has been attempted to select clusters of symptoms, signs and  instrumental tests, to be used in the differential diagnosis with other  neurodevelopmental disorders. Thus, our purpose was to identify symptoms, signs and  instrumental findings, singly or in various combinations, favoring the early  diagnosis of the Dup15q syndrome and the indication for genetic testing. METHODS: 25  patients with Dup15q syndrome and 25 age and sex matched controls with other  neurodevelopmental disorders were the study population. Patients' history, clinical  and instrumental assessment were examined by five expert child neurologists blind to  the genetic diagnosis. Each rater was asked to make the diagnosis in three  subsequent steps: 1. Revision of the medical records; 2. Examination of the  videorecorded clinical findings; 3. Assessment of the instrumental tests.  Inter-rater agreement was measured with the Kendall's coefficient of concordance)  and the Kappa statistic. Sensitivity, specificity and predictive values for  symptoms, signs and instrumental findings, singly or in various combinations, were  measured. RESULTS: The Kendall's coefficient for the diagnosis of Dup15q syndrome  was 0.43 at step 1 was 0.43, at step 2 was 0.42, at step 3. Patients with past  feeding difficulties, hypotonia during the neonatal period, and epilepsy had >80 %  probability of having the Dup15q syndrome. CONCLUSION: Feeding difficulties,  hypotonia and epilepsy, though unspecific, can be used as signals of Dup15q syndrome  and focused search of genetic abnormalities.",

        "Abstract": "Ring chromosome is a peculiar genetic anomaly which may cause phenotypic  abnormalities even without a loss of genetic material. The ring formation of  chromosome ends induces difficulties in the sister chromatid separation at cell  division, resulting in increased cell death rate through the generation of secondary  aneuploid cells. Based on the in vitro analyses of own cases and a review of more  than 200 case reports published in the literature, the author presents some  conclusions on \"ring syndrome\", a non-specific clinical manifestation of ring  formation of any chromosome, consisting of the lack of (or poorly expressed) organic  manifestations, mild or borderline mental retardation, and a severe growth failure  which is not explained by organic, biochemical, or endocrine findings. It is also  suggested that the phenotypic manifestation of a ring chromosome is even less  expressed when the ring is transmitted to the next generation. Based on observations  of ring behaviour and the clinical phenotypes in a 3-generational family with a  mosaic supernumerary ring, it is not unrealistic to assume that there is a  transgenerational increase in the severity of the clinical manifestation resulting  from a less efficient elimination process against the ring (cytogenetic  anticipation).",

        "Abstract": "We used several microsatellite markers scattered along the X chromosome to search  for linkage relationships in a large Sardinian pedigree segregating for nonspecific  X-linked mental retardation (MRX). Markers DXS573 and AR, located at chromosomal  subregions Xp11.4-p11.22 and Xq11.2-q12, respectively, were found to segregate in  full concordance with the disease, leading to a LOD score of 4.21 at zero  recombination value. Recombination with the disease was found with markers MAOB and  DXS454 located at Xp11.4-p11.3 and Xq21.1-q22, respectively; accordingly, markers  distal to Xp11.4 and Xq22 also segregated independently of the disease. These  findings provide strong linkage evidence in favor of the localization of one MRX  mutational site in the pericentromeric region of the human X chromosome, justifying  the assignment of a new symbol (MRX26) to our pedigree. Finally, on the basis of the  recombinational events observed in the Xq21-q22 region, we have been able to refine  the assignment of marker DXS456 to Xq21.33-q22.",

Although a few cases of familial WBS have been reported in the  literature, molecular confirmation of the deletion has not been carried out in all  of them. Here, we report on the eighth clinically and molecularly confirmed  inherited WBS detected in a family with 'familial mental retardation.' A  comprehensive screening approach to mental retardation that included stepwise  karyotyping, assessment for fragile-X syndrome, subtelomeric rearrangements and  known microdeletion/microduplication syndromes, and a genome-wide array-CGH study  was applied. The father, the mother, and their daughter were all mentally  handicapped with nonspecific clinical manifestations and dysmorphic features. The  first child of the family died from multiple congenital anomalies. The father and  his daughter, who had never been suspected to have WBS, were diagnosed as having a  deletion of the WBS critical region. No other abnormalities were detected in the  family. Unlike other previously reported cases, in which the disease was ascertained  on the basis of clinical manifestations, the present report represents an example of  the detection of cryptic chromosomal abnormalities in mental retardation patients by  the stepwise application of high-throughput screening methods.",

        "Abstract": "X-linked forms of mental retardation (MR) affect approximately 1 in 600 males and  are likely to be highly heterogeneous. They can be categorized into syndromic (MRXS)  and nonspecific (MRX) forms. In MRX forms, affected patients have no distinctive  clinical or biochemical features. At least five MRX genes have been identified by  positional cloning, but each accounts for only 0.5%-1.0% of MRX cases. Here we show  that the gene TM4SF2 at Xp11.4 is inactivated by the X breakpoint of an X;2 balanced  translocation in a patient with MR. Further investigation led to identification of  TM4SF2 mutations in 2 of 33 other MRX families. RNA in situ hybridization showed  that TM4SF2 is highly expressed in the central nervous system, including the  cerebral cortex and hippocampus. TM4SF2 encodes a member of the tetraspanin family  of proteins, which are known to contribute in molecular complexes including beta-1  integrins. We speculate that through this interaction, TM4SF2 might have a role in  the control of neurite outgrowth.",

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Fragile X syndrome is the most frequent cause of mental retardation  linked to the X chromosome. In the majority of cases, the mutation responsible for  the syndrome is an expansion of the trinucleotide repeat (CGG)n, present in the 5'  region of exon 1 of the gene for mental retardation associated with fragile X  syndrome (FMR-1). AIM: To report the results of a fragile X screening in patients  with mental retardation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fragile X screening using polymerase  chain reaction methods was done in 386 X chromosomes from 300 patients (214 male),  aged 4 to 26 years old. The modified Hagerman test was applied to male patients.  Hybridization techniques were applied in a subgroup of 51 patients. RESULTS: (CGG)n  30 was the allele found with the highest frequency in 50.2% of patients. (CGG)n 29  was found in 29% of patients. One subject had an allele with 46 CGG repeats, which  corresponds to the gray zone. Hybridization studies were highly concordant with PCR,  detecting four males with fragile X syndrome and a carrier female. The average  clinical score of mental retardation not due to fragile X syndrome was 10.3 +/- 3.4  (range 3 to 23), and 97% of males had a score below 19. The concordance between  scores over 20 and molecular genotype was 98%. CONCLUSIONS: The distribution of  (CGG)n repeats, observed in this study, was significantly different to that  previously reported for a normal Chilean population. The dispersion of molecular  status and clinical score was lower than previously described using cytogenetic  techniques.",

Milder phenotypes have been associated with sequence variations in  the 3'-end of the CDKL5 gene. Identification of novel CDKL5 transcripts coding  isoforms characterized by an altered C-terminal region strongly questions the  eventual pathogenicity of sequence variations located in the 3'-end of the gene. We  investigated a group of 30 female patients with a clinically heterogeneous phenotype  ranging from nonspecific intellectual disability to a severe neonatal encephalopathy  and identified two heterozygous CDKL5 missense mutations, the previously reported  p.Val999Met and the novel mutation p.Pro944Thr. However, these mutations have also  been detected in their healthy father. Considering our results and all data from the  literature, we suggest that genetic variations beyond the codon 938 in human  CDKL5115 protein may have minor or no significance. It is probable that screening of  exons 19-21 of the CDKL5 gene is not useful in practical molecular diagnosis of  atypical Rett syndrome.",

        "Title": "Clinical features and blood iron metabolism markers in children with beta-propeller  protein associated neurodegeneration.",
        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation constitutes a group of  rare progressive movement disorders sharing intellectual disability and neuroimaging  findings as common denominators. Beta-propeller protein-associated neurodegeneration  (BPAN) represents approximately 7% of the cases, and its first signs are typically  epilepsy and developmental delay. We aimed to describe in detail the phenotype of  BPAN with a special focus on iron metabolism. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We present a  cohort of paediatric patients with pathogenic variants of WD-Repeat Domain 45 gene  (WDR45). The diagnosis was established by targeted panel sequencing of genes  associated with epileptic encephalopathies (n\u00a0=\u00a09) or by Sanger sequencing of WDR45  (n\u00a0=\u00a01). Data on clinical characteristics, molecular-genetic findings and other  performed investigations were gathered from all participating centres. Markers of  iron metabolism were analysed in 6 patients. RESULTS: Ten children (3 males, 7  females, median age 8.4 years) from five centres (Prague, Berlin, Vogtareuth,  Tubingen and Cologne) were enrolled in the study. All patients manifested first  symptoms (e.g. epilepsy, developmental delay) between 2 and 31 months (median 16  months). Seven patients were seizure-free (6 on antiepileptic medication, one  drug-free) at the time of data collection. Neurological findings were non-specific  with deep tendon hyperreflexia (n\u00a0=\u00a04) and orofacial dystonia (n\u00a0=\u00a03) being the most  common. Soluble transferrin receptor/log ferritin ratio was elevated in 5/6 examined  subjects; other parameters of iron metabolism were normal. CONCLUSION: Severity of  epilepsy often gradually decreases in BPAN patients. Elevation of soluble  transferrin receptor/log ferritin ratio could be another biochemical marker of the  disease and should be explored by further studies.",

        "Title": "Genetic Variants of the MTMR9 Gene Are Associated with Nonspecific Intellectual  Disability: A Family-Based Association Study.",
        "Abstract": "Background: Mutations within the myotubularin-related protein 9 gene (MTMR9) have  been identified in several families with nonsyndromic intellectual disability  (NSID), a generalized neurodevelopmental disorder; however, the relationship between  MTMR9 and NSID needs to be verified using a larger sample size. Aim: To explore  whether genetic variants in the MTMR9 gene are linked to susceptibility of NSID  among the Chinese population. Materials and Methods: Seven single nucleotide  polymorphisms (SNPs) of the MTMR9 gene (rs4559208, rs3824211, rs2164272, rs2164273,  rs1897951, rs6991606, and rs7815802) were analyzed using family-based association  testing among 258 Han Chinese NSID families. Results: Three SNPs of MTMR9 were  significantly associated with NSID (z\u2009=\u20092.152, p\u2009=\u20090.031 for rs4559208; z\u2009=\u20092.403,  p\u2009=\u20090.016 for rs2164273; and z\u2009=\u20092.758, p\u2009=\u20090.006 for rs7815802). Three alleles of  these SNPs were more likely to be transferred from the carrier parents to the  affected offspring. Haplotypes constructed using these SNPs also showed a similar  transmitting trend (z\u2009=\u20092.505, p\u2009=\u20090.012, \u03c7(2)((3))\u2009=\u20098.835, and global p\u2009=\u20090.032).  Carriers with the G-G-C haplotype showed a higher risk of NSID (odds ratio\u2009=\u20091.46,  95% confidence interval [1.01-2.09], p\u2009=\u20090.04) than others. In silico functional  predictions supported an etiological role for these three SNPs in NSID biology.  Conclusions: This study provides additional insights into the association of NSID  with specific alleles, and haplotypes within the MTMR9 gene. Genotypic analyses of  the MTMR9 gene should be considered for patients presenting with NSID of unknown  etiology.",

We hypothesized that there  are qualitative differences in these shared personality features.  Personality-motivation (measured using the Reiss Profiles) was compared for equal  numbers of age- and gender-matched individuals with Williams or Prader-Willi  syndrome or mental retardation due to nonspecific causes. Each syndrome featured  aberrant motivational profiles, and similarities were found across groups in various  domains. Significant differences emerged in the specific stimuli that motivated  behavior in several Reiss Profile domains.

        "Abstract": "Linkage analysis was carried out in a large four-generation German family  segregating for non-specific X-linked mental retardation. Affected males have  moderate intellectual handicap. Speech delay, deviant behaviour, and hyperactivity  have also been reported. Head circumference and testicular volumes are normal.  Cytogenetic analysis failed to show evidence for fragile site or structural  abnormality of the X chromosome. None of the obligatory carriers shows any clinical  symptoms. Close linkage without recombination (lod scores 1.74 to 2.05) has been  found between the disease locus (MRX1) and the polymorphic DNA loci DXS7  (Xp11.4-p11.3), MAOA (Xp11.3-p11.23), DXS255 (Xp11.22), and DXS159 (Xq12) suggesting  that the gene responsible for the disease in this family maps in the pericentromeric  region of the X chromosome. Linkage data obtained with the flanking marker loci OTC  (Xp21.1) and DXS95 (Xq21.2-q21.3) also were compatible with this localization of the  MRX1 gene. Close linkage to loci from Xp22, Xq22, Xq24-25, or Xq28 could be  excluded.",

Recently, genome-wide association studies  have led to the identification of new de novo mutations associated with this  epileptic syndrome. Herein, we report an 8-year-old child with intellectual  disability, severe postnatal microcephaly, Rett-like features, and LGS, carrying a  de novo missense mutation in the forkhead box G1 (FOXG1) gene. This gene is  responsible for FOXG1 syndrome, characterized by severe postnatal microcephaly,  moderate postnatal growth deficiency, mental retardation with poor social  interaction, stereotyped behavior and dyskinesias, absent language, sleep disorders,  and epilepsy. Nonspecific epilepsy syndromes have been associated with this genetic  disorder. Thus, we hypothesize that FOXG1 might be a new candidate gene in the  etiology of LGS and suggest screening for this gene in cases of LGS with concomitant  microcephaly and clinical features overlapping with Rett syndrome.",

Maladaptive behaviour was assessed with the Aberrant Behavior Checklist  (ABC), a 58-item structured interview which rates behaviours from 0 (not a problem)  to 3 (severe problem) and which yields five factors (I) irritability, agitation;  (II) lethargy, withdrawal; (III) stereotypic behavior; (IV) hyperactivity,  non-compliance; and (V) inappropriate speech). The PWS sample had significantly  higher factor I (P < 0.001) and factor V (P < 0.05) scores. The PWS sample had mean  scores above 1 for 17 ABC items; the contrast subjects had no mean scores above 1.  The factor I scores for the PWS sample were similar to those of inpatients in  hospital facilities for adults with mental retardation and mental illness or  severely challenging behaviour. The results support previous work, and extend it by  suggesting that temper tantrums, self-injury, impulsiveness, lability of mood,  inactivity and repetitive speech are characteristic behaviours in PWS in adult life.  Studies of the reasons for heterogeneity in behaviour are now needed.",

The same chromosomal abnormality was found in the proband's mother. The  inverted X chromosome was late replicating in all the mother's lymphocytes studied,  indicative of a likely unbalanced inversion. We show, by fluorescence in situ  hybridisation (FISH) using a panel of ordered yeast artificial chromosome (YAC)  clones, that the Xp breakpoint is localised in Xp11.23 between DXS146 and DXS255 and  that the Xq breakpoint is assigned to the X-Y homologous region in Xq21.3. YACs  crossing the Xp and Xq breakpoints have been identified. One of these two  breakpoints could be linked to the mental retardation in this patient as many  non-specific mental retardation (MRX) loci have previously been located in the  pericentromeric region of the X chromosome. Morever, the elucidation at the  molecular level of this rearrangement will also indicate if cleft palate or  prepubescent macro-orchidism, or both, in this boy are related to one of the two X  breakpoints.",

Using a photo-matching task, emotion recognition was tested in  children with Down syndrome, children with nonspecific intellectual disability and  cognitively matched, typically developing children (all groups N = 21) under four  conditions: veridical vs. exaggerated emotions and emotion-labelling vs. generic  task instructions. In all groups, exaggerating emotions facilitated recognition  accuracy and speed, with emotion labelling facilitating recognition accuracy.  Overall accuracy and speed did not differ in the children with Down syndrome,  although recognition of fear was poorer than in the typically developing children  and unrelated to emotion label use. Implications for interventions are considered.",

Peripheral  blood samples were cultured in either M199 or RPMI 1640 medium with FUdR or BrdU.  Metaphases were examined for chromosome lesions or fragile sites on the distal end  of Xq and 3 distinct sites were observed: Xq26, Xq27.2, and Xq27.3. Other chromosome  lesions at Xq28 were observed and interpreted as nonspecific telomeric structural  changes. Chromosome lesions were observed in cells from 14 of the 161 individuals.  These included: 5 patients with an Xq26 site, 2 with the recently reported Xq27.2  site, 4 with the Xq27.3 site (characteristic of the fra (X) syndrome), 2 with  nonspecific telomeric structural changes, and one individual with 2 lesions (a  nonspecific telomeric structural change and an Xq26 site). Additional research is  necessary to determine the frequency and clinical significance, if any, of lesions  occurring in this region of the X chromosome and to distinguish among heritable  fragile sites, constitutive fragile sites, and nonspecific telomeric structural  changes.",

        "Abstract": "Anxiety continues to be one of the most frequent disorders with typically developing  children and youth. However, people with intellectual disability (ID) lack validated  diagnostic tests backed by sufficient methodological rigor. Analyze the psychometric  properties of the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED) in  this clinical population, specifically in children and young Spanish with  Nonspecific Intellectual Disability. Descriptive statistics and item analysis  (N\u2009=\u2009542), exploratory factorial analysis (n\u2009=\u2009245) and confirmatory (n\u2009=\u2009297) and  scale reliability analyses were performed and evaluated the internal consistency  with various indices (Cronbach's alpha and omega) and the stability of the  measurement (test-retest) of the resulting scale with better goodness-of-adjustment  indices. A new scale called SCARED-DI was obtained in this clinical sample with  three factors and a smaller number of items (22), offering important goodness-of-fit  indices (RMSEA [95% CI] 03[0.01; .04]; CFI\u2009=\u20090.99; TLI\u2009=\u20090.98; GFI\u2009=\u20090.88;  AGFI\u2009=\u20090.89) and high internal consistency (\u03b1\u2009=\u20090.91; \u03c9\u2009=\u20090.93) and adequate  measurement stability (r(xx)\u2009=\u20090.92). The importance of validating  psychopathological anxiety tests for children and youth with ID in order to build  good mental health is discussed, emphasizing the need to provide easy,  short-duration tests on both cognitive and emotional aspects in this clinical  sub-population. In addition, the results are assessed in terms of future research  and practical implications. This new version of SCARED-ID represents a valid and  reliable tool to evaluate the anxiety in people with intellectual disabilities.",

Compared with the control males, there was  an increased frequency of radial loops, whorls, and arches on the fingers and of  third interdigital patterns and abnormal creases on the hands, and a decreased  frequency of ulnar loops and fourth interdigital patterns in the patients with the  fragile-X syndrome. The mean a-b ridge count was lower than in controls and there  were more patients than controls with an a-b ridge count less than 70. All of these  differences were significant at p less than 0.01. There was no differences between  patients and controls with respect to total ridge count on the fingers and the  dermatoglyphics in other areas of the hands or feet. From this small study a  preliminary index was developed that attempts to distinguish male patients with the  fragile-X syndrome from normal male controls and males with non-fragile-X forms of  mental retardation. The patterns on the left and right third fingers, the a-b ridge  count, and the palmar creases were used in the index. Sixty-four % of patients with  the fragile-X syndrome would be selected out if greater than or equal to + 0.5 was  used as the criterion and 90% of these males would be expected to have the fragile-X  chromosome.",

        "Title": "Linkage analysis suggests at least two loci for X-linked non-specific mental  retardation.",
        "Abstract": "Epidemiological studies have suggested that non-specific X-linked mental retardation  (XLMR) might be at least as frequent as the fragile X syndrome. The identification  of all mutations causing XLMR would thus appear of prime importance. In the absence  of other clinical signs the problem of genetic heterogeneity is acute. This can be  partly overcome by the analysis of large families. We have been able to perform  linkage analysis in 3 such families. The condition in family 1 was described as  clinically resembling the fra (X) syndrome by Proops et al [1983]: the kindred  includes 7 affected males in 3 sibships. Family 2 from Denmark has affected males in  4 generations; however, several affected relatives in this extended pedigree are  deceased. Family 3 from France counts 6 affected males in two sibships. The families  were analysed with about 25 X-linked markers. Linkage with markers in Xp22.2-p22.3  was found in family 1: z(theta) = 2.62 at theta = 0.06 for DXS85 (probe 782).  Suggestion of linkage was found in family 2 with both the Duchenne muscular  dystrophy region (DXS164 in Xp21.2) and with DXS1 (Xq11-q12). In family 3, DXS159  (Xq12-q13) gave a lod score of 2.53 at theta = 0; results were compatible with  localisation of the putative XLMR locus in this family proximal to DXYS1 (Xq21).  These data suggest that at least two non-specific XLMR loci could exist, one in Xp22  and the other in the q12-q13 region.",

        "Abstract": "Protein arginine methyltransferase 7 (PRMT7) is a member of a family of enzymes that  catalyze the transfer of methyl groups from S-adenosyl-l-methionine to nitrogen  atoms on arginine residues. Arginine methylation is involved in multiple biological  processes, such as signal transduction, mRNA splicing, transcriptional control, DNA  repair, and protein translocation. Currently, 10 patients have been described with  mutations in PRMT7. The shared findings include: hypotonia, intellectual disability,  short stature, brachydactyly, and mild dysmorphic features. We describe the  prenatal, postnatal, and pathological findings in two male sibs homozygote for a  mutation in PRMT7. Both had intrauterine growth restriction involving mainly the  long bones. In addition, eye tumor was found in the first patient, and nonspecific  brain calcifications and a systemic venous anomaly in the second. The pregnancy of  the first child was terminated and we describe the autopsy findings. The second  child had postnatal growth restriction of prenatal onset, hypotonia, strabismus,  sensorineural hearing loss, genitourinary and skeletal involvement, and global  developmental delay. He had dysmorphic features that included frontal bossing,  upslanting palpebral fissures, small nose with depressed nasal bridge, and pectus  excavatum. Our patients provide additional clinical and pathological data and expand  the phenotypic manifestations associated with PRMT7 homozygote/compound heterozygote  mutations to include brain calcifications and delayed myelination, and congenital  orbital tumor.",

        "Abstract": "A group of adolescents with Williams syndrome (WS) was compared to matched groups of  adolescents with Prader-Willi syndrome and nonspecific mental retardation on a task  that tested the ability to distinguish different forms of nonliteral language.  Participants listened to stories that ended in either a lie or an ironic joke. They  were asked to decide the form of the nonliteral utterance and justify their  responses. Almost none of the participants in any of the groups were able to  correctly classify the ironic jokes, instead judging them to be lies because they  did not correspond to reality. Their errors were similar to those made by younger  normally developing children, but contrasted with those made by brain-damaged  adults. These data are taken as further evidence that neurodevelopmental disorders  are quite different from acquired brain disorders and require different  neuropsychological models. The findings from this study also have important  implications for considering the difficulties that adolescents with WS and other  disorders will have in everyday social situations, especially among peers.",

        "Title": "Dropped head syndrome in severe intractable epilepsies with mental retardation.",
        "Abstract": "PURPOSE: Dropped head syndrome is characterized by a gradual forward sagging of the  head due to the isolated weakness of the neck extensor muscles. The syndrome has a  relatively benign clinical course. To date, there have been no reports of dropped  head syndrome in epileptic patients. METHODS: Nine patients with intractable  epilepsy (mean age, 33.6+/-9.91 years), each presenting with apparent dropped head,  were evaluated. The duration of the drooping head symptom varied from 3 to 15 years  (mean, 7.4+/-4.06 years), with a slowly progressing weakness in most of the  patients. In all of the patients, extensive clinical, laboratory,  electrophysiological, histopathological, and neuroimaging examinations were  performed. RESULTS: The weakness in all of the subjects was strictly limited to the  cervical paraspinal muscles. Laboratory studies produced normal results from all  subjects. EMG and muscle biopsy were normal or revealed subtle nonspecific myopathic  changes without inflammation in the cervical paraspinal muscles. Polymyographic  investigation revealed that none of the patients had convincing dystonic spasms of  the anterior neck muscles. No atrophy or fatty changes of the neck extensor muscles  were observed on CT or MRI. In most of the patients (7/9), altered L-carnitine  concentrations were observed (four patients displayed a marked decrease in plasma  carnitine concentrations, and three other patients showed abnormalities in urinary  excretion of carnitine). CONCLUSIONS: These findings seem to suggest that a  secondary carnitine deficiency, induced by antiepileptic drugs (principally valproic  acid), represents a plausible pathogenetic mechanism for the development of dropped  head in some epileptic patients.",

Molecular genetic analysis provides accurate diagnosis and facilitates  genetic counselling and prenatal testing. Screening for the fragile X mutation in a  sample of 3,888 individuals in Greece is reported: 1,755 children with non-specific  mental retardation, 1,733 parents and other family members and 400 normal  individuals. Molecular analysis allowed for the identification and characterization  of 52 fragile X families confirming the clinical diagnosis in 57 males and 4  females. Sixty-six female carriers (6 mentally retarded) and 4 normal transmitting  males were also identified. Four severely retarded males and their mothers carried  unmethylated premutations, while a moderately retarded girl had a deletion of  approximately equal to 150 bp. Overall sizing of the CGG repeat produced an allele  distribution of 6-58 CGG repeats (mean 28-30), similar to that in other Caucasian  populations.",

        "Title": "Is autosomal recessive Silver-Russel syndrome a separate entity or is it part of the  3-M syndrome spectrum?",
        "Abstract": "Intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) is a nonspecific finding that occurs in  approximately 0.17% of all live-births. However, IUGR can also be a significant  feature of many recognized genetic syndromes including Silver-Russel syndrome (SRS),  Three M syndrome (3-M), Dubowitz syndrome, and Mulibrey nanism. Differentiation of  3-M syndrome from autosomal recessive SRS has been difficult because of the  phenotypic variability of the latter. Limb length asymmetry is seen in over half of  those with autosomal recessive SRS, but not in individuals with 3-M syndrome.  Characteristic radiologic findings of 3-M syndrome are not present in SRS. We used  single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarrays to investigate the cause of  phenotypic features of SRS that shows autosomal recessive inheritance in three  consanguineous families, two from United Arab Emirates (UAE), and one from Jordan.  The mapped regions contained CUL7 and OBSL1, the genes that have recently been shown  to cause 3-M syndrome. Subsequently, direct DNA sequencing of CUL7 and OBSL1 genes  revealed novel mutations in both genes including two mutations in OBSL1 [c.1119G>C  (p.W373C) and c.681_682delinsTT (p.Q228X)], and a nonsense mutation in CUL7  [c.203G>A (p.W68X)]. In addition, a six nucleotide deletion in CUL7  [c.649_654delAGCCGC (p.217_218delSR)] was found in a consanguineous family from UAE  that had the typical features of 3-M. As a result of these findings, we question the  identity of the autosomal recessive SRS and suggest that all apparently recessive  SRS families should be tested for mutations in CUL7 and OBSL1.",

Immunohistochemically, the tumor was positive for calretinin, MIC-2  (CD99), S100 protein, PGP 9.5, and neuron-specific enolase. Electron microscopy of  the Sertoli cell tumor-like areas showed Charcot-Bottcher filaments, a  distinguishing feature of Sertoli cells. Together, these findings supported a  diagnosis of mixed sex cord-stromal tumor including granulosa cell tumor of adult  and juvenile types and intermediate- to high-grade Sertoli cell tumor, with large  areas of markedly atypical sex cord-stromal tumor.",

        "Abstract": "In this report, we describe two adult brothers affected by moderate non-specific  intellectual disability (ID). They showed minor facial anomalies, not clearly  ascribable to any specific syndromic patterns, microcephaly, brachydactyly and broad  toes. Both brothers presented seizures. Karyotype, subtelomeric and FMR1 analysis  were normal in both cases. We performed array-CGH analysis that revealed no  copy-number variations potentially associated with ID. Subsequent exome sequence  analysis allowed the identification of the ATRX c.109C>T (p.R37X) mutation in both  the affected brothers. Sanger sequencing confirmed the presence of the mutation in  the brothers and showed that the mother is a healthy carrier. Mutations in the ATRX  gene cause the X-linked alpha thalassemia/mental retardation (ATR-X) syndrome (MIM  #301040), a severe clinical condition usually associated with profound ID, facial  dysmorphism and alpha thalassemia. However, the syndrome is clinically heterogeneous  and some mutations, including the c.109C>T, are associated with a broad phenotypic  spectrum, with patients displaying a less severe phenotype with only mild-moderate  ID. In the case presented here, exome sequencing provided an effective strategy to  achieve the molecular diagnosis of ATR-X syndrome, which otherwise would have been  difficult to consider due to the mild non-specific phenotype and the absence of a  family history with typical severe cases.",

        "Abstract": "A high frequency of mutations in the methyl CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2) gene has  recently been reported in males with nonspecific X-linked mental retardation. The  results of this previous study suggested that the frequency of MECP2 mutations in  the mentally retarded population was comparable to that of CGG expansions in FMR1.  In view of these data, we performed MECP2 mutation analysis in a cohort of 475  mentally retarded males who were negative for FMR1 CGG repeat expansion. Five novel  changes, detected in seven patients, were predicted to change the MECP2 coding  sequence. Except for one, these changes were not found in a control population.  While this result appeared to suggest a high mutation rate, this conclusion was not  supported by segregation studies. Indeed, three of the five changes could be traced  in unaffected male family members. For another change, segregation analysis in the  family was not possible. Only one mutation, a frameshift created by a deletion of  two bases, was found to be de novo. This study clearly shows the importance of  segregation analysis for low frequency mutations, in order to distinguish them from  rare polymorphisms. The true frequency of MECP2 mutations in the mentally retarded  has probably been overestimated. Based on our data, the frequency of MECP2 mutations  in mentally retarded males is 0.2% (1/475).",

        "Abstract": "There is mounting evidence that children and adolescents with intellectual  disabilities (ID) of nonspecific aetiology perform poorer on phonological short-term  memory tasks than children matched for mental age indicating a structural deficit in  a process contributing to short-term recall of verbal material. One explanation is  that children with ID of nonspecific aetiology do not activate subvocal rehearsal to  refresh degrading memory traces. However, existing research concerning this  explanation is inconclusive since studies focussing on the word length effect (WLE)  as indicator of rehearsal have revealed inconsistent results for samples with ID and  because in several existing studies, it is unclear whether the WLE was caused by  rehearsal or merely appeared during output of the responses. We assumed that in  children with ID only output delays produce a small WLE while in typically  developing 6- to 8-year-olds rehearsal and output contribute to the WLE. From this  assumption we derived several predictions that were tested in an experiment  including 34 children with mild or borderline ID and 34 typically developing  children matched for mental age (MA). As predicted, results revealed a small but  significant WLE for children with ID that was significantly smaller than the WLE in  the control group. Additionally, for children with ID, a WLE was not found for the  first word of each trial but the effect emerged only in later serial positions. The  findings corroborate the notion that in children with ID subvocal rehearsal does not  develop in line with their mental age and provide a potential explanation for the  inconsistent results on the WLE in children with ID.",

        "Title": "MECP2 mutations or polymorphisms in mentally retarded boys: diagnostic implications.",
        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Among the well characterized X-linked conditions causing mental  retardation, mutations in the methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 gene (MECP2) in Xq28 have  been found in up to 85% of patients with Rett syndrome, a neurologic disorder which,  in addition to other symptoms, severely affects higher cognitive functions in  females. Mutations in the MECP2 gene are involved in a broad spectrum of phenotypes  from classical Rett syndrome to mild intellectual difficulties in females and  neonatal encephalopathy in males. Recently, mutations in the MECP2 gene were  reported in males with non-specific mental retardation suggesting that defects in  MECP2 could be responsible for up to 2% of X-linked mental retardation. METHODS: We  screened by denaturing high-pressure liquid chromatography the entire coding region  and flanking intronic sequences of the MECP2 gene in a cohort of 354 mentally  retarded males found negative for an expansion across the FRAXA CGG repeat and in a  family in which a boy and his sister were mentally retarded. RESULTS: We identified  mainly silent polymorphisms within the MECP2 gene, together with four sequence  alterations of unknown significance, i.e. three missense mutations (T197M, T228S,  and P376S) and one substitution at position -19 in intron 3 (378-19delT). Further  familial investigations allowed us to ruled out a pathogenic effect for the intronic  variant, the T228S and the P376S missense mutations. CONCLUSIONS: These results  confirm that MECP2 mutations in males are far more rare than initially thought and  call for a careful evaluation of the pathogenicity of the MECP2 missense mutations  identified in mentally retarded males before genetic counseling is proposed to the  relatives.",

In populations without intellectual disabilities, cognitive  behavioural therapy is a first line psychological therapy for these presentations.  There is no existing review of the range of methods and outcomes from intervention  studies in this area. METHOD: A systematic review was carried out following guidance  in the Cochrane handbook for systematic reviews of interventions. RESULTS: Nineteen  studies were identified. The majority of reports were descriptive case studies; the  most frequently described presentations were non-specific anxiety disorders and  post-traumatic stress disorder; the most frequently described cognitive techniques  were psycho-education and interventions directly aimed at thoughts and beliefs and  most studies reported positive outcomes, although the better controlled studies  tended to report less comprehensive impacts. CONCLUSIONS: A range of presentations  have been described although the area is still at a primarily descriptive stage. We  discuss intervention structures and approaches that require further research.",

        "Title": "Refining diagnoses: applying the DC-LD to an Irish population with intellectual  disability.",
        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The diagnostic criteria for psychiatric disorders for use with adults  with learning disabilities/mental retardation (DC-LD) is a diagnostic tool developed  in 2001 to improve upon existing classification systems for adults with learning  disability. The aim of this study was to apply the classification system described  by the DC-LD to a residential intellectual disability (ID) population to examine  whether it improved our diagnostic understanding of residents. METHODS: Chart  reviews of 113 of 178 people in a residential ID service were conducted. For each  resident, information was recorded according to the DC-LD multi-axial system. Each  resident's case was then discussed with a member of nursing staff familiar with the  resident. If diagnosis was unclear, the case was discussed with a senior clinical  psychiatrist. RESULTS: The percentage of residents with a moderate to profound ID  was 87.6%. In total, 94 diagnoses of psychiatric illness (Axis III, Level B, DC-LD)  were made. Of those 94 diagnoses, seven new diagnoses were found because of DC-LD  criteria. Of the total number of psychiatric diagnoses made, 72.3% were  non-specific, residual category diagnoses. A total of 79 residents (69.9%) had at  least one behaviour problem diagnosed on Axis III, Level D, Problem behaviours.  Fifty-six (49.6%) of residents in this sample had co-morbid epilepsy. CONCLUSIONS:  In people with moderate to profound learning disabilities, diagnosis continues to be  challenging. The DC-LD is a useful tool in helping to clarify diagnoses in this  population by providing revised criteria and a system to classify problem  behaviours. The DC-LD would be more helpful if specific axes were included to  document medical and psychosocial problems independently from other diagnoses.  Further research is warranted to determine whether the DC-LD hierarchical approach  to diagnosis improves diagnostic validity.",

Forty MRX patients  presented alleles within the intermediate range. Among them, one case showed a  pattern of expression of the FMR1 protein (FMRP) concordant with a fragile X  syndrome case with an intermediate allele/full mutation mosaicism, although it was  not detected by Southern blot analysis. Statistical analysis was performed again  showing no statistically significant difference regarding the intermediate allele  frequency in the MRX and control populations. This finding is in agreement with the  hypothesis that the incidence of intermediate FMR1 alleles in MRX populations does  not seem to be higher than in control populations, and it emphasizes the importance  of FMRP detection as a diagnostic tool for fragile X syndrome.",

        "Abstract": "Five folate-sensitive fragile sites have been characterized at the molecular level  (FRAXA, FRAXE, FRAXF, FRA16A and FRA11B). Three of them (FRAXA, FRAXE and FRA11B)  are associated with clinical problems, and two of the genes (FMR1 in FRAXA and CBL2  in FRA11B) have been identified. All of these fragile sites are associated with  (CCG)n/(CGG)n triplet expansions which are hypermethylated beyond a critical size.  FRAXE is a rare folate sensitive fragile site only recently recognized. Its  cytogenetic expression was found to involve the amplification of a (CCG)n repeat  adjacent to a CpG island. Normal alleles vary from 6 to 25 copies. Expansions of  greater than 200 copies were found in FRAXE expressing males and their FRAXE  associated CpG island was fully methylated. An association of FRAXE expression with  concurrent methylation of the CpG island and mild non-specific mental handicap in  males has been reported by several groups. We now report the cloning and  characterization of a gene (FMR2) adjacent to FRAXE. Elements of FMR2 were initially  identified from sequences deleted from a developmentally delayed boy. We correlate  loss of FMR2 expression with (CCG)n expansion at FRAXE, demonstrating that this is a  gene associated with the CpG island adjacent to FRAXE and contributes for  FRAXE-associated mild mental retardation.",

The main goal of this study was to  determine the smallest detectable difference (SDD) at 95% confidence of the  Preschool Imitation and Praxis Scale (PIPS) in preschoolers with intellectual  disabilities. Two raters independently scored videotapes of the imitation  performance of 44 preschoolers (27 with Down syndrome, 10 with Non-Specific Mental  Retardation and 7 with Low-functioning Autism) between 13 and 58 months of age (mean  age 39.6 months, SD 11.9 months). Results revealed that the PIPS demonstrated  acceptable interrater reliability on item level (weighted kappa values ranged from  0.52 to 0.96) and scale level (ICC = 0.986; 95% CI: 0.975-0.993). The SDD of the  PIPS was 7.2%, indicating that the change score rated by different raters for an  individual child with an intellectual disability is valid and that the PIPS can be  used by early interventionists and researchers as an outcome measure to determine  children's maturation or improvement.",

        "Title": "TBCK-related intellectual disability syndrome: Case study of two patients.",
        "Abstract": "There is a significant level of genetic heterogeneity underlying the phenotype of  nonspecific hypotonia with severe intellectual disability. Exome sequencing has  proven to be a powerful tool for identifying the underlying molecular basis of such  nonspecific, abnormal neurological phenotypes. Mutations in the TBCK gene have been  reported associated with very poor, if any, psychomotor development, poor speech,  and inability to walk independently. We describe the long-term phenotypic evolution  of a severe nonspecific neurodevelopmental disorder in two siblings born to an  Arab-Moslem family living in northern Israel. Exome sequencing led to identification  of a novel homozygous mutation: c.1854delT in the TBCK gene. Abnormal elevated \u03b2-HCG  was found in the maternal serum during the two pregnancies, a finding that has not  been reported before. These individuals present with severe intellectual disability,  no speech, hypotonia, convulsions, and lack of any independent daily skills. \u00a9 2016  Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Subtelomeric deletions of the long arm of chromosome 20 are rare, with  only 11 described in the literature. Clinical features of individuals with these  microdeletions include severe limb malformations, skeletal abnormalities, growth  retardation, developmental and speech delay, mental retardation, seizures and mild,  non-specific dysmorphic features. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We characterized  microdeletions at 20q13.33 in six individuals referred for genetic evaluation of  developmental delay, mental retardation, and/or congenital anomalies. A comparison  to previously reported cases of 20q13.33 microdeletion shows phenotypic overlap,  with clinical features that include mental retardation, developmental delay, speech  and language deficits, seizures, and behavior problems such as autistic spectrum  disorder. There does not appear to be a clinically recognizable constellation of  dysmorphic features among individuals with subtelomeric 20q microdeletions.  CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Based on genotype-phenotype correlation among individuals  in this and previous studies, we discuss several possible candidate genes for  specific clinical features, including ARFGAP1, CHRNA4 and KCNQ2 and  neurodevelopmental deficits. Deletion of this region may play an important role in  cognitive development.",

        "Abstract": "Recent human genetic approaches showed that mutations in three genes encoding OPHN1,  PAK3, and alphaPIX cause nonspecific X-linked mental retardation. These three  proteins act to modulate Rho GTPase signaling pathways and may participate in  neuronal morphogenesis by regulating the actin cytoskeleton. Here we showed that the  Oligophrenin-1 gene is expressed in the developing spinal cord and later in brain  areas that are characterized by high synaptic plasticity. At the cellular level  OPHN1 is expressed in both glial and neuronal cells where it colocalizes with actin,  notably at the tip of growing neurites. This interaction seems to be direct through  a novel uncharacterized domain in the carboxyl-terminal end of OPHN1. Overexpression  experiments in fibroblasts showed that the OPHN1 RhoGAP domain regulates in vivo the  actin cytoskeleton by inhibition of Rho pathways. Interestingly the amino-terminal  domain of OPHN1 inhibits the RhoGAP activity through an as yet unknown mechanism,  suggesting that OPHN1 may be tightly regulated in vivo.",

        "Title": "Genomic structural variants are linked with intellectual disability.",
        "Abstract": "Mutations in more than 500 genes have been associated with intellectual disability  (ID) and related disorders of cognitive function, such as autism and schizophrenia.  Here we aimed to unravel the molecular epidemiology of non-specific ID in a genetic  isolate using a combination of population and molecular genetic approaches. A large  multigenerational pedigree was ascertained within a Dagestan Genetic Heritage  research program in a genetic isolate of indigenous ethnics. Clinical  characteristics of the affected members were based on combining diagnoses from  regional psychiatric hospitals with our own clinical assessment, using a Russian  translation of the structured psychiatric interviews, the Diagnostic Interview for  Genetic Studies and the Family Interview for Genetic Studies, based on DSM-IV  criteria. Weber/CHLC 9.0 STRs set was used for multipoint parametric linkage  analyses (Simwalk2.91). Next, we checked CNVs and LOH (based on Affymetrix SNP 5.0  data) in the linked with ID genomic regions with the aim to identify candidate genes  associated with mutations in linked regions. The number of statistically significant  (p \u2264 0.05) suggestive linkage peaks with 1.3 < LOD < 3.0 we detected in a total of  10 genomic regions: 1q41, 2p25.3-p24.2, 3p13-p12.1, 4q13.3, 10p11, 11q23,  12q24.22-q24.31, 17q24.2-q25.1, 21q22.13 and 22q12.3-q13.1. Three significant  linkage signals with LOD >3 were obtained at 2p25.3-p24.2 under the dominant model,  with a peak at 21 cM flanked by loci D2S2976 and D2S2952; at 12q24.22-q24.31 under  the recessive model, with a peak at -120 cM flanked by marker D12S2070 and D12S395  and at 22q12.3 under the dominant model, with a peak at 32 cM flanked by marker  D22S683 and D22S445. After a set of genes had been designated as possible candidates  in these specific chromosomal regions,we conducted an exploratory search for LOH and  CNV based on microarray data to detect structural genomic variants within five  ID-linked regions with LOD scores between 2.0 and 3.9. In these selected regions we  obtained 173 ROH segments and 98 CN segments. Further analysis of region  2p25.3-p24.2 revealed deletions within genes encoding MYTL, SNTG2 and TPO among five  of 21 affected cases at 2p25.3-p24.2. In the ID-linked region at 12q24.22-12q24.31  19 out of 21 ID cases carried segmental CNV and 20 of 21 them displayed ROH segments  with mean size lengths for ID cases 2512 kb (500-6,472 kb) and for healthy control  682 kb (531-986 kb), including the genes MED13L, HRK, FBXW8, TESC, CDK2AP1 and  SBNO1. Seven of 21 affected pedigree members displayed segmental deletions at  22q12.3 that includes the gene LARGE. Eight affected pedigree members carried ROH  segments and 6 CN segments at 10p11.23-p11.21 containing the genes ZEB1, c10orf68  and EPC1. Our linkage and structural genomic variation analyses in a remote highland  genetic isolate with aggregation of ID demonstrated that even highly isolated single  kindred ID has oligo/polygenic pathogenesis. The results obtained implicate 10  genomic regions linked with ID that contain some of previously reported candidate  genes, including HRK, FBXW8, TESC, CDK2AP1 and SBNO1 at 12q24 that were shown in  recent studies as associated with brain measures derived from MRI scans.",

        "Abstract": "This study is the first to investigate the effectiveness of deep and shallow  intervention programs in the acquisition of visual metaphor comprehension in  individuals with non-specific intellectual disability (NSID; aged 15-59, N\u202f=\u202f53) or  Down syndrome (DS; aged 15-52, N\u202f=\u202f50). The deep intervention program was based on  dynamic assessment model for enhancing analogical thinking. The shallow intervention  program involves memorizing a metaphorical relationship between pairs of pictures.  Visual metaphor comprehension was measured by the construction of a metaphorical  connection between pairs of pictures. The results indicated that both etiology  groups exhibited poor understanding of visual metaphors before the intervention. A  significant improvement was observed in both interventions and both etiology groups,  with greater improvement among individuals who underwent the deep processing.  Moreover, the latter procedure led to greater generalization ability. The results  also indicated that vocabulary contributed significantly to understanding unstudied  metaphors and that participants with poorer linguistic abilities exhibited greater  improvement in their metaphorical thinking. Thus, individuals with ID with or  without DS are able to recruit the higher-order cognitive abilities required for  visual metaphor comprehension.",

        "Abstract": "This study was undertaken to determine whether prenatal exposure to influenza  epidemics increases the risk of mental handicap. The monthly birth frequencies of  827 first-admission individuals (mean age at admission 13 years) with a primary  diagnosis of non-specific mental retardation, discharged from psychiatric hospitals  in England and Wales, were examined in relation to the monthly death rates from  influenza over the period 1953-1980. The relative risk of developing mental handicap  when exposed to influenza epidemics during mid-gestation was assessed by a  generalized linear model. Increased death rates from influenza, a measure of  prevalence of the infection, were significantly associated with an increase in  births of mentally handicapped individuals 6 months later. For every 1000 female  deaths from influenza there was a 17% increase in births of mentally handicapped  individuals 6 months later. Maternal exposure to influenza at approximately the  third to fourth month of gestation may be risk factor for developing mental  handicap.",

        "Abstract": "We describe a 59-year-old male (patient A059) with moderate to severe mental  retardation (MR) and a pericentric inversion of the X-chromosome:  inv(X)(p21.1;q22.1). He had short stature, pectus excavatum, general muscle wasting,  and facial dysmorphism. Until now, no other patients with similar clinical features  have been described in the literature. Molecular analysis of both breakpoints led to  the identification of a novel \"Nuclear RNA export factor\" (NXF) gene cluster on  Xq22.1. Within this cluster, the NXF5 gene was interrupted with subsequent loss of  gene expression. Hence, mutation analysis of the NXF5 and its neighboring homologue,  the NXF2 gene was performed in 45 men with various forms of syndromic X-linked MR  (XLMR) and in 70 patients with nonspecific XLMR. In the NXF5 gene four nucleotide  changes: one intronic, two silent, and one missense (K23E), were identified. In the  NXF2 gene two changes (one intronic and one silent) were found. Although none of  these changes were causative mutations, we propose that NXF5 is a good candidate  gene for this syndromic form of XLMR, given the suspected role of NXF proteins is  within mRNA export/transport in neurons. Therefore, mutation screening of the NXF  gene family in phenotypically identical patients is recommended.",

        "Abstract": "We describe a mother and two sons with a 6-Mb terminal deletion of the short arm of  the X chromosome. The breakpoint was localized to a region between DXS6837 and  sAJ243947 in Xp22.33. The two boys were shown to be deleted for the SHOX and ARSE  genes on their X chromosome. Both sons were short in stature and showed mild to  moderate skeletal abnormalities. The most significant findings in the younger son  were severe learning disabilities and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder  (ADHD). The older son tested in the mild mental retardation range and was also  affected by ADHD. The VCX-A gene, implicated recently in X-linked nonspecific mental  retardation, was found to be present in both boys. The mother's stature was greater  than one standard deviation below her target height and she had only subtle  radiographic evidence of Madelung deformity. Our findings indicate that loss of the  Xp22.3 region is not always associated with the classic presentations of L\u00e9ri-Weill  syndrome, or chondrodysplasia punctata, and that one or more genes involved in  learning and attention may reside in Xp22.3.",

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Children with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS) have been reported  to have high rates of cognitive and psychiatric problems. AIMS: To establish the  nature and prevalence of psychiatric disorder and neurocognitive impairment in  children with 22q11.2DS and test whether risk of psychopathology is mediated by the  children's intellectual impairment. METHOD: Neurocognition and psychopathology were  assessed in 80 children with 22q11.2DS (mean age 10.2 years, s.d. = 2.1) and 39  sibling controls (mean age 10.9 years, s.d. = 2.0). RESULTS: More than half (54%) of  children with 22q11.2DS met diagnostic criteria for one or more DSM-IV-TR  psychiatric disorder. These children had lower IQ (mean 76.8, s.d. = 13.0) than  controls (mean 108.6, s.d. = 15.2) (P<0.001) and showed a range of neurocognitive  impairments. Increased risk of psychopathology was not mediated by intellectual  impairment. CONCLUSIONS: 22q11.2DS is not related to a specific psychiatric  phenotype in children. Moreover, the deletion has largely independent effects on IQ  and risk of psychopathology, indicating that psychopathology in 22q11.2DS is not a  non-specific consequence of generalised cognitive impairment.",

The system  includes a flatbed scanner for the entry of photographs and text, additional memory  to enhance resolution of photographs, and several programs which facilitate searches  for keywords. The primary advantages of the system include an easy interaction  between descriptive words and photographs, and rapid comparison of whole faces and  specific traits from many individuals. Information within families and between  disorders can easily be compared in coded or uncoded fashion. Data from the 34  currently described syndromes emerging from the category of \"non-specific XLMR\" are  being used to develop and test this approach. Neither standard photographs nor most  computerized diagnostic systems permit this flexibility. Ultimately, this approach  will provide a valuable diagnostic and teaching aid.",

        "Abstract": "We report on deletion mapping and X inactivation analysis of a gene for X linked  non-specific mental retardation (MRX) at Xp21.3-Xp22.11, on the basis of molecular  studies in two families with Xp microdeletions involving the DAX-1 gene. In family  A, mental retardation (MR) was profound in the older brother with an episode of  adrenal crisis, severe in the younger brother with no episode of adrenal crisis, and  mild to moderate in the sister and the mother with no signs of adrenal hypoplasia.  In family B, MR was absent in the male patient with adrenal hypoplasia. Polymerase  chain reaction for 16 loci in the middle of Xp showed that the brothers of family A  had a small Xp deletion between DXS7182 and DXS1022, and that the patient of family  B had a tiny Xp deletion between DXS319 and DXS1022. Microsatellite analysis for  tetranucleotide repeats in the promoter region of the DAX-1 gene and Southern  blotting for DAX-1 and DXS28 showed that the sister and the mother of family A were  heterozygous for the interstitial deletion. X inactivation analysis for the  methylation status of the AR gene and the HPRT gene indicated that the normal X and  the deleted X chromosome underwent random X inactivation in both the sister and the  mother. The results imply that an MRX gene subject to X inactivation is present in a  roughly 4 Mb region between DXS7182 and DAX-1, and that reduced expression of the  normal MRX gene caused by random X inactivation results in MR in carrier females.",

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The genetic etiology of intellectual and psychomotor disability without  a defined spectrum of dysmorphic features is usually monogenic. As no diagnostic  criteria for such diseases are established, the clinical diagnosis becomes to be a  challenge. The object of our paper is to present two patients with non-specific  clinical symptoms for whom whole-exome-sequencing identified the new SON mutations  and thus allowed for establishing the diagnosis of Zhu-Tokita-Takenouchi-Kim (ZTTK)  syndrome. In both patients, the same symptoms including hypotonia, developmental and  speech delay, feeding difficulties as well as frequent infections of the respiratory  tract and internal ear were observed. However, both cases presented also with  exceptional symptoms such as in case 1 ventriculomegaly and asymmetry of ventricles,  hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS), intellectual disability, intestinal  malrotation, gastroparesis, and duodenal atresia and in the case 2 febrile seizures  and reduced IgA levels. We will be presenting the patients and comparing them to 30  previously described cases. METHODS: Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed on  the probands' DNA and paired-end sequenced (2x100\u00a0bp) on HiSeq 1500. Variants  considered as disease-causing were validated in the proband and studied in all  available family members by amplicon deep sequencing performed using Nextera XT Kit  and sequenced on HiSeq 1500. RESULTS: We have identified two new variants in SON  gene. In case 1 it has been a heterozygous frameshift variant p.(Ala1340GlnfsTer26),  while in case 2 it has been a heterozygous frameshift variant, p.(Asp1640GlyfsTer7).  Both variants are described for the first time and up to now, are not mentioned in  any database. CONCLUSION: As there are no precise criteria established for the  clinical diagnosis of ZTTK, an identification of SON gene mutation by  whole-exome-sequencing is the best method that allows for a diagnosis of this  syndrome.",

        "Abstract": "The GDI1 gene, responsible in human for X-linked non-specific mental retardation,  encodes alphaGDI, a regulatory protein common to all GTPases of the Rab family. Its  alteration, leading to membrane accumulation of different Rab GTPases, may affect  multiple steps in neuronal intracellular traffic. Using electron microscopy and  electrophysiology, we now report that lack of alphaGDI impairs several steps in  synaptic vesicle (SV) biogenesis and recycling in the hippocampus. Alteration of the  SV reserve pool (RP) and a 50% reduction in the total number of SV in adult synapses  may be dependent on a defective endosomal-dependent recycling and may lead to the  observed alterations in short-term plasticity. As predicted by the synaptic  characteristics of the mutant mice, the short-term memory deficit, observed when  using fear-conditioning protocols with short intervals between trials, disappeared  when the Gdi1 mutants were allowed to have longer intervals between sessions.  Likewise, previously observed deficits in radial maze learning could be corrected by  providing less challenging pre-training. This implies that an intact RP of SVs is  necessary for memory processing under challenging conditions in mice. The  possibility to correct the learning deficit in mice may have clinical implication  for future studies in human.",

        "Title": "CALL interrupted in a patient with non-specific mental retardation: gene  dosage-dependent alteration of murine brain development and behavior.",
        "Abstract": "Investigation of MR patients with 3p aberrations led to the identification of the  translocation breakpoint in intron five of the neural Cell Adhesion L1-Like (CALL or  CHL1) gene in a man with non-specific mental retardation and 46,Y,  t(X;3)(p22.1;p26.3). The Xp breakpoint does not seem to affect a known or predicted  gene. Moreover, a fusion transcript with the CALL gene could not be detected and no  mutations were identified on the second allele. CALL is highly expressed in the  central and peripheral nervous system, like the mouse ortholog 'close homolog to L1'  (Chl1). Chl1 expression levels in the hippocampus of Chl1(+/-) mice were half of  those obtained in wild-type littermates, reflecting a gene dosage effect. Timm  staining and synaptophysin immunohistochemistry of the hippocampus showed focal  groups of ectopic mossy fiber synapses in the lateral CA3 region, outside the  trajectory of the infra-pyramidal mossy fiber bundle in Chl1(-/-) and Chl1(+/-)  mice. Behavioral assessment demonstrated mild alterations in the Chl1(-/-) animals.  In the probe trial of the Morris Water Maze test, Chl1(-/-) mice displayed an  altered exploratory pattern. In addition, these mice were significantly more  sociable and less aggressive as demonstrated in social exploration tests. The  Chl1(+/-) mice showed a phenotypic spectrum ranging from wild-type to knockout  behavior. We hypothesize that a 50% reduction of CALL expression in the developing  brain results in cognitive deficits. This suggests that the CALL gene at 3p26.3 is a  prime candidate for an autosomal form of mental retardation. So far, mutation  analysis of the CALL gene in patients with non-specific MR did not reveal any  disease-associated mutations.",

The same  chromosomal abnormalities were found in their mothers who are intellectually normal.  Fluorescence in situ hybridisation mapping showed a common area of breakage of each  of the inverted chromosomes in Xq13.1 near DXS131 and DXS162. A detailed long range  restriction map of the breakpoint region was constructed using YAC, PAC, and cosmid  clones. We show that the two inverted chromosomes break within a short 250 kb  region. Moreover, a group of ESTs corresponding to an as yet uncharacterised gene  was mapped to the same critical interval. We hypothesise that the common inversion  breakpoint region of the two cases in Xq13.1 may contain a new MRX gene.",

        "Abstract": "We analyzed our two new cases of infantile-onset epilepsy with developmental delay  with de novo variant in TUBB2A and review the related literatures. Our two probands  were both girls with infantile-onset epilepsy and global developmental delay. Case 1  had a novel de novo heterozygous missense variant: c.728C>T [p.Pro243Leu]  (NM_001069.2). Her brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed nonspecific white  matter myelination delay and slightly enlarged anterior horn of lateral ventricle.  Her epilepsy had been controlled by TPM monotherapy. Case 2 had a reported de novo  variant c.743C>T [p.Ala248Val] (NM_001069.2). Her brain MRI showed bilateral  microgyria and corpus callosum dysplasia. A total of seven TUBB2A mutations cases  had been published previously in five papers, therefore, until now, there were nine  patients with TUBB2A mutations. All patients had developmental delay, among them  seven cases also with infantile-onset epilepsy, one case with abnormal EEG but  without clinical seizures. There are six cases that have different degree of  cortical dysplasia, one case with cerebellar vermis atrophy and brainstem  sacsinopathy, the rest two cases have no obvious brain structural abnormalities.  There was one case with variant c.1249G>A (p.D417N) that had atypical clinical  presentation, including prominent progressive spastic ataxia, sensory motor axonal  neuropathy, and bilateral optic macular dystrophy, but relatively mild intellectual  disability, his MRI showed cerebellar atrophy, thinning of the corpus callosum and  pons sacsinopathy, but no cortical malformation. The p.A248V mutation was the most  common mutation occurred in three patients (3/9). The clinical phenotypes of these  three patients were similar, all of them had global developmental delay with no  language and corpus callosum dysplasia, two cases with epilepsy and the other one  only have EEG epileptic discharges without clinical seizure, two cases with cortical  dysplasia and the other one without obvious brain malformation. In brief, global  developmental delay was the most common phenotype of TUBB2A mutation-related  disease, most cases also had infantile-onset epilepsy and cortical dysplasia and  corpus callosum dysplasia. The region between seventh and eighth alpha-helix of  TUBB2A may be a \"hot spot\" mutation domain.",

        "Abstract": "In 1986, a population study of school children in the city of Coventry gave an  overall prevalence in males and females for fragile X syndrome of 1/952. The 29  children diagnosed as having fragile X syndrome in this study have been re-evaluated  with molecular diagnostic techniques. Eighteen of the original 29 children have been  found not to have the expansion of the FMR1 gene associated with fragile X syndrome.  Revised prevalence figures have been calculated giving rise to an overall prevalence  figure of 1/2720 (range 1/2198-1/3089). If the four children lost to follow up are  also assumed not to have the fragile X syndrome, the revised prevalence figure was  1/5714 (range 1/4762-1/6349). Clinical review of boys with severe mental retardation  from this and a subsidiary study show that the clinical features of head  circumference greater than the 50th centile, testicular volume greater than the 50th  centile, and IQ between 35 and 70 remain helpful in distinguishing boys with fragile  X syndrome from those who have non-specific mental retardation.",

        "Title": "Intellectual disability without epilepsy associated with STXBP1 disruption.",
        "Abstract": "STXBP1 (Munc18-1) is a component of the machinery involved in the fusion of  secretory vesicles to the presynaptic membrane for the release of neurotransmitters.  De novo missense mutations in STXBP1 were recently reported in patients with  Ohtahara syndrome, a form of encephalopathy with severe early-onset epilepsy. In  addition, sequencing of the coding region of STXBP1 in 95 patients with  non-syndromic intellectual disability (NSID) revealed de novo truncating mutations  in two patients who also showed severe non-specific epilepsy, suggesting that STXBP1  disruption has the potential of causing a wide spectrum of epileptic disorders in  association with intellectual disability. Here, we report on the mutational  screening of STXBP1 in a different series of 50 patients with NSID and the  identification of a novel de novo truncating mutation (c.1206delT/ p.Y402X) in a  male with NSID, but surprisingly with no history of epilepsy. This is the first  report of a patient with a truncating mutation in STXBP1 that does not show  epilepsy, thus, expanding the clinical spectrum associated with STXBP1 disruption.",

        "Abstract": "We present the case of a 51-year-old patient with a 31-year history of psychiatric  symptoms, craniocervical dystonia, bulbar dysfunction, and parkinsonism. His  dystonic movements included blepharospasm, jaw opening and lingual dystonia, and  spasmodic retrocollis. Psychiatric symptoms included psychosis and depression, with  onset years before the movement disorder. After his death by aspiration, examination  of his brain revealed abnormalities limited to the neostriatum. Staining of brain  sections, including Holzer, glial fibrillary acidic protein, and immunohistochemical  stain for calbindin D28k, revealed the presence of a mosaic pattern of gliosis with  neuronal loss (sparing large neurons) within this region. The islands of tissue  between stands of gliosis had a normal appearance. This patient represents only the  fourth case (and first North American born) with a mosaic pattern of gliosis in the  neostriatum. The clinical and pathologic features were similar in all four cases  except that our patient was the first with prominent psychiatric symptoms and a more  stable, less progressive course. Mosaicism has been described in the X-linked  Filipino disorder Lubag. Occurrence in non-Filipino patients, such as ours, suggest  that either Lubag can develop in non-Filipino families or that mosaicism is a  nonspecific pathologic finding in some patients with idiopathic dystonia. Finally,  our case reports the notion that craniocervical dystonia may result from neostriatal  dysfunction.",

This nested qualitative study from a larger trial  explored supporters' experiences of supporting people with intellectual disabilities  receiving behavioural activation or guided self-help therapies for depression.  METHOD: Twenty-one purposively sampled supporters were interviewed. The  semi-structured interviews were subject to framework analysis, covering expectations  of therapy, views of therapy sessions, relationships with therapist and participant,  and perceived changes. RESULTS: Supporters were positive about both therapies and  reported both therapy-specific and nonspecific therapeutic factors that had  significant positive impacts on people's lives. Most supporters reported their  involvement contributed to the interventions' effectiveness, and helped establish  closer relationships to the people they were supporting. CONCLUSIONS: The presence  of supporters within psychological therapies for people with intellectual  disabilities can be an effective adaptation to therapies for this population.",

A putative pseudoautosomal gene affecting height and an  X-linked non-specific mental retardation gene have been tentatively assigned to  specific intervals.

As a rule 50 cells, cultured in  folate-deficient medium were analysed. The results are compared with data collected  from the literature and with the data expected from prior genetic risks and fra(X)  penetrance. If no more than 50 cells were analysed, the fragile site was found in a  lower than expected proportion (69.2%) of the retarded first-degree male relatives.  The conclude that in a substantial number of unselected patients with mental  retardation the diagnosis fra(X) syndrome will only be confirmed cytogenetically if  at least 100 cells are analysed. Five percent of the male and 10% of the female  index patients showed a fragile X-like abnormality, probably not associated with the  Martin-Bell syndrome.",

        "Abstract": "Children receiving ESN(S) education, attending special day schools, and living at  home, were categorized into those whose handicap had been medically recognized in  infancy and those of unknown aetiology, 'non-specific'. Information obtained from  interviews with their families was used to identify a subgroup of those who were  relatively socially disadvantaged. Both factors, medical and social, are shown to  have a significant effect on early provisions for special needs. The non-specific  cases from disadvantaged families tended to have been recognized at a later age than  the rest; their parents had less information, less access to services, and less  contact with others who could provide aid and support. It is argued that the  theoretical model which distinguishes pathogenic and subcultural aetiologies of  severe mental subnormality is inappropriate. It may be wrongly applied by  fieldworkers, especially those serving families with a developmentally backward  preschool child. The result may discriminate against socially disadvantaged families  with a child whose handicap is not medically diagnosed.",

        "Title": "Hearing impairment as an early sign of alpha-mannosidosis in children with a mild  phenotype: Report of seven new cases.",
        "Abstract": "Alpha-mannosidosis (AM) is a very rare (prevalence: 1/500000 births) autosomal  recessive lysosomal storage disorder. It is characterized by multi-systemic  involvement associated with progressive intellectual disability, hearing loss,  skeletal anomalies, and coarse facial features. The spectrum is wide, from very  severe and lethal to a milder phenotype that usually progresses slowly. AM is caused  by a deficiency of lysosomal alpha-mannosidase. A diagnosis can be established by  measuring the activity of lysosomal alpha-mannosidase in leucocytes and screening  for abnormal urinary excretion of mannose-rich oligosaccharides. Genetic  confirmation is obtained with the identification of MAN2B1 mutations. Enzyme  replacement therapy (LAMZEDE(R) ) was approved for use in Europe in August 2018.  Here, we describe seven individuals from four families, diagnosed at 3-23\u2009years of  age, and who were referred to a clinical geneticist for etiologic exploration of  syndromic hearing loss, associated with moderate learning disabilities. Exome  sequencing had been used to establish the molecular diagnosis in five cases,  including a two-sibling pair. In the remaining two patients, the diagnosis was  obtained with screening of urinary oligosaccharides excretion and the association of  deafness and hypotonia. These observations emphasize that the clinical diagnosis of  AM can be challenging, and that it is likely an underdiagnosed rare cause of  syndromic hearing loss. Exome sequencing can contribute significantly to the early  diagnosis of these nonspecific mild phenotypes, with advantages for treatment and  management.",

GDI1 patients are impaired in specific  aspects of executive functions and conditioned response, which are controlled by  fronto-striatal circuitries. Previous molecular and behavioral characterization of  the Gdi1-null mouse revealed alterations in the total number/distribution of  hippocampal and cortical synaptic vesicles as well as hippocampal short-term  synaptic plasticity, and memory deficits. In this study, we employed cognitive  protocols with high translational validity to human condition that target the  functionality of cortico-striatal circuitry such as attention and stimulus selection  ability with progressive degree of complexity. We previously showed that Gdi1-null  mice are impaired in some hippocampus-dependent forms of associative learning  assessed by aversive procedures. Here, using appetitive-conditioning procedures we  further investigated associative learning deficits sustained by the fronto-striatal  system. We report that Gdi1-null mice are impaired in attention and associative  learning processes, which are a key part of the cognitive impairment observed in  XLID patients.",

Studies using electroencephalographic  methods have been fraught with subject sampling bias, a lack of standardized  techniques and measures, and a lack of appropriate control groups. Low-functioning  autistic children with age-matched normals, age-matched mentally handicapped, and  mentally age-matched normal toddlers were tested using a computerized  electroencephalographic technique. The autistic children showed significantly more  slow wave activity and less alpha, as well as less inter- and intrahemispheric  asymmetry than either normal or mentally handicapped children. In general,  electroencephalographic features of autistic children closely resembled those of the  toddlers, supporting a model of maturational lag as the key descriptor for autistic  CNS functioning. A model of diminished cortical differentiation is proposed to  account for the low level of intellectual functioning.",

        "Abstract": "Clinical patterns, aetiological factors and utilization of services were studied in  40 families who had more than one handicapped child. By retrospective review of the  case notes and interviewing consenting parents (90%), data relating to diagnosis,  investigations, genetic counselling, social circumstances and help received were  obtained. Both children had the same disorder in 31 families, however in only nine  of these families did the children have a specific diagnosis. Non-specific mental  retardation was the commonest disorder (40 children). Of the 673 special  investigations performed, only 14 were diagnostic. Genetic counselling had been  given to only 19 families. Thirty-two of the families had remained as stable units  and of the children, 51 received attendance allowances and 21 had periods of respite  care. The implications of these findings are discussed.",

        "Abstract": "Members of the Rho GTPase family are key regulatory molecules that link surface  receptors to the organization of the actin cytoskeleton. It is now well established  that these small GTPases are also crucial for neuronal morphogenesis and  connectivity. Moreover, mutations in ARHGEF6 (also known as alphaPIX or Cool-2 ),  encoding a Rac1/Cdc42-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor, have been  implicated in X-linked mental retardation. In an attempt to get insight into the  biological function of ARHGEF6 and the upstream signaling cascades leading to its  activation, we used the full-length coding region of ARHGEF6 as bait in yeast-two  hybrid screens and identified PARVB (beta-parvin or affixin) as a novel binding  partner. The interaction was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down.  We showed by immunofluorescence that ARHGEF6 and PARVB co-localize at the cell  periphery to lamellipodia and ruffles in well-spread and actively spreading cells  adhered to fibronectin. In addition, interaction of ARHGEF6 to ARHGEF7 (betaPIX or  Cool-1), a close homolog of ARHGEF6, was confirmed. In in vivo assays, two ARHGEF6  mutations identified previously in patients with X-linked non-specific mental  retardation, ARHGEF6 deltaaa56-83 and deltaaa396-776, abolished interaction of  ARHGEF6 to PARVB. Binding between ARHGEF6 and ARHGEF7 was not affected by ARHGEF6  deltaaa56-83 but did not occur with ARHGEF6 deltaaa396-776. These data suggest that  both the N-terminal calponin homology (CH) and C-terminal coiled-coil domains are  necessary for the ARHGEF6-PARVB binding. In contrast, it seems that only the  coiled-coil domain is required for the interaction and heterodimerization of ARHGEF6  and ARHGEF7. PARVB is known to interact with integrin-linked kinase (ILK) and is  involved in the early stage of cell-substrate interaction through integrins. The  identification of PARVB as an ARHGEF6 interacting partner together with the  co-localization of ARHGEF6 and ILK in spreading cells suggest that ARHGEF6 is  involved in integrin-mediated signaling leading to activation of the GTPases Rac1  and/or Cdc42.",

According to the biological dissociation model, the right hemisphere  (RH) mediates speech perception and the left hemisphere (LH) mediates motor control  in Down syndrome. The current study aimed to test, for the first time, brain  lateralization in both non-specific intellectual disability and Down syndrome,  compared to individuals with typical development. Furthermore, bilateral word  presentation was utilized to assess interhemispheric communication. Twenty adults  with non-specific intellectual disability, 14 adults with Down syndrome, and 30  adults with typical development participated in the study. Participants in the  non-specific intellectual disability and Down syndrome groups were trained to  perform the task prior to the experiment. The results showed that whereas  hemispheric lateralization did not differ between individuals with non-specific  intellectual disability and typical development, individuals with DS showed reduced  brain lateralization in comparison to adults with typical development. All three  groups showed no significant difference between words presented to the LH and  bilaterally. Our results also show that individuals with intellectual disabilities  can benefit from training programmes and that they may perform equally as fast as  their typically developing peers.",

Consanguineous families constitute a rich resource for  the identification of rare variants causing autosomal recessive disease, due to the  effects of inbreeding. Here, we examine three consanguineous Arab families,  recruited in a quest to identify novel genes/mutations. All the families had  multiple offspring with non-specific intellectual disability. We identified  homozygosity (autozygosity) intervals in those families through SNP genotyping and  whole exome sequencing, with variants filtered using Ingenuity Variant Analysis  (IVA) software. The families showed heterogeneity and novel mutations in three  different genes known to be associated with intellectual disability. These mutations  were not found in 514 ethnically matched control chromosomes. p.G410C in WWOX,  p.H530Y in RARS2, and p.I69F in C10orf2 are novel changes that affect protein  function and could give new insights into the development and function of the  central nervous system.",

Fragile X E is  associated with X-linked non-specific mild intellectual disability (ID) and with  behavioral problems. Most of the known genetic causes of ASD are also causes of ID,  implying that these two identities share common genetic bases. We present a child  with an ASD with a normal range of intelligence quotient, that later evolved to  compulsive behavior. FRAXE locus analysis by polymerase chain reaction revealed a  complete mutation of the FMR 2 gene. This report stresses the importance of  clinicians being aware of the association between a full mutation of FMR2 and ASD  associated with compulsive behavior despite normal intellectual level.",

        "Abstract": "The present study aimed to assess the psychometric proprieties of a new social  adaptive skills questionnaire and examine the impact of maladaptive behaviour on  social functioning in adults with ID of non-specific aetiology and those with Down  syndrome. The results of an exploratory factor analysis led to the exclusion of 20  items out of 48 and yielded a four-factor structure. The Confirmatory Factor  Analysis conducted on 28 remaining items confirmed a four-factor structure  explaining 43% of the total variance. The results computed on the global sample  (n\u2009=\u2009567) showed a \"very good\" internal consistency for the global score (.89) for  all four factors with a very good fit (.97). Thus, this new assessment tool  presented a good conceptual validity for assessing social-adaptive skills in adults  with ID. The results also showed that participants with DS (no\u2009=\u200992) exhibited a  higher global score of social adaptive skills on three subscales (sociability,  social relating and respect for social rules) compared to adults with ID of  non-specific aetiology (no\u2009=\u2009328), and presented a lower level of psychopathology  problems. Although aetiology was significantly related to these group differences  even after controlling for level of ID and chronological age, the general level of  psychopathology fully mediated these relations. In conclusion, the regression  coefficient analyses showed that the general level of psychopathology fully mediated  the relationship between aetiology and social adaptive skills. A combined assessment  of these dimensions should provide information about their predictive value for  social functioning in ID adults and target specific remediation goals.",

Apart from the  hematologic abnormality, the other universal clinical finding is mild to moderate  mental handicap; there is also a broad spectrum of associated dysmorphic features.  Initial analysis of the alpha globin gene complex (which maps to chromosome band  16p13.3), demonstrated that the alpha thalassemia results from failure of the  patient to inherit an alpha globin allele from one of the parents. Using a combined  molecular and cytogenetic approach, we have extended this analysis to show that all  of these patients have 16p deletions which are variable in extent but limited to the  terminal band 16p13.3; in at least four cases the deletion results from unbalanced  chromosome translocation, and hence aneuploidy of a second chromosome is also  present. The relatively nonspecific clinical phenotype contrasts with the other  currently known microdeletion syndromes; this may reflect ascertainment bias in the  recognition of such syndromes. This work represents the first step in the  characterization of a new microdeletion syndrome that is probably underdiagnosed at  present.",

        "Title": "Differentiating care for persons with mild intellectual disability or borderline  intellectual functioning: a Delphi study on the opinions of primary and professional  caregivers and scientists.",
        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The demand for support for persons with mild intellectual disability or  borderline intellectual functioning is growing rapidly. These persons often  encounter individual and familial limitations that influence their human  functioning, and often have difficulty coping with the demands of modern society.  Although in the areas of policy, research and practice, people with mild  intellectual disability or borderline intellectual functioning are generally  approached as one group, important differences between them have been reported.  Current support seems to be both suboptimal and insufficiently differentiated.  METHODS: In this Delphi study we aimed to explore the need for appropriate and  differentiated support for individuals with mild intellectual disability or  borderline intellectual functioning. The study was based on five unique profiles of  persons with mild intellectual disability or borderline intellectual functioning  that are associated with individual and environmental variables. The opinions of  expert primary caregivers, professional caregivers and scientists were analysed for  potentially appropriate types of support for each of the five profiles. RESULTS: A  total of 174 statements, divided over the five profiles, were presented to the  participants. For 74 statements, consensus was reached between the expert groups.  For each profile, these consensual statements represented specific items (e.g.  concrete personal goals) and non-specific items (e.g. the attitude towards persons  with mild intellectual disability or borderline intellectual functioning, and the  coordination of health care) related to the support needs. CONCLUSION: This  Delphi-based study generated consensual opinions contributing to a more  differentiated system of support for individuals with mild intellectual disability  or borderline intellectual functioning. Although these findings need additional  investigation, they address actions that might enhance the support programmes for  these individuals into more personalized support.",

        "Abstract": "Despite well-documented attention deficits in children with intellectual and  developmental disabilities (IDD), distinctions across types of attention problems  and their association with academic attainment has not been fully explored. This  study examines visual attention capacities and inattentive/hyperactive behaviours in  77 children aged 4 to 11\u00a0years with IDD and elevated behavioural attention  difficulties. Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD; n\u00a0=\u00a023), Down syndrome  (DS; n\u00a0=\u00a022), and non-specific intellectual disability (NSID; n\u00a0=\u00a032) completed  computerized visual search and vigilance paradigms. In addition, parents and  teachers completed rating scales of inattention and hyperactivity. Concurrent  associations between attention abilities and early literacy and numeracy skills were  also examined. Children completed measures of receptive vocabulary, phonological  abilities and cardinality skills. As expected, the results indicated that all groups  had relatively comparable levels of inattentive/hyperactive behaviours as rated by  parents and teachers. However, the extent of visual attention deficits varied as a  result of group; namely children with DS had poorer visual search and vigilance  abilities than children with ASD and NSID. Further, significant associations between  visual attention difficulties and poorer literacy and numeracy skills were observed,  regardless of group. Collectively the findings demonstrate that in children with IDD  who present with homogenous behavioural attention difficulties, at the cognitive  level, subtle profiles of attentional problems can be delineated.",

Of 3752 records  in 1982-83, 0.8 percent demonstrated beta activity of 30 hz or faster, with a  disproportionate representation of psychiatric symptoms and mental retardation in  comparison with the general EEG referral population. No other specific correlations  were evident, but the activity also occurred in neurologically and psychiatrically  normal individuals. Although these findings may imply an association between very  fast beta activity and psychiatric illness or mental subnormality, that association  may be spurious or nonspecific in view of the small and heterogenous population  demonstrating this type of beta activity. Controversy concerning very fast beta  activity, as well as other infrequent or controversial patterns, may be lessened by  application of spectral analysis and statistical techniques which are increasingly  available for clinical EEG studies.",

Earlier work has demonstrated  that people with Williams syndrome appear to be spared in the social-perceptual  component of a theory of mind. In this paper we present evidence that they are not  spared in the social-cognitive component of theory of mind. Three experiments with  young children with Williams syndrome were conducted. In each experiment the  children with Williams syndrome were compared to age-, IQ-, and language-matched  children with Prader-Willi syndrome, and children with non-specific mental  retardation. The experiments used different measures of theory of mind ability,  including false belief (Experiment 1), explanation of action (Experiment 2), and  recognition of emotional expressions (Experiment 3). In none of these experiments  did the children with Williams syndrome evidence superior performance compared to  the control groups. The results from this and other studies on Williams syndrome  support the view that the social-cognitive and social-perceptual components of a  theory of mind are dissociable. In Williams syndrome only the latter components,  which are linked to distinct neurobiological substrates, are spared.",

        "Abstract": "Through an international multi-center collaboration, 13 individuals from nine  unrelated families and affected by likely pathogenic biallelic variants in  TBC1-domain-containing kinase (TBCK) were identified through whole-exome sequencing.  All affected individuals were found to share a core phenotype of intellectual  disability and hypotonia, and many had seizures and showed brain atrophy and  white-matter changes on neuroimaging. Minor non-specific facial dysmorphism was also  noted in some individuals, including multiple older children who developed coarse  features similar to those of storage disorders. TBCK has been shown to regulate the  mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway, which is also stimulated by  exogenous leucine supplementation. TBCK was absent in cells from affected  individuals, and decreased phosphorylation of phospho-ribosomal protein S6 was also  observed, a finding suggestive of downregulation of mTOR signaling. Lastly, we  demonstrated that activation of the mTOR pathway in response to L-leucine  supplementation was retained, suggesting a possible avenue for directed therapies  for this condition.",

        "Abstract": "High-throughput sequencing (HTS) of human genome coding regions allows the  simultaneous screen of a large number of genes, significantly improving the  diagnosis of non-syndromic intellectual disabilities (ID). HTS studies permit the  redefinition of the phenotypical spectrum of known disease-causing genes, escaping  the clinical inclusion bias of gene-by-gene Sanger sequencing. We studied a cohort  of 903 patients with ID not reminiscent of a well-known syndrome, using an  ID-targeted HTS of several hundred genes and found de novo heterozygous variants in  TCF4 (transcription factor 4) in eight novel patients. Piecing together the patients  from this study and those from previous large-scale unbiased HTS studies, we  estimated the rate of individuals with ID carrying a disease-causing TCF4 mutation  to 0.7%. So far, TCF4 molecular abnormalities were known to cause a syndromic form  of ID, Pitt-Hopkins syndrome (PTHS), which combines severe ID, developmental delay,  absence of speech, behavioral and ventilation disorders, and a distinctive facial  gestalt. Therefore, we reevaluated ten patients carrying a pathogenic or likely  pathogenic variant in TCF4 (eight patients included in this study and two from our  previous ID-HTS study) for PTHS criteria defined by Whalen and Marangi. A  posteriori, five patients had a score highly evocative of PTHS, three were possibly  consistent with this diagnosis, and two had a score below the defined PTHS  threshold. In conclusion, these results highlight TCF4 as a frequent cause of  moderate to profound ID and broaden the clinical spectrum associated to TCF4  mutations to nonspecific ID.",

Early therapy can restore a narcissistically positive image of the child  and free the family dynamics previously paralyzed around the handicap.

        "Abstract": "The usefulness of the clinical score based on Turner 5-trait scale prior to  undertaking cytogenetic or molecular tests for the diagnosis of the fragile X(A)  syndrome was evaluated. Mean clinical score in fragile X positive patients was  significantly higher than in fragile X negative patients (7.06 +/- 1.85 vs 2.98 +/-  1.6, P < 0.0001). Of 1206 children with mental retardation 360 (29.8%) boys  fulfilled defined clinical criteria to be screened for fragile X syndrome by  chromosomal studies. Twenty three (6.38%) of them were found to be positive for  fragile X syndrome using cytogenetic techniques. Molecular confirmation in 21  affected boys (two were lost to follow up) showed full mutation in 19 (5.27%). Two  patients showed a normal 5.2 kb band on southern blot. This frequency (5.27%) of  fragile X(A) patients among children with non-specific mental retardation is  comparable to the results of studies in the West. Routine use of the clinical score,  and the selection of patients with a score > or = 5 for diagnostic tests would  reduce the laboratory load, especially in countries with limited facilities.",

Clinically, these  deletions are considered to be part of a unique microdeletion syndrome associated  with intellectual disability and speech impairment, typical dysmorphic features,  structural anomalies of the brain, microcephaly, and non-specific multiple organ  anomalies. The critical region for the interstitial 6q microdeletion phenotype was  mapped to 6q24-6q25, particularly the 6q25.3 region containing the genes ARID1B and  ZDHHC14. It has been hypothesized that haploinsufficiency of these genes impairs  normal development of the brain and is responsible for the phenotype. This case  report describes a girl presenting with typical features of 6q microdeletion  syndrome, including global developmental delay, speech impairment, distinct  dysmorphic features, dysgenesis of the corpus callosum, common limb anomalies, and  hearing loss. Chromosome analysis by array-CGH revealed a small interstitial 6q  deletion spanning approximately 1.1 Mb of DNA and containing only one coding gene,  ARID1B. We suggest that ARID1B is the key gene behind 6q microdeletion syndrome, and  we discuss its possible role in the phenotypic manifestations.",

        "Abstract": "PURPOSE: A complete set of subtelomeric fluorescent DNA probes, except the  acrocentric p-arms, was developed in 1996, was optimized in 1998, and is  commercially available. These and other fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)  probes have been used to detect anomalies of the subtelomere regions among groups of  patients with idiopathic mental retardation (MR), developmental delay (DD), and/or  nonspecific dysmorphic features (NDF), and individuals with multiple miscarriages  (MM) who were karyotypically normal by standard G-banding techniques. METHODS: A  total of 425 patients were analyzed, of whom 372 had idiopathic MR/DD/NDF and 53  were involved in MM. An effort was made to select individuals for this study who  were either normal karyotypically or who had subtle chromosomal anomalies that were  inconclusive by banded chromosome analysis, although this was not always possible.  RESULTS: Anomalies involving the subtelomere regions were detected at a frequency of  6.8% in the MR/DD/NDF group. The cryptic or subtle anomalies are estimated to be  about 3.4%. It was necessary to use M-FISH, chromosome, and locus specific FISH  probes to clarify some of the abnormalities. No abnormalities were detected in the  MM group. Deletion variants were present for 2qter, 7pter, and Xpter/Ypter  subtelomeric regions ranging from <1 to 9.6%. CONCLUSIONS: The subtelomeric FISH  probes are instrumental in the detection of subtelomeric anomalies in a significant  proportion, although no more than 50% are subtle, of patients with idiopathic  MR/DD/NDF. In some cases, however, it was necessary to use other FISH probes to  clarify the nature of these abnormalities. No subtelomeric abnormalities were  detected in our group of 53 MM patients, suggesting a relatively low frequency of  occurrence in this patient population.",

        "Title": "Null mutation in PGAP1 impairing Gpi-anchor maturation in patients with intellectual  disability and encephalopathy.",
        "Abstract": "Many eukaryotic cell-surface proteins are anchored to the membrane via  glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI). There are at least 26 genes involved in  biosynthesis and remodeling of GPI anchors. Hypomorphic coding mutations in seven of  these genes have been reported to cause decreased expression of GPI anchored  proteins (GPI-APs) on the cell surface and to cause autosomal-recessive forms of  intellectual disability (ARID). We performed homozygosity mapping and exome  sequencing in a family with encephalopathy and non-specific ARID and identified a  homozygous 3 bp deletion (p.Leu197del) in the GPI remodeling gene PGAP1. PGAP1 was  not described in association with a human phenotype before. PGAP1 is a deacylase  that removes an acyl-chain from the inositol of GPI anchors in the endoplasmic  reticulum immediately after attachment of GPI to proteins. In silico prediction and  molecular modeling strongly suggested a pathogenic effect of the identified  deletion. The expression levels of GPI-APs on B lymphoblastoid cells derived from an  affected person were normal. However, when those cells were incubated with  phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC), GPI-APs were cleaved and  released from B lymphoblastoid cells from healthy individuals whereas GPI-APs on the  cells from the affected person were totally resistant. Transfection with wild type  PGAP1 cDNA restored the PI-PLC sensitivity. These results indicate that GPI-APs were  expressed with abnormal GPI structure due to a null mutation in the remodeling gene  PGAP1. Our results add PGAP1 to the growing list of GPI abnormalities and indicate  that not only the cell surface expression levels of GPI-APs but also the fine  structure of GPI-anchors is important for the normal neurological development.",

Very few studies have examined  the function served by problem behavior in these groups. Using the Questions About  Behavioral Function scale Matson and Vollmer (User's guide: questions about  behavioral function (QABF). Scientific Publishers Inc., Baton Rouge, LA, 1995) the  current study examined group differences in the function of problem behavior  displayed by children with FXS and SMS, in comparison to a control group of children  with non-specific intellectual and developmental disabilities. Between-group  analyses showed children with SMS were more likely to display problem behavior  related to physical discomfort. Both within- and between-group analyses showed  children with FXS were less likely to display attention-maintained problem behavior.  These findings hold implications for the assessment, treatment and prevention of  problem behavior associated with both FXS and SMS.",

Yet abilities to recognise emotional  expressions are often assessed in tasks that imply comprehension of words for  emotions. We investigated the development of these abilities in children with DS in  a longitudinal study that did not involve lexical knowledge of emotions. METHOD:  Children with DS and nonspecific intellectual disability and typically developing  children matched for developmental age (DA) were assessed once a year over 3 years.  They were asked to recognise the facial expression of an emotion after hearing a  vocalisation. RESULTS: In each annual session, children with DS were not  significantly different from others at recognising emotions. Their abilities to  discriminate basic emotions improved significantly and to a similar extent to those  of other children. CONCLUSION: The findings indicate that children with DS develop  emotion recognition abilities similarly to other children of the same DA.",

The duplicated region contains only one  gene, RPS6KA3, that results in partial duplication. The same duplication was present  in his mother and his maternal uncle. This partial duplication inhibits the RPS6KA3  expression, mimicking the effect of loss-of-function mutations associated with  Coffin-Lowry syndrome (CLS). The phenotype of the patient here presented is not  fully evocative of this syndrome because he does not present some of the facial,  digital and skeletal abnormalities that are considered the main diagnostic features  of CLS.

        "Abstract": "FG syndrome, Lujan syndrome, and Ohdo syndrome, the Maat-Kievit-Brunner type, have  been described as distinct syndromes with overlapping non-specific features and  different missense mutations of the MED12 gene have been reported in all of them. We  report a family including 10 males and 1 female affected with profound non-specific  intellectual disability (ID) which was linked to a 30-cM region extending from  Xp11.21 (ALAS2) to Xq22.3 (COL4A5). Parallel sequencing of all X-chromosome exons  identified a frameshift mutation (c.5898dupC) of MED12. Mutated mRNA was not  affected by non-sense mediated RNA decay and induced an additional abnormal isoform  due to activation of cryptic splice-sites in exon 41. Dysmorphic features common to  most affected males were long narrow face, high forehead, flat malar area, high  nasal bridge, and short philtrum. Language was absent or very limited. Most patients  had a friendly personality. Cognitive impairment, varying from borderline to  profound ID was similarly observed in seven heterozygous females. There was no  correlation between cognitive function and X-chromosome inactivation profiles in  blood cells. The severe degree of ID in male patients, as well as variable cognitive  impairment in heterozygous females suggests that the duplication observed in the  present family may have a more severe effect on MED12 function than missense  mutations. In a cognitively impaired male from this family, who also presented with  tall stature and dysmorphism and did not have the MED12 mutation, a 600-kb  duplication at 17p13.3 including the YWHAE gene, was found in a mosaic state.",

The results of the psycho-diagnostic  examination of 23 fra(X) boys were compared to a control group of 17 males of the  same age with 'non-specific' mental retardation. A number of important quantitative  and qualitative differences were observed between the two groups. In the preschool  age group the majority of fra(X) boys was mildly mentally retarded. In the  school-age group, however, most boys were moderately to severely mentally retarded.  This indication of a decline in intellectual performance with age in the fra(X)  syndrome was confirmed by a longitudinal individual follow-up of seven fra(X) boys  in this age group. In contrast to intellectual performance, appearance of the  attention deficit disorder (or hyperkinesis), with its attendent overactivity and  impulsiveness, decreases with age, and is independent of the intellectual level.  Autistic behaviour was more frequently observed in the youngest fra(X) males, and  was more pronounced in the moderately mentally retarded. In more than 50% of the  boys of preschool age the association of hyperkinesis and autistic features was  found. Language and speech development in the fra(X) syndrome is both symptomatic  and specific. Beside a severe, global speech retardation, there are some distinct  speech characteristics in the young fra(X) males such as rapid speech rhythm, speech  impulsiveness and perseverative speech.",

        "Abstract": "The association of marfanoid habitus (MH) and intellectual disability (ID) has been  reported in the literature, with overlapping presentations and genetic  heterogeneity. A hundred patients (71 males and 29 females) with a MH and ID were  recruited. Custom-designed 244K array-CGH (Agilent\u00ae; Agilent Technologies Inc.,  Santa Clara, CA) and MED12, ZDHHC9, UPF3B, FBN1, TGFBR1 and TGFBR2 sequencing  analyses were performed. Eighty patients could be classified as isolated MH and ID:  12 chromosomal imbalances, 1 FBN1 mutation and 1 possibly pathogenic MED12 mutation  were found (17%). Twenty patients could be classified as ID with other  extra-skeletal features of the Marfan syndrome (MFS) spectrum: 4 pathogenic FBN1  mutations and 4 chromosomal imbalances were found (2 patients with both FBN1  mutation and chromosomal rearrangement) (29%). These results suggest either that  there are more loci with genes yet to be discovered or that MH can also be a  relatively non-specific feature of patients with ID. The search for aortic  complications is mandatory even if MH is associated with ID since FBN1 mutations or  rearrangements were found in some patients. The excess of males is in favour of the  involvement of other X-linked genes. Although it was impossible to make a diagnosis  in 80% of patients, these results will improve genetic counselling in families.",

Four  cases of Down syndrome and 1 HIV case showed microdysgenesia of the cerebral cortex.  As the pathogenetic background of cortical irregularities is presently not known, we  analyzed the neuronal expression of drebrin, an actin-binding protein of neuronal  dendritic spines. This protein is thought to play a role in synaptic formation and  was recently shown to be manifold reduced in brains of fetuses with Down syndrome.  However, immunocytochemistry revealed no differences in drebrin expression pattern  between Down patients and controls. We conclude that cerebral cortical  microdysgenesia is an infrequent non-specific pathology in fetal Down syndrome.",

        "Abstract": "Fourteen children (of Arab ethnic origin) with Sotos syndrome are described. They  were referred to King Khalid University Hospital, Riyadh between July 1992 and June  1997. Their phenotypic characteristics were compared with established diagnostic  criteria. There was a male:female ratio of 1.3:1 and a high rate of consanguinity  (36%) among parents. At birth, 54% were large and about one-third showed increased  height and occipitofrontal head circumference (OFHC). The neonatal histories  revealed respiratory and feeding problems in 21%, followed later by delayed motor  milestones and speech development in 57%. During childhood, weight, height and OFHC  increased further to > 97th centile in 71%, 71% and 93%, respectively. A seizure  disorder affected 43%, and 75% had mental retardation (IQ < 70). A non-specific EEG  abnormality was found in half of those with seizures. Cranial CT/MRI showed  ventricular dilatation in 15% and one patient had corpus callosum dysgenesis.  Abdominal ultrasound revealed hydronephrosis in two patients. Radiological  cephalometric measurements showed relative prognathism in cases of Sotos syndrome  compared with controls (p = 0.003). The study highlights the importance of  considering Sotos syndrome in children who present with psychomotor delay.",

Diagnosing anxiety disorders in such patients can pose  challenges, in particular with regard to obsessive and compulsive disorder (OCD).  METHODS: We present the case of an adolescent diagnosed with intellectual disability  with poor expressive language skills who presented with nonspecific mood and  behavioral symptoms, not improving with routine clinical evaluations and treatment.  A structured assessment was done to decipher the psychopathology. FINDINGS: The  structured evaluation was able to diagnose OCD, and the treatment response was  accentuated, bringing about a significant reduction in patient and caregiver  distress. Psychosocial interventions through nurses played a significant role.  CONCLUSIONS: The case highlights the need for a systematic assessment of patients  with intellectual disability to arrive at reliable diagnoses and to plan appropriate  treatment strategies.",

        "Abstract": "A gene responsible for a non-specific form of X-linked mental retardation (MRX19)  was localised by linkage analysis. Exclusions and regional localisation were made  using 21 highly informative PCR-based markers along the X chromosome. Significant  lod scores at a recombination fraction of zero were detected with the marker loci  DXS207, DXS987 (Zmax = 3.58) and DXS999 (Zmax = 3.28) indicating that this gene is  localised to the proximal portion of Xp22. Recombination between MRX19 and the  flanking loci KAL and DXS989 was observed. The multipoint CEPH background map, with  map distances in cM, is DXS996-1.8-KAL-19.0-DXS207-0.9-[DXS987,DXS443  ]-4.3-DXS999-3.5-DXS365-14.0-DXS989. Two other MRX disorders and two syndromal  mental retardations, Coffin-Lowry syndrome and Partington syndrome, have been mapped  to this region. There is a possibility that the 3 MRX disorders are the same entity.  Most MRX disorders remain clustered around the pericentromeric region.",

METHOD: This prospective study investigated the characteristics  and factors that influence outcome in this group, with particular reference to  therapeutic interventions. Sixty-one individuals were identified from contact with  either (1) specialist health and social services for people with intellectual  disability (ID) or (2) nonspecialist services in the criminal justice or (forensic)  mental health/social service systems. The participants were assessed at baseline and  after a mean of 10 months in order to compare recidivism rates and the impact of  therapeutic interventions. RESULTS: The findings suggest that IDO start offending at  an early age, that they frequently have a history of multiple offences, and that sex  offending and arson are over-represented offence types. Those participants recruited  from nonspecialist ID services had significantly higher IQs and were less likely to  have had contact with community social and health support agencies. Despite the high  rates of psychopathology, there was little evidence for efficacy of therapeutic  interventions, which, where offered, appeared to be of a nonspecific nature. At  second interview, approximately half of the sample had re-offended.",

        "Abstract": "Mutations in the MBOAT7 gene have been described in 43 patients, belonging to 18  families, showing nonspecific clinical features (intellectual disability [ID],  seizures, microcephaly or macrocephaly, and mild to moderate cerebellar atrophy)  that make the clinical diagnosis difficult. Here we report the first Italian  patient, a 22.5-year-old female, one of the oldest reported, born to apparently  consanguineous parents. She shows severe ID, macrocephaly, seizures, aggressive  outbursts, hyperphagia. We also documented progressive atrophy of the cerebellar  vermis, that appeared not before the age of 7. The whole-exome sequencing of the  trio identified a novel homozygous variant c.1057_1058delGCinsCA (p.Ala353His) in  the MBOAT7 gene. The variant is considered to be likely pathogenic, since it is  absent from population database and it lies in a highly conserved amino acid  residue. This disorder has a neurometabolic pathogenesis, implicating a phospholipid  remodeling abnormalities. A brain hydrogen-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-MRS)  examination in our patient disclosed a peculiar neurometabolic profile in the  cerebellar hemispheric region. This new finding could address the clinical suspicion  of MBOAT7-related disorder, among the wide range of genetic conditions associated  with ID and cerebellar atrophy. Moreover, the documented progression of cerebellar  atrophy and the worsening of the disease only after some years open to the  possibility of a therapeutic window after birth.",

Urine samples were analysed by thin-layer chromatography for  free sialic acid. Only 62% of the patients with FSASD had a clearly increased  percentage of vacuolated lymphocytes (greater than normal mean + 2 s.d.). In  thin-layer chromatography all the FSASD patients gave a positive test result. No  false positive or negative results were obtained. Electronmicroscopical examination  of peripheral blood lymphocytes demonstrated only non-specific changes in a few  cells. Examination of peripheral lymphocytes for vacuoles is not a reliable  screening test for FSASD. The screening method of choice is the analysis of free  sialic acid by thin-layer chromatography.",

Results from Experiment 1 suggest no specific EF  deficits in autism relative to MA-matched controls, while results from Experiment 2  are consistent with the hypothesis that EF deficits may emerge as a secondary  deficit in autism.

        "Title": "Humour appreciation and comprehension in children with intellectual disability.",
        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Data on typically developing children show that humour development  starts from an early age. Studies investigating humour in children with intellectual  disability (ID) are few and have generally focused on identifying differences  between this population and other groups of children. This study focuses on children  with ID as a heterogeneous group and seeks to answer the following questions: (1)  what kinds of humour do children with ID appreciate most in a video cartoon? (2) How  does the mode of presentation of jokes influence humour comprehension? METHOD: This  study examines humour appreciation and comprehension in school-aged children (n = 9;  chronological age: 7-11 years) with mild/moderate ID. Specific tools were developed  to explore each aspect. Participants rated short scenes from a video cartoon to show  their appreciation for different kinds of humour. A set of video-recorded jokes,  with different modes of presentation, were used in the comprehension task. RESULTS:  The greatest appreciation was expressed for physical and visual humour. Non-specific  scenes (i.e. scenes with no particularly funny elements) were also rated highly.  Jokes presented with gesture were understood more than jokes told without supports.  These differences in comprehension, arising from supported/unsupported jokes, were  statistically significant within the group studied. CONCLUSIONS: The context of  humour (e.g. being part of a video cartoon) is important in determining what  children with ID find funny. The significant difference in comprehension brought  about by a change in mode of presentation (i.e. supported/unsupported joke telling)  suggests that humour comprehension can be facilitated.",

        "Abstract": "SeSAME/EAST syndrome is a multisystemic disorder in humans, characterised by  seizures, sensorineural deafness, ataxia, developmental delay and electrolyte  imbalance. It is exclusively caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous  variations in the KCNJ10 gene. Here we describe a similar syndrome in two families  belonging to the Malinois dog breed, based on clinical, neurological,  electrodiagnostic and histopathological examination. Genetic analysis detected a  novel pathogenic KCNJ10 c.986T>C (p.(Leu329Pro)) variant that is inherited in an  autosomal recessive way. This variant has an allele frequency of 2.9% in the Belgian  Malinois population, but is not found in closely related dog breeds or in dog breeds  where similar symptoms have been already described. The canine phenotype is  remarkably similar to humans, including ataxia and seizures. In addition, in half of  the dogs clinical and electrophysiological signs of neuromyotonia were observed.  Because there is currently no cure and treatment is nonspecific and unsatisfactory,  this canine translational model could be used for further elucidating the  genotype/phenotype correlation of this monogenic multisystem disorder and as an  excellent intermediate step for drug safety testing and efficacy evaluations before  initiating human studies.",

        "Title": "De novo missense variants in MEIS2 recapitulate the microdeletion phenotype of  cardiac and palate abnormalities, developmental delay, intellectual disability and  dysmorphic features.",
        "Abstract": "Gross deletions involving the MEIS2 gene have been described in a small number of  patients with overlapping phenotypes of atrial or ventricular septal defects, cleft  palate, and variable developmental delays and intellectual disability. Non-specific  dysmorphic features were noted in some patients, including broad forehead with high  anterior hairline, arched eyebrows, thin or tented upper lip, and short philtrum.  Recently, a patient with a de novo single amino acid deletion, c.998_1000delGAA  (p.Arg333del), and a patient with a de novo nonsense variant, (c.611C>G, p.Ser204*),  were reported with a similar, but apparently more severe phenotypes. Clinical whole  exome sequencing (WES) performed at our clinical molecular diagnostic laboratory  identified four additional patients with predicted damaging de novo MEIS2 missense  variants. Our patients' features closely resembled those previously reported in  patients with gross deletions, but also included some less commonly reported  features, such as autism spectrum disorder, hearing loss, and short stature, as well  as features that may be unique to nucleotide-level variants, such as hypotonia,  failure to thrive, gastrointestinal, skeletal, limb, and skin abnormalities. All of  the observed missense variants, Pro302Leu, Gln322Leu, Arg331Lys, and Val335Ala, are  located in the functionally important MEIS2 homeodomain. Pro302Leu is found in the  region between helix 1 and helix 2, while the other three are located in the  DNA-binding helix 3. To our knowledge, these are the first described de novo  missense variants in MEIS2, expanding the known mutation spectrum of the newly  recognized human disorder caused by aberrations in this gene.",

        "Title": "Socio-cognitive understanding: a strength or weakness in Down's syndrome?",
        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Social understanding is often thought to be relatively 'protected' in  children with Down's syndrome (DS) and to underlie the outgoing personality  characteristically attributed to them. This paper draws together findings from our  studies of behaviours during object concept testing, generally considered a  theoretically 'pure' measure of early cognitive ability, and from more recent work  focusing on two key socio-cognitive skills: recognising facial expressions of  emotion and collaborative learning. Age range of children studied was 4 months to 18  years. METHODS: Using standardised hiding tasks, object concept ability was assessed  cross-sectionally and longitudinally in children with DS and in age- or  stage-matched typically developing (TD) children. Stability of cognitive advances  was assessed and similarities/differences in developmental pathways explored. In the  emotion recognition studies, the ability to distinguish six primary emotions was  measured, with performance compared with that of developmentally-matched TD children  and age-matched children with intellectual disabilities of similar severity but  differing aetiology [non-specific intellectual disability (NSID) or fragile X  syndrome (FXS)]. In the collaborative learning study, the impact on sorting skills  of working with a peer on a conceptually related task was measured, with outcomes  compared in DS, NSID and TD child pairings. RESULTS: Evidence of counterproductive,  socially-based strategies being inappropriately applied by children with DS in  learning contexts was found in both the object concept and collaborative learning  studies, along with inefficient use of current cognitive and linguistic abilities.  Emotion recognition weaknesses were also identified, although deficits were relative  rather than absolute and individual variability was marked. CONCLUSIONS: In line  with emerging evidence from other research teams, findings suggest possible  difficulties in some core aspects of interpersonal functioning in DS, with both  qualitative and quantitative differences in how social cognition develops and is  applied in learning contexts. Implications for development and for behavioural  phenotype theory are briefly discussed.",

        "Title": "Creatine transporter defect diagnosed by proton NMR spectroscopy in males with  intellectual disability.",
        "Abstract": "Creatine deficiency syndrome due to mutations in X-linked SLC6A8 gene results in  nonspecific intellectual disability (ID). Diagnosis cannot be established on  clinical grounds and is often based on the assessment of brain creatine levels by  magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Considering high costs of MRS and necessity  of sedation, this technique cannot be used as a first level-screening test.  Likewise, gene test analysis is time consuming and not easily accessible to all  laboratories. In this article feasibility of urine analysis (creatine/creatinine  (Cr/Crn) ratio) performed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) as a first  level-screening test is explored. Before running a systematic selection of cases a  preliminary study for further molecular analysis is shown. NMR urine spectra (n =  1,347) of male patients with an ID without a clinically recognizable syndrome were  measured. On the basis of abnormal Cr/Crn ratio, three patients with the highest  values were selected for molecular analysis. A confirmatory second urine test was  positive in two patients and diagnosis was further confirmed by a decreased brain  creatine level and by SLC6A8 gene analysis. A de novo mutation was identified in  one. Another patient inherited a novel mutation from the mother who also has a mild  ID. A repeat urine test was negative in the third patient and accordingly creatine  level in the brain and SLC6A8 gene analysis both gave a normal result. We conclude  that Cr/Crn ratio measured by NMR for male patients represents a rapid and useful  first level screening test preceding molecular analysis.",

Our goal  was to (a) resolve whether specific emotions present recognition difficulties; (b)  investigate patterns of errors; and (c) explore the relationships among  emotion-recognition ability and cognitive, linguistic, and adaptive behavior levels.  Emotion-recognition ability in the Down syndrome group was significantly poorer than  in the typically developing group overall, particularly for fearful expressions.  Error patterns and relationships between task performance and assessment measures  also differed across groups.

All patients received 5-15 years of dantrolene  administration for their spasticity. The cause of pleural effusion was indistinct,  despite close investigations for etiologies such as infection or tumor. The pleural  fluid consisted of sterile exudate in all patients. One patient had eosinophilia in  his pleural fluid, while peripheral blood eosinophilia was seen in the other two.  The pleural biopsy and autopsy specimens revealed only non-specific inflammatory  findings. After dantrolene therapy was discontinued, pleural effusion almost  disappeared in two patients in the following several months, but the other died of  multi-organ failure from another underlying disease. It is important to take  chemical pleurisy into consideration when dealing with pleural effusion of unknown  etiology. Moreover, respiratory side effect should be examined in patients treated  with chronic dantrolene administration.",

Little is yet known about preferences in  individuals with AS. METHOD: Preferences for water-related items and  non-water-related items were assessed in 27 individuals with AS and two matched  groups of participants, one with Down syndrome (DS) and the other with non-specific  intellectual disabilities (NS), using an adapted Dutch version of the Choice  Assessment Scale (Matson et al., 1999). RESULTS: Individuals with AS showed a higher  preference for water-related items compared to individuals in both comparison  groups, substantiating previous reports which have suggested that individuals with  AS are fascinated with water. CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge about preferences in  individuals with AS, especially with regard to water-related objects and activities,  is important in person-centred planning of daytime activities and training programs  for this group.",

Effects of collaborative learning experience on a core cognitive skill, sorting by  category, were investigated in three child groups: typically developing (TD)  children, children with nonspecific intellectual disabilities (NSID) and children  with Down syndrome (DS). Following collaboration, sorting performance improved  significantly in lower ability partners in TD-TD pairings, with this pattern  reversed in NSID-NSID pairings. Neither partner improved significantly in DS-NSID  pairings, suggesting that the sociability attributed to children with DS did not  necessarily support either their or their partner's learning in this social context.",

        "Abstract": "Disturbances in skeletal status in subjects with genetic disorder may increase their  fracture risk. The aim of the study was longitudinal observation of phalangeal speed  of sound changes across the bone over a period of 2 y in 24 patients (14 boys and 10  girls, mean age 9.63 +/- 1.8 y.) and 24 age-matched healthy controls (14 boys and 10  girls, mean age 9.65 +/- 1.71 y.). Weight and height did not differ between patients  and controls at baseline and follow-up. Patients with the following disorders were  evaluated: 7 with Down syndrome, 6 nonspecific mental retardations of unknown  etiology, 5 Martin-Bell syndrome and 6 with other diseases. In patients and  controls, no factors potentially influencing bone metabolism (except for genetic  disorder) were present. Bone status was assessed by quantitative ultrasound at hand  phalanges using DBM Sonic 1200 (IGEA, Carpi, Italy), which measures  amplitude-dependent speed of sound (Ad-SoS [m/s]). At baseline, Ad-SoS and Z-score  were significantly lower in patients than in controls (1892 +/- 51 m/s versus 1936  +/- 43 m/s, p < 0.01 and -1.47 +/- 1.43 versus -0.14 +/- 1.04, p < 0.001,  respectively. In follow-up, Ad-SoS and Z-score increased significantly in patients  (1892 +/- 51 m/s to 1934 +/- 48 m/s, p < 0.0001 and -1.47 +/- 1.43 to -0.76 +/-  1.00, p < 0.01, respectively) and in controls (1936 +/- 43 m/s to 1976 +/- 60 m/s  and -0.14 +/- 1.04 to 0.31 +/- 1.08, p < 0.05, respectively). Follow-up Ad-SoS and  Z-Score were significantly lower in patients (p < 0.01). Longitudinal changes in  Ad-SoS, Z-score weight did not differ between patients and control, and height  increased more in controls (13.2 +/- 2.8 cm versus 11.4 +/- 5.9 cm, p < 0.05)+). In  patients, Ad-SoS increased by 42 m/s (2.22%), and in controls increased by 40 m/s  (2.07%). Difference in Ad-SoS between patients and controls was 44 m/s at baseline  and 42 m/s at follow-up. Using the value of the least significant change (LSC = 20.5  m/s), in 16 patients (67%) and in 18 controls (75%) Ad-SoS showed an increase  greater than the LSC, in one control (4%) a decrease greater than the LSC and in  rest of subjects studied remained unchanged (33% patients and 19% controls) over a  period of observation. In conclusion, despite comparable improvement in measured  ultrasound parameter in patients and controls observed over a study duration, the  difference between them remained stable.",

        "Title": "Healthcare costs of intellectual disability in the Netherlands: a cost-of-illness  perspective.",
        "Abstract": "Healthcare costs are continuously increasing, and impose a strong responsibility on  governments for an adequate allocation of resources among healthcare provisions and  patients. The aims of the present study were to describe the healthcare costs of  intellectual disability (ID) and other mental disorders in the context of the total  costs of all other diseases, and to determinate the future need of healthcare  resources, especially for ID and mental disorders. The present authors performed a  top-down cost-of-illness study comprising all healthcare costs of the Netherlands in  1994. Data on healthcare use were obtained for all 22 healthcare sectors, and used  to ascribe costs to disease groups, age and sex. Costs of mental disorders are by  far the largest in the Dutch healthcare system. Some 25.8% of total disease-specific  costs could be ascribed to mental disorders: psychiatric conditions, 10.6%; ID,  9.0%; and dementia, 6.2%. There are large differences between age and sex groups.  The costs of ID and schizophrenia are higher among men, and the costs of dementia  and depression are higher among women. The age pattern shows two peaks: the first  occurs at 25-35 years of age (ID and psychiatric conditions); and the second at  75-85 years of age (dementia). Time trends between 1988 and 1994 show an average  annual growth rate of 5.2% for total healthcare costs: psychiatric conditions, 4.8%;  ID, 5.4%; and dementia, 9.4%. Demographic projections suggest a less-than-average  cost increase for ID and psychiatric disorders (with annual growth rates of 0.2% and  0.4%, respectively) compared to the costs of dementia and total healthcare (with  annual growth rates of 1.6% and 0.9%, respectively). Intellectual disability and  mental disorders represent a large part of healthcare use in the Netherlands. The  costs will inevitably increase because of the ageing of the population and  increasing life expectancy among people with disabilities. Non-specific cost  containment measures may endanger the quality of care for vulnerable people at  younger and older ages.",

The clinical phenotype associated with the  reciprocal duplication however is not well defined, though speech delay is often  mentioned. We present 14 new 7q11.23 patients with the reciprocal duplication of the  Williams-Beuren syndrome critical region, nine familial and five de novo. These were  identified by either array-based MLPA or by array-CGH/oligonucleotide analysis in a  series of patients with idiopathic mental retardation with an estimated population  frequency of 1:13,000-1:20,000. Variable speech delay is a constant finding in our  patient group, confirming previous reports. Cognitive abilities range from normal to  moderate mental retardation. The association with autism is present in five patients  and in one father who also carries the duplication. There is an increased incidence  of hypotonia and congenital anomalies: heart defects (PDA), diaphragmatic hernia,  cryptorchidism and non-specific brain abnormalities on MRI. Specific dysmorphic  features were noted in our patients, including a short philtrum, thin lips and  straight eyebrows. Our patient collection demonstrates that the 7q11.23  microduplication not only causes language delay, but is also associated with  congenital anomalies and a recognizable face.",

The  maximum lod score was 1.60 (theta = 0.10) with the F9 locus. The localisation of  this MRX gene has now been established by linkage to microsatellite markers. Peak  pairwise lod scores of 4.02 and 4.01 (theta = 0.00) were attained at the DXS1114 and  DXS994 loci respectively. This MRX gene is now designated MRX27 and is localised to  Xq24-26 by recombination events detected by DXS424 and DXS102. This regional  localisation spans 26.2 cM on the genetic background map and defines another  distinct MRX interval by linkage to a specific region of the X chromosome.",

        "Abstract": "RBM10, is an RNA binding protein that is important for development by regulating the  expression of multiple genes. RBM10 is on the X chromosome, and nonsense and  frameshift RBM10 variants cause TARP syndrome in males. In a 4-year-old male, we  identified a novel maternally inherited missense RBM10 variant in the RRM2 RNA  binding domain, c.965C>T, p.Pro322Leu. His clinical features included intellectual  disability, developmental delay, growth restriction, hypotonia, and craniofacial  malformations. These features were much milder than those described in previously  reported cases of TARP syndrome. By in vitro assays, we found that the mutant  p.Pro322Leu RBM10 protein retained its specific RNA binding capacity, while gaining  a low-affinity nonspecific RNA binding. It was normally localized to the nucleus,  but its expression level was significantly reduced with a significantly short  half-life. These results indicated that the p.Pro322Leu missense variant causes a  developmental disorder in humans through a unique loss-of-function mechanism.",

        "Abstract": "The severe mental retardation and speech deficits associated with 22q13 terminal  deletions have been attributed in large part to haploinsufficiency of SHANK3, which  maps to all 22q13 terminal deletions, although more proximal genes are assumed to  have minor effects. We report two children with interstitial deletions of 22q13 and  two copies of SHANK3, but clinical features similar to the terminal 22q13 deletion  syndrome, including mental retardation and severe speech delay. Both these  interstitial deletions are completely contained within the largest terminal  deletion, but do not overlap with the nine smallest terminal deletions. These  interstitial deletions indicate that haploinsufficiency for 22q13 genes other than  SHANK3 can have major effects on cognitive and language development. However, the  relatively mild speech problems and normal cognitive abilities of a parent who  transmitted her identical interstitial deletion to her more severely affected son  suggests that the phenotype associated with this region may be more variable than  terminal deletions and therefore contribute to the relative lack of correlation  between clinical severity and size of terminal deletions. The phenotypic similarity  between the interstitial deletions and non-overlapping small terminal 22q13  deletions emphasizes the general nonspecificity of the clinical picture of the 22q13  deletion syndrome and the importance of molecular analysis for diagnosis.",

        "Abstract": "The impact of metabolic diseases (inborn errors of metabolism) and endocrine  disorders in pediatrics has markedly increased during the last few decades. Critical  periods in the development of the central nervous system need special attention in  children with these disorders. Early diagnosis and treatment are important in order  to prevent mental retardation and serious handicaps in some of these patients.  Certain patients with metabolic and endocrine disorders lack early clinical symptoms  or have so non-specific signs that permanent neurological handicaps are present when  the patients are finally diagnosed. One way to identify these patients is by means  of mass screening. A blood sample is then collected from every newborn infant and  analyzed for abnormal levels of metabolites or hormones. It is possible to detect at  least thirty different disorders in this way. In most European countries screening  programmes involve phenylketonuria (PKU) and congenital hypothyroidism. The  prognosis for these patients has improved dramatically after the introduction of  screening. The Swedish neonatal metabolic screening programme was started in 1965 by  screening for PKU. Subsequently, screening for galactosemia and congenital  hypothyroidism was added. The result of the screening programme 1965-1985 is as  follows: (table; see text) The main benefit of early detection and treatment of  children with PKU, congenital hypothyroidism and galactosemia is the prevention of  mental retardation and other handicaps. Recently nationwide pilot screening for  congenital adrenal hyperplasia (adrenogenital syndrome) was started.",

        "Abstract": "The gene encoding the AT-rich interaction domain-containing protein 1B (ARID1B) has  recently been shown to be one of the most frequently mutated genes in patients with  intellectual disability (ID). The phenotypic spectrums associated with variants in  this gene vary widely ranging for mild to severe non-specific ID to Coffin-Siris  syndrome. In this study, we evaluated three children from a consanguineous Emirati  family affected with ID and dysmorphic features. Genomic DNA from all affected  siblings was analyzed using CGH array and whole-exome sequencing (WES). Based on a  recessive mode of inheritance, homozygous or compound heterozygous variants shared  among all three affected children could not be identified. However, further analysis  revealed a heterozygous variant (c.4318C>T; p.Q1440*) in the three affected children  in an autosomal dominant ID causing gene, ARID1B. This variant was absent in  peripheral blood samples obtained from both parents and unaffected siblings.  Therefore, we propose that the most likely explanation for this situation is that  one of the parents is a gonadal mosaic for the variant. To the best of our  knowledge, this is the first report of a gonadal mosaicism inheritance of an ARID1B  variant leading to familial ID recurrence.",

Subjects were examined with  Wechsler tests (WPPSI, WISC-R or WAIS, according to their capabilities), Progressive  Matrices, Bender or Santucci and memory tests. Physical findings in 5 families were  characterised by micro-orchidism (MiO), microcephaly (MiC), short stature (SS) and  non-specific facial features (XMR +/- MiO +/- MiC +/- SS). The 11 males with MR had  a very low IQ, ranging from 13 to 37 (mean 21.2 +/- 8.8); this did not constitute a  profile definition. Among the females of their families, 4 had subnormal or  borderline IQ, respectively 74, 66, 38 and 37. A second group (2 families) had MiO  but with normal stature and occipito-frontal circumference (XMR +/- MiO). The 7  males with MR had an IQ ranging from 24 to 43 (mean 35.1 +/- 5.8) and showed  frequently better results in performance than in verbal subtests. In these 2  families, 5 females had subnormal or borderline IQ, respectively 77, 72, 71, 70 and  20. In the 5 families of the third group, XMR +/- MaO (fraX-), several affected  males had macro-orchidism (MaO) and facial changes similar to those of fragile X  syndrome. IQ variability, also in the same family (e.g.: the 3 brothers of family 3  had, respectively, an IQ of 26, 28 and 68; and 2 brothers of family 1 had an IQ of  13 and 63) and different profiles. Two females were severely affected (IQ 16 and  24), while another 4 had an IQ, respectively, of 63, 69, 71 and 72.",

        "Abstract": "Patients with a submicroscopic deletion at 1q43q44 present with intellectual  disability (ID), microcephaly, craniofacial anomalies, seizures, limb anomalies, and  corpus callosum abnormalities. However, the precise relationship between most of  deleted genes and the clinical features in these patients still remains unclear. We  studied 11 unrelated patients with 1q44 microdeletion. We showed that the deletions  occurred de novo in all patients for whom both parents' DNA was available (10/11).  All patients presented with moderate to severe ID, seizures and non-specific  craniofacial anomalies. By oligoarray-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH)  covering the 1q44 region at a high resolution, we obtained a critical deleted region  containing two coding genes-HNRNPU and FAM36A-and one non-coding gene-NCRNA00201.  All three genes were expressed in different normal human tissues, including in human  brain, with highest expression levels in the cerebellum. Mutational screening of the  HNRNPU and FAM36A genes in 191 patients with unexplained isolated ID did not reveal  any deleterious mutations while the NCRNA00201 non-coding gene was not analyzed.  Nine of the 11 patients did not present with microcephaly or corpus callosum  abnormalities and carried a small deletion containing HNRNPU, FAM36A, and NCRNA00201  but not AKT3 and ZNF238, two centromeric genes. These results suggest that HNRNPU,  FAM36A, and NCRNA00201 are not major genes for microcephaly and corpus callosum  abnormalities but are good candidates for ID and seizures.",

This genetic heterogeneity implies that pathogenic variants  in a specific gene are found only in a small number of patients, and difficulties  arise in the definition of prevailing genotype and characteristic phenotype  associated with that gene. One of such very rare disorders is autosomal recessive ID  type 66 (OMIM #618221) caused by defects in C12orf4. Up to now, six families have  been reported with mostly truncating variants. The spectrum of the clinical  phenotype was not emphasized in previous reports, and detailed phenotype was not  always available from previous patients, especially from large cohort studies.  METHODS: Exome sequencing was performed in a consanguineous Armenian family with two  affected adult brothers. RESULTS: The patients carry a novel homozygous nonsense  C12orf4 variant. The integration of previous data and phenotyping of the brothers  indicate that the clinical picture of C12orf4 defects involves hypotonia in infancy,  rather severe ID, speech impairment, and behavioral problems such as aggressiveness,  unstable mood, and autistic features. Several other symptoms are more variable and  less consistent. CONCLUSION: This rather nonsyndromic and nonspecific clinical  picture implies that additional patients with C12orf4 defects will likely continue  to be identified using the \"genotype-first\" approach, rather than based on clinical  assessment. The phenotype needs further delineation in future reports.",

The increased methionine was not associated with deficiency of  methionine adenosyltransferase, which was normal or increased in liver, muscle,  erythrocytes, and cultured fibroblasts. Methionyl-tRNA synthetase in fibroblasts was  normal. The hypermethioninemia and a concurrently increased blood  S-adenosylmethionine declined on a diet low in methionine. There was a diffuse,  symmetrical, moderate proximal muscle weakness, but muscle atrophy was not  discernible, and the deep tendon reflexes were hypoactive but obtainable.  Electromyographic abnormalities were not detected. Electron microscopy of muscle  revealed 3 to 6 small myelin figures in the region of the I band in nearly every  fiber, with occasional myelin figures at other sites also. These myelin figures were  more numerous and smaller than those seen accompanying nonspecific myopathies and  may reflect a more specific pathological change. Electron microscopy of liver  revealed three nonspecific lesions in all hepatocytes: (1) numerous megamitochondria  with crystalloid deposit in the matrix; (2) increased numbers of small vesicles of  smooth endoplasmic reticulum; and (3) loss of plasma membrane microvilli, with  extensive bleb formation and shedding of cytoplasm into Disse's space.",

METHOD: Sleep was investigated in 30 individuals with CDC using a sleep  questionnaire. Sleep problems and sleep behaviours in individuals with CDC were  compared with individuals with non-specific intellectual disabilities (NS) (n = 30)  and Down's syndrome (DS) (n = 30). RESULTS: Nine individuals with CDC (i.e. 30%) had  a sleep problem, compared with seven individuals with NS (i.e. 23%) and three  individuals with DS (i.e. 10%). Though there were few differences between diagnostic  groups, night waking problems were most common in CDC. Individuals with CDC  frequently showed behaviours related to disordered breathing and poor-quality sleep.  Several behaviours related to sleep had a higher occurrence in CDC than in DS (P <  0.05) but not in NS. CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded that individuals with CDC do not  have an increased probability of sleep problems as compared with other individuals  who share similar demographic characteristics. Hypotheses about causes of night  waking problems in CDC are generated and suggestions for future research of sleep in  individuals with CDC are given.",

        "Abstract": "In a nation-wide survey of Aicardi syndrome, defined as the onset of epilepsy in the  first six months of life, agenesis of the corpus callosum (partial or total) and  lacunar chorioretinopathy, 18 patients, all girls, born between 1975 and 2002 were  identified in Sweden. Fifteen were definite cases and three were regarded as  probable, since they only fulfilled two of three inclusion criteria in addition to  other cerebral malformations and/or chorioretinal changes. Calculations based on  this survey and population-based studies on epilepsy in retarded children yielded a  prevalence rate in the range of 2 - 15 : 100 000 girls. All but one had an ordinary  birth weight, length and head circumference for gestational age. One was born  preterm, one post term. The age at diagnosis varied from three days to 12 years and  decreased during the period reflecting the increased awareness of the syndrome.  Eleven came to medical attention because of seizures. Six had myoclonic, four  generalized tonic-clonic and eight tonic, clonic or complex partial seizures. One  had hypsarrhythmia, five multifocal epileptiform activity, three bilateral  independent bursts, two burst-suppression pattern, six other types of spikes and one  slowing of background activity. Asymmetrical EEG abnormalities indicating  independent hemispheric dysfunction were detected in 13/18 (72 %). Complete absence  of the corpus callosum was found in 13/18 (72 %), although not identical with the  previous group, a partial defect in 3/18 (17 %), and a thinning in 2/18 (11 %). Of  15 children with definite Aicardi syndrome, 13 had binocular and two monocular  lacunae. In one of the latter two, subtle monocular lacunae were found on fundus  photographs, but had been missed on repeated clinical examinations. Of three  children with probable Aicardi syndrome typical lacunae were reported in one and  other kinds of depigmentation in the other two. Most of the children had anomalous  optic discs. Neuroimaging in infancy or early childhood combined with  ophthalmological examination and ocular fundus photography will facilitate an early  diagnosis of Aicardi syndrome. Seizure type and EEG abnormalities may be  non-specific at onset.",

It is fully penetrant in males and the females can have varied  manifestations because of skewed X-inactivation. The size of the duplication can  range from 0.2\u2009Mb to over 100\u2009Mb. Around 150 cases have been reported in the  literature so far. Here, we report the unusual findings in three cases such as  hepatomegaly, ataxia and females with mild intellectual disability that further  expand the phenotypic spectrum of this disorder.

Additional  three patients with MED13L haploinsufficiency syndrome were identified here in  association with rare complications. One patient had a de novo deletion (c.257delT)  and T2-weighted high intensity in the occipital white matter on magnetic resonance  imaging. Two siblings exhibited an intragenic deletion involving exons 3-14, which  led to an in-frame deletion in MED13L. The deletion was inherited from their carrier  mother who possessed low frequency mosaicism. The older sister of the siblings  showed craniosynostosis; this condition has never been reported in patients with  MED13L haploinsufficiency syndrome. Dysmorphic features were observed in these  patients; however, most of the findings were nonspecific. Further information would  be necessary to understand this clinical condition better.",

        "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The Cognitive Activity Theory suggests an association between  participation in cognitive activities during midlife and cognitive functioning in  the short term. We examined the impact of participation in cognitively stimulating  activities conveyed during leisure activities on crystallized and fluid tests'  performance among adults with intellectual disabilities (ID). METHOD: Adults (n =  32; chronological age = 25-55) with non-specific ID and with Down syndrome rated the  frequency of their participation in leisure activities. Pursuits included more  cognitively involving (reading, participating in academic courses) and less  cognitively involving (cooking, dancing) activities. Three judges ranked activities  according to their cognitive load on a 1 (few cognitive components) to 5 (many  cognitive components) points scale. The findings indicate two new scales:  cognitively stimulating activities and recreational stimulating activities. The  crystallized battery included phonemic fluency, synonyms, idioms, and verbal  metaphors. The fluid battery included the Homophone Meaning Generation Test,  Metaphoric Triad Test, Novel Metaphors Test, and Trail Making Test. RESULTS:  Hierarchal regression with chronological and mental age, recreational, and  cognitively stimulating activities indicated that participation in recreational  activities contributed significantly to the explained variance of word fluency.  Participation in cognitive activities contributed significantly to the explained  variance of most of the crystallized and fluid tests. CONCLUSIONS: The findings  support the Cognitive Activity Theory in populations with ID. The findings also  support the Compensation Age Theory: not only endogenous factors (age, etiology, IQ  level), but also exogenous factors such as life style determining the cognitive  functioning of adults with ID. However, frequency and the cognitive load of the  activities influenced their cognitive functioning.",

        "Abstract": "An epidemiological study was carried out on the group of moderately retarded  brothers (IQ, 30-55) identified by Turner and Turner [1974]. Of the original 58 sets  of brothers, 54 sets (now 17 to 32 years old) were traced; another four sets (missed  in the earlier survey) were added. Forty-five of the 58 pairs were diagnosed as  having nonspecific X-linked mental retardation (MR) giving an overall frequency of  5.57 moderately retarded males/10,000 male births. In 12 of the 45 families,  affected males had the fragile(X) and macroorchidism; six had macroorchidism alone,  giving a frequency of 2.8 moderately retarded males with X-linked MR and  macroorchidism +/- the fragile(X) per 10,000 males. Corresponding heterozygote  frequencies are 7.34 and 3.65/10,000 females respectively. A new subgrouping of  nonspecific X-linked mental retardation is described in six families: X-linked MR,  macroorchidism without the fragile(X). Three other X-linked conditions were  identified: in one family, the Coffin-Lowry syndrome, in another, Duchenne muscular  dystrophy, and in two families X-linked MR and muscle atrophy. Half (56%) of the  obligatory carriers of fra(X)-MR in this study were dull to mildly retarded. The  mildly retarded heterozygotes had a significantly higher percentage of fra(X)  expressing lymphocytes as compared to the intellectually normal heterozygotes. When  the three types of nonspecific X-linked MR for which population frequencies were  calculated were considered together, half of the obligatory carriers (46%) were dull  or mildly retarded, thus confirming that this condition is a significant cause of  mild intellectual handicap in females.",

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Williams syndrome (WMS) is a rare genetic disorder with an estimated  prevalence of 1 in 20 000 live births. Among other characteristics, WMS has a  distinctive cognitive profile with spared face processing and language skills that  contrasts with impairment in the cognitive domains of spatial cognition, problem  solving and planning. It remains unclear whether individuals with WMS process faces  using a featural strategy that focuses on features or a configural strategy that  takes into consideration the contour of a face and spatial relations between  features. METHODS: To investigate face processing in WMS, the tasks specifically  probe unfamiliar face matching by using a design that includes manipulations in face  presentation (thatcherised and non-thatcherised), face orientation (upright and  inverted) and face valence (happy and neutral expression) in a match-to-target face  recognition design. The sample consisted of 20 participants with WMS, 10  participants with non-specific developmental delay (IQ-matched) and 10 normal  control participants (chronological age-matched). RESULTS: Similar to normal  controls, WMS performed best when faces were presented upright. The results show  while the WMS group did not perform as well as their typically developing  counterparts, they did significantly better than the IQ-matched developmentally  delayed group. WMS did not show an accuracy advantage for inverted faces commonly  understood as an index for featural face processing, nor did they perform better on  thatcherised inverted face conditions whereby featural processing is forced.  Furthermore, no accuracy advantage was observed for positively valenced (happy)  faces in the WMS group. CONCLUSION: These results are consistent with previous work  showing a configural face processing approach in WMS, a strategy that is also  utilised by normal controls.",

        "Title": "Understanding of facial expressions of emotion by children with intellectual  disabilities of differing aetiology.",
        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Interpreting emotional expressions is a socio-cognitive skill central to  interpersonal interaction. Poor emotion recognition has been reported in autism but  is less well understood in other kinds of intellectual disabilities (ID), with  procedural differences making comparisons across studies and syndromes difficult.  This study aimed to compare directly facial emotion recognition skills in children  with fragile X syndrome (FXS), Down's syndrome (DS) and non-specific intellectual  disability (NSID), contrasting ability and error profiles with those of typically  developing (TD) children of equivalent cognitive and linguistic status. METHODS:  Sixty children participated in the study: 15 FXS, 15 DS, 15 NSID and 15 TD children.  Standardised measures of cognitive, language and socialisation skills were collected  for all children, along with measures of performance on two photo-matching tasks: an  'identity-matching' task (to control for basic face-processing ability) and an  'emotion-matching' task (happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, fear or disgust).  RESULTS: Identity-matching ability did not differ across the four child groups. Only  the DS group performed significantly more poorly on the emotion-matching task and  only in comparison to the TD group, with fear recognition an area of particular  difficulty. CONCLUSION: Findings support previous evidence of emotion recognition  abilities commensurate with overall developmental level in children with FXS or  NSID, but not DS. They also suggest, however, that syndrome-specific difficulties  may be subtle and detectable, at least in smaller-scale studies, only in comparison  with TD matches, and not always across syndromes. Implications for behavioural  phenotype theory, educational interventions and future research are discussed.",

        "Abstract": "Intellectual Deficiency (ID) is a common neuropsychiatric disorder whose  etiopathogenesis still insufficiently understood. In the last decade, several  surveys, assessing epidemiologic, clinical and etiologic parameters of ID, have been  performed but none of them is realized in a Tunisian population. In this  retrospective survey, we propose to study these parameters, in a Tunisian cohort of  458 patients with constitutional ID, and to assess our diagnostic strategy. Data  analyses, by the SPSS program, reveal a male predominance, a high level of  consanguinity, an advanced mean age of patients, a rare frequentation of specialized  institutions by the severely affected patients, and a high frequency of familial  forms with predominance of the recessive autosomal ones. The study of clinical  parameters and investigations' results shows that 72.1% of our patients present a  syndromic ID. For these patients, chromosomal anomalies are rarely described, EEG  anomalies were usually non-specific in patients without clinical evidence of  epilepsy, and brain anomalies are common in patients with severe ID, neurological  symptoms or history of seizures. Aetiology is identified in 13.1% of them whereas it  is still unknown in 100% of patients with non-specific ID. This study allows us to  better characterize, epidemiologically and clinically, the first large Tunisian  cohort of patients with ID and to assess our diagnostic strategy in order to propose  a revised one that will improve the diagnostic lead, the care chain and the  preventive resources of ID.",

The well-known molecular pathomechanism of this condition, also  referred to as FRAXE, is a (CCG)(n) trinucleotide repeat expansion which leads to  silencing of the FMR2 gene. However, deletions within the FMR2 gene may also be  causative of the disorder. Here, we report on two brothers diagnosed with FRAXE in  whom a small deletion in the FMR2 gene was detected by whole genome array  comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). The deletion was also present in their  clinically healthy mother and maternal uncle who was similarly affected, but not in  a healthy older brother of the two patients. Our observation demonstrates that FMR2  gene deletions may contribute to the FRAXE phenotype. Therefore, we suggest that  screening for FMR2 gene deletions using array CGH should be considered in patients  with non-specific XLID and absent trinucleotide expansion.",

        "Abstract": "Though cross-sectional studies have yielded important information regarding the  trajectory of psychopathology in middle childhood and adolescence in Down syndrome,  there has been little exploration of maladaptive behaviour in the earliest years of  development. In this study, we explore the emergence of maladaptive behaviour in  young children with Down syndrome (n=24) and a mental age-matched comparison group  (n=33) of young children with developmental disabilities of mixed etiologies.  Behavioural data (Bayley Scales of Infant Development, Infant Temperament  Questionnaire, Achenbach's Child Behaviour Checklist) were collected for children in  each group at 12 months, 30 months, and 45 months. Findings from this study suggest  that the onset of internalising behaviour difficulties in young children with Down  syndrome may emerge later in early development than in children with developmental  disabilities of mixed/nonspecific etiologies. In addition, temperament at Time I  appeared to be a much stronger predictor of maladaptive behaviour outcomes at Time 3  in the mixed comparison group than in the Down syndrome group. Implications of this  trajectory of the early development of maladaptive behaviour in Down syndrome for  intervention for young children with Down syndrome are discussed.",

        "Abstract": "Ten individuals, residing in a treatment facility specializing in the rehabilitation  of sex offenders with developmental disabilities, participated in an arousal  assessment involving the use of the penile plethysmograph. The arousal assessments  involved measuring change in penile circumference to various categories of stimuli  both appropriate (adult men and women) and inappropriate (e.g., 8- to 9-year-old  boys and girls). This approach extends the existing assessment literature by the use  of repeated measurement and single-subject experimental design. Data from these  assessments were analyzed to determine if clear and informative outcomes were  obtained. Overall, three general patterns of results emerged. Some participants  showed differentiated deviant arousal or higher levels of arousal to specific  inappropriate stimuli (deviant is a term used in the existing sex-offender  literature to describe this type of arousal). Other participants showed  undifferentiated deviant arousal, in which case they showed nonspecific arousal to  inappropriate stimuli. The remaining participants showed no arousal to inappropriate  stimuli but did show arousal to appropriate stimuli. Implications for assessment,  treatment, and future directions are discussed.",

        "Abstract": "Non-specific intellectual disability of autosomal recessive inheritance (NS-ARID)  represents an important fraction of severe cognitive dysfunction disorders. To date,  only 10 genes have been identified, and further 24 linked-ARID loci have been  reported, as well as others with suggestive linkage. To discover novel genes causing  NS-ARID, we undertook genome-wide homozygosity mapping in 64 consanguineous  multiplex families of Syrian descent. A total of 11 families revealed unique,  significantly linked loci at 4q26-4q28 (MRT17), 6q12-q15 (MRT18), 18p11 (MRT19),  16p12-q12 (MRT20), 11p15 (MRT21), 11p13-q14 (MRT23), 6p12 (MRT24), 12q13-q15  (MRT25), 14q11-q12 (MRT26), 15q23-q26 (MRT27), and 6q26-q27 (MRT28), respectively.  Loci ranged between 1.2 and 45.6\u2009Mb in length. One family showed linkage to  chromosome 8q24.3, and we identified a mutation in TRAPPC9. Our study further  highlights the extreme heterogeneity of NS-ARID, and suggests that no major disease  gene is to be expected, at least in this study group. Systematic analysis of large  numbers of affected families, as presented here, will help discovering the genetic  causes of ID.",

During the past few years, researchers and clinicians have significantly  contributed to define the phenotype of the syndrome, including its cognitive and  behavioral aspects. However, it is not well known yet whether the psychological  problems are specific to the syndrome or secondary to the intellectual disability  (ID). The aim of our study was to better define the psychopathological profile of  WBS and whether or not it is related with IQ or anxiety symptoms. Twenty-five  subjects (12 girls, 13 boys) with a diagnosis of WBS were compared to 27 boys with  Fragile X Syndrome and to 24 boys with ID of non-specific etiology using the Child  Behavior Checklist. Anxiety, depression and attention problems were the main  behavioral problems found in WBS with no gender differences. Significant differences  between cohorts were observed in somatic complaints, delinquent behavior, aggressive  behavior, and externalizing problems. Some associations between IQ and anxiety items  were found. The findings are discussed in terms of behavioral phenotypes, genetic  implications and ID.",

        "Abstract": "In recent studies children with Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS) have been  characterized as having a distinct neuropsychological profile with verbal abilities  being superior to visuo-spatial and motor skills. An unusual command of language,  including excessive use of verbal stereotypes, social phrases, and clich\u00e9s has been  noticed. The aim of this study is to establish whether the quality and quantity of  verbal behavior, and the articulation and tonal quality of the voices of children  with WBS differ from other children with nonspecific developmental disabilities. A  group of 25 children with WBS and a control group of 25 children matched for age  (4-10 years), sex (12 girls; 13 boys), and non-verbal reasoning abilities (mean IQ =  79) were investigated. The Heidelberg Language Development Test and a picture story  were administered. The mothers were asked to answer a questionnaire to assess the  articulation and the vocal characteristics of their children. The results show that  children with WB syndrome do not differ in most qualitative and quantitative tasks  with regard to verbal competence. They produce significantly more correct  plural-singular formations than the control children (t = 2.49, P < 0.01) on a  primitive level of grammatical competence. In general, their articulation was  reported to be more exact and clear (t = -2.73, P < 0.006). More mothers of children  with WBS noticed a production of stereotypes, the use of social phrases, and clich\u00e9s  than did mothers of the control children (Chi square = -6.67 P < 0.005). Children  with WBS were less likely to lisp as compared to the control children (Chi square =  2.08, P = 0.074).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Little is known about behavioural flexibility in children and adults  with Angelman syndrome and whether people with this syndrome have more or less  problems in being behaviourally flexible as compared with other people. METHOD:  Behavioural flexibility scores were assessed in 129 individuals with Angelman  syndrome using 11 items from the Behavioural Flexibility Rating Scale-Revised (Green  et al. 2007). Level of behavioural flexibility scores in individuals with Angelman  syndrome (N = 129) was compared with that of people with non-specific intellectual  disability (ID) (N = 90), Down syndrome (N = 398) and Autism spectrum disorder (N =  235). RESULTS: Comparative analyses show that individuals with Angelman syndrome  were more flexible than those with non-specific ID (P < 0.001) and those with Autism  spectrum disorder (P < 0.01). There were no differences in behavioural flexibility  scores between individuals with Angelman syndrome and those with Down syndrome (P =  0.94). CONCLUSION: It is concluded that individuals with Angelman syndrome are  comparatively flexible in their behaviour.",

        "Title": "Creatine Transporter Deficiency: Screening of Males with Neurodevelopmental  Disorders and Neurocognitive Characterization of a Case.",
        "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Creatine transporter deficiency (CTD) is an X-linked, neurometabolic  disorder associated with intellectual disability that is characterized by brain  creatine (Cr) deficiency and caused by mutations in SLC6A8, the Cr transporter 1  protein gene. CTD is identified by elevated urine creatine/creatinine (Cr/Crn) ratio  or reduced Cr peak on brain magnetic resonance spectroscopy; the diagnosis is  confirmed by decreased Cr uptake in cultured fibroblasts, and/or identification of a  mutation in the SLC6A8 gene. Prevalence studies suggest this disorder may be  underdiagnosed. We sought to identify cases from a well-characterized cohort of  children diagnosed with neurodevelopmental disorders. METHOD: Urine screening for  CTD was performed on a cohort of 46 males with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and 9  males with a history of non-ASD developmental delay (DD) classified with  intellectual disability. RESULTS: We identified 1 patient with CTD in the cohort  based on abnormal urine Cr/Crn, and confirmed the diagnosis by the identification of  a novel frameshift mutation in the SLC6A8 gene. This patient presented without ASD  but with intellectual disability, and was characterized by a nonspecific phenotype  of early language delay and DD that persisted into moderate-to-severe intellectual  disability, consistent with previous descriptions of CTD. CONCLUSION: Identification  of patients with CTD is possible by measuring urine Cr and Crn levels and the  current case adds to the growing literature of neurocognitive deficits associated  with the disorder that affect cognition, language and behavior in childhood.",

        "Abstract": "Seventy-six children had computerized tomography scans as part of an investigation  of mental subnormality; most of them are severely retarded and all those over age 5  years attend special schools. Seventy-two per cent of the children had normal scans.  Twenty per cent showed cerebral atrophy and in only 8% was there a specific  abnormality (agenesis of corpus callosum, arachnoid cyst, communicating  hydrocephalus). None of these findings had any positive prognostic implication.  Sedation or general anaesthesia was required for all except one child. Injection  pethidine compound was used for children under age 5 years or less than 30 kg in  weight, and trimeprazine orally was used for older children. The radiation exposure  was high--5.6 rad per scan, which is 100 times greater than that from a  posteroanterior and lateral chest x-ray film. For these reasons computerised  tomography scans cannot be recommended as a routine part of the investigation of  children with non-specific mental subnormality.",

        "Title": "Working memory training in children with neuropsychiatric disorders and mild to  borderline intellectual functioning, the role of coaching; a double-blind randomized  controlled trial.",
        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Working memory training (WMT) has been shown to offer therapeutic  benefits to both patients with Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and  patients with mild to borderline Intellectual Disabilities (MBID; 60\u00a0<\u00a0IQ\u00a0<\u00a085).  However, robust evidence for transfer effects and treatment benefits of WMT over  placebo training are lacking. Owing to the nature of double-blind research designs  in RCTs, children have received non-specific coaching not based on their actual  training performance. Active coaching based on individual training results (such as  in clinical practice) might enhance the efficacy of Cogmed WMT. Furthermore,  clinical experience and the general treatment approach to these vulnerable children  has shown that the intensity and duration of WMT is often too stressful. This study  therefore investigated the efficacy of a less intensive, but more prolonged Cogmed  WMT (including active personalized coaching and feedback) in reducing behavioral  symptoms and improving neurocognitive functioning and academic achievements in  children with MBID and neuropsychiatric disorders. METHODS/DESIGN: A double-blind  RCT with children (age 10.0-13.11) with neuropsychiatric disorders (ADHD and/or  autism spectrum disorder (ASD)) and MBID (IQ: 60\u00a0<\u00a0IQ\u00a0<\u00a085). Two groups (each  n\u00a0=\u00a026) will receive Cogmed WMT (version R/M) at home or at school for 8\u00a0weeks,  4\u00a0days a week, at 30\u00a0min a day. One group will receive active personalized coaching  and feedback based on their actual individual performance during Cogmed training.  The other group will only receive general non-personalized coaching (i.e. no receive  personalized coaching and feedback). Both groups will undergo a neurocognitive  assessment (working memory, executive functioning, academic achievements) before and  after training and complete several questionnaires (behavioral problems, parenting  style) with a 6\u00a0months follow-up. DISCUSSION: This study will add to the literature  since the role of coaching in Cogmed WMT has not been studied before. It will also  provide opportunities to investigate an alternative version of WMT in a large group  of vulnerable children, for whom few evidence-based treatments are available.  Ultimately, this will allow us to advise mental health care professionals and  special education schools about the use of this type of intervention for children  with MBID and neuropsychiatric disorders.

        "Abstract": "We report a 19-year-old woman with minor craniofacial anomalies, mild mental  retardation, and foramina parietalia permagna (FPP) (OMIM 168500). Cytogenetic  analysis showed a de novo interstitial chromosome 22 long arm duplication. FISH with  a panel of chromosome 22q12-q13 bands-specific BAC clones refined the cytogenetic  investigation, and restricted the duplicated segment to the q12 region. Mutation  analysis of FPP genes identified an insertion mutation in the ALX4 gene (344insC) in  the proband and her father with loss of function of the gene. The patient's  phenotype is considered in the light of the results of the cytogenetic, FISH, and  molecular investigations, and her features are compared with those of other patients  with similar duplications. Finally, variable phenotypic findings due to different  22q duplicated chromosomal segments are discussed. Our report indicates that 22q12  interstitial duplications are associated with craniofacial anomalies and mild mental  retardation, while life threatening malformations are usually not present. Although  these phenotypic changes are common and non-specific, molecular study of our patient  established more precise relationships between clinical findings and 22q duplicated  region(s). This approach fosters better counseling of the families of patients with  newly diagnosed, similar duplications.",

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The prevalence of reflux oesophagitis (RO) in the normally intellectual  population is about 2%, while this condition in the intellectually disabled has an  estimated prevalence of 10%. METHODS: We investigated the presence of RO among 1687  intellectually disabled, with an IQ < 50, from 5 different institutes in the  Netherlands. All were scored for possible associated factors and reflux symptoms,  and compared with the overall population (n = 1580) from the same institutes  (controls). Also, the effect of treatment on symptoms was evaluated after at least  one year of therapy. RESULTS: Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) was suspected  clinically in 169 patients based on the following symptoms: vomiting, haematemesis,  anaemia, rumination or behaviour problems. At endoscopy RO was diagnosed in 107 of  1687 patients (6.4%): 17 (15.9%) grade I, 34 (31.8%) gr. II, 42 (39.3%) gr. III and  14 (13.1%) gr. IV RO (Savary-Miller classification). Cerebral palsy, constipation,  anticonvulsant drugs, an IQ < 35, underweight and gastrostomy feeding appeared to be  possible associated factors, while as reflux symptoms persistent vomiting,  haematemesis, iron deficiency anaemia, rumination, and behaviour problems were  found. Concerning therapy, surgery was found to be effective in 38%, H2 receptor  antagonists in 60% and the proton-pump inhibitor omeprazole in 96%. CONCLUSIONS: In  this group of Dutch intellectually disabled patients with IQ < 50 RO was diagnosed  in about 6% (107 of 1687), mostly severe grades of oesophagitis. Several possible  associated factors were significantly present. From non-specific reflux symptoms  persistent vomiting was the most indicative factor. In this population the most  effective treatment of RO was long-term omeprazole therapy.",

        "Abstract": "Kabuki (Niikawa-Kuroki) syndrome is associated with a characteristic facial  appearance, cleft palate, congenital heart defects, and developmental delay.  Structural brain anomalies have only occasionally been described in Kabuki syndrome.  Chiari type I malformation, characterized by caudal herniation of the cerebellar  tonsils through the foramen magnum, has been described only infrequently in  association with defined syndromes and has been reported once in association with  Kabuki syndrome. We report three additional children with Kabuki syndrome who have  Chiari I malformation. Two children presented with chronic headaches and the third  patient presented with gait abnormalities in adolescence. The incidence of Chiari I  malformation may be higher than previously reported in Kabuki syndrome since it may  not be diagnosed until later in childhood, whereas most reports of Kabuki syndrome  are of young children. Further, symptoms of Chiari I anomaly can be somewhat  nonspecific. Thus, we suggest that Chiari type I be considered in patients with  Kabuki syndrome who present with persistent headache, neck pain, or other symptoms  suggestive of Chiari I anomaly.",

        "Abstract": "AIMS: Trisomy of chromosome 21 is associated with Down syndrome (DS) - the commonest  genetic cause of mental retardation. We report two unusual cases with partial  trisomy of chromosome 21 and tetrasomy of chromosome 21 without DS phenotype. We  include a short overview of the genotype-phenotype correlation studies in  discussion. METHODS: Conventional chromosomal analysis, fluorescent in situ  hybridisation (FISH), quantitative fluorescent PCR (QFPCR) and Nimblegen targeted  chromosome 21 array were used for deciphering the genotypes. RESULTS: Conventional  chromosomal analysis revealed one extra copy of derivative chromosome 21 in  peripheral blood lymphocytes of the patients. FISH and QF PCR analyses identified  duplicated loci (D21Z1, D21S1414, D21S1435) spanning from the centromere to band  21q21. Nimblegen targeted chromosome 21 array specified the range of duplication  from the centromere to the band 21q21.3 (19 Mb) in the first case and the range of  duplication and triplication resp from centromere to the bands 21q21.3 (15 Mb) and  21q11.2 (4 Mb) resp. in the second case. Additional material was of maternal origin  in both cases. The different mechanisms led to the formation of the particular  chromosomal imbalances. CONCLUSION: These findings confirm the conclusion of  nonpresence of DS when bands 21q22.2 and 21q22.3 (Down critical region) are not  duplicated. The patients had nonspecific phenotypes although some of their features  such as \"sandal gaps\", joint hyperlaxity, hypotonia and brachycephaly are present in  patients with DS. Our observation can help to narrow the region responsible for DS  and to map the loci accountable for minor features of DS.",

        "Abstract": "A 14-year-old boy with Down syndrome (DS) showed a gradual decline in his daily  activities and feeding capacities, and a marked deterioration triggered by a  streptococcal infection was observed at the age of 15 years. He became bedridden,  accompanied by sleep disturbance, sustained upward gaze, and generalized rigidity.  Magnetic resonance imaging showed unremarkable findings, but antiglutamate receptor  autoantibodies were positive in his cerebrospinal fluid. Treatment with thiamine  infusion and steroid pulse therapy showed little effect, but gross motor dysfunction  and appetite loss were ameliorated by the administration of l-DOPA and serotonin  reuptake inhibitors. Thereafter, autistic behaviors predominated, including loss of  social interaction, oral tendency, water phobia, and aggressiveness. Initiation of  donepezil, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, resulted in the disappearance of these  symptoms and total recovery of the patient to his previous psychosocial levels. We  hypothesize that the acute regression in adolescence represents a process closely  related to the defects of serotonergic and cholinergic systems that are innate to DS  brains and not just a nonspecific comorbidity of depression or limbic encephalitis.",

Carrier females are mentally normal but may show  signs of the X-linked retinitis pigmentosa carrier state and become symptomatic in  their later years. Analysis of polymorphic DNA markers at nine loci on the short arm  of the X chromosome shows that no crossing-over occurs between the disease and Xp11  markers DXS255, TIMP, DXS426, MAOA, and DXS228. The 90% confidence limits show that  the locus is in the Xp21-q21 region. Haplotype analysis is consistent with the  causal gene being located proximal to the Xp21 loci DXS538 and 5'-dystrophin on the  short arm of the X chromosome. The posterior probability of linkage to the RP2  region of the X chromosome short arm (Xp11.4-p11.23) is .727, suggesting the  possibility of a contiguous-gene-deletion syndrome. No cytogenetic abnormality has  been identified.",

        "Abstract": "To investigate the association between pre-walking locomotor strategies and  psychomotor developments in children with mental retardation (MR), 50 children with  non-specific MR were included in this study. There were 29 boys and 21 girls, 96% of  whom had moderate to severe MR. They were followed from 4-53 months to 25-99 months  of age, and their follow-up periods ranged from 10 to 48 months (mean 30 months).  According to the pre-walking locomotor strategies, these children were categorized  into three groups: the crawling group (n = 34) who used crawling or creeping as  their main locomotion pattern before independent walking; the shuffling group (n =  9) who used shuffling prior to independent walking; and the direct-walking group (n  = 7) who did not have any other locomotor strategies except rolling. In almost all  motor developmental milestones, children in the direct-walking group developed  earlier than those in the crawling and shuffling groups. Children in the crawling  group had more advanced developments than those in the shuffling group. The  difference in the mean ratio developmental quotients of the Bayley Mental Scale  among the three groups was not significant. The present study showed that crawling  may not be a necessary prerequisite for early ambulation or better cognitive  function in MR children.",

        "Abstract": "PGAP2 encodes a protein involved in remodeling the glycosylphosphatidylinositol  (GPI) anchor in the Golgi apparatus. After synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum  (ER), GPI anchors are transferred to the proteins and are remodeled while  transported through the Golgi to the cell membrane. Germline mutations in six genes  (PIGA, PIGL, PIGM, PIGV, PIGN, and PIGO) in the ER-located part of the  GPI-anchor-biosynthesis pathway have been reported, and all are associated with  phenotypes extending from malformation and lethality to severe intellectual  disability, epilepsy, minor dysmorphisms, and elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP).  We performed autozygosity mapping and ultra-deep sequencing followed by stringent  filtering and identified two homozygous PGAP2 alterations, p.Tyr99Cys and  p.Arg177Pro, in seven offspring with nonspecific autosomal-recessive intellectual  disability from two consanguineous families. Rescue experiments with the altered  proteins in PGAP2-deficient Chinese hamster ovary cell lines showed less expression  of cell-surface GPI-anchored proteins DAF and CD59 than of the wild-type protein,  substantiating the pathogenicity of the identified alterations. Furthermore, we  observed a full rescue when we used strong promoters before the mutant cDNAs,  suggesting a hypomorphic effect of the mutations. We report on alterations in the  Golgi-located part of the GPI-anchor-biosynthesis pathway and extend the phenotypic  spectrum of the GPI-anchor deficiencies to isolated intellectual disability with  elevated ALP. GPI-anchor deficiencies can be interpreted within the concept of a  disease family, and we propose that the severity of the phenotype is dependent on  the location of the altered protein in the biosynthesis chain.",

For measures of total stress, and of parent and family  problems, the best predictors were the family's number of friends and the child's  degree of impairment on the Vineland socialization domain; the single best predictor  of parental pessimism was the child's degree of maladaptive behaviour. Although the  stress levels of the families of children with Smith-Magenis syndrome are comparable  to the levels shown by the families of children with Prader-Willi and 5p- syndromes,  these levels are much higher than the stress levels reported by families of children  with mixed or non-specific developmental disabilities. Stress levels may be similar  across aetiologies involving high levels of maladaptive behaviour, but the  correlates of family stress--particularly the moderating role of family  friends--seem specific to Smith-Magenis syndrome.",

Different types of sleep  disturbances may indicate underlying causes of sleep problems and these types of  sleep disturbances may vary between different genetic syndromes. We examined and  compared five types of sleep disturbance as well as severity of sleep problems in  individuals with Cri du Chat syndrome (CDC), Down's syndrome (DS), Jacobsen syndrome  (JS), and individuals with non-specific ID (NS). We used Simonds and Parraga's Sleep  Questionnaire (1982) to assess prevalence of types of sleep disturbance and to  explore differences in types of sleep disturbance and severity of sleep problems  between the four diagnostic groups. In each group, mean scores for Snoring were  significantly higher than those for Sleep apnea and Snoring was the most prevalent  type of sleep disturbance in CDC, DS, and JS. The mean score on Complaints related  to sleep was remarkably high in the JS group. There were no differences in severity  of sleep problems between groups. These findings suggest that snoring is an  important underlying cause of sleep problems in individuals with CDS, DS, and JS.",

In order to search for a possible specific clinical and radiological  profile for mutation in the OPHN-1 gene, clinical and 3D brain MRI studies were  performed in the two families with a known mutation in OPHN-1 reported so far: a  19-year-old female with an X;12 balanced translocation encompassing OPHN-1, and four  affected males of family MRX60 sharing a frameshift mutation in OPHN-1. Clinical  data shared by affected individuals were neonatal hypotonia with motor delay but no  obvious ataxia, marked strabismus, early onset complex partial seizures, and  moderate to severe MR. Brain MRIs performed in three individuals exhibited a  specific vermian dysgenesis including an incomplete sulcation of anterior and  posterior vermis with the most prominent defect in lobules VI and VII. In addition,  a non-specific cerebral cortico-subcortical atrophy was also observed. These  clinical and radiological features suggest a distinct clinico-radiological syndrome.  These preliminary data need to be confirmed in other families and will be helpful  for further targeted mutation screening of the OPHN-1 gene in male patients with  similar clinico-radiological features. In addition, OPHN-1 inactivation should be  considered as a relevant model of developmental vermis disorganization, leading to a  better understanding of the possible role of the cerebellum in MR.",

Our study addresses qualitative analysis of  information processing in Raven matrices performance among individuals with  intellectual disability with that of their typically developed (TD) counterparts.  Twenty-three adults with non-specific intellectual disability (NSID), 15 adults with  Down syndrome (DS) and 35 children with TD matched for mental age, participated.  Participants solved the Raven's Colored Progressive Matrices and five items from the  Raven Standard Progressive Matrices while having their eye movements monitored. The  overall percent of correct answers was significantly higher for the TD group  compared to two ID group. Comparison of the eye movement pattern of each group  indicated that the TD group spent more time on the matrices before shifting to the  options, than the two ID groups. The TD group made significantly less switches from  one rejoins to another, than the ID groups. The difference in the scanning pattern  between the TD and the ID groups is interpreted as a reflection of two different  types of strategies, Constructive matching and Response elimination, respectively.  There were no differences in eye scanning between participants with NSID and those  with DS.",

Recently, a wide spectrum of brain MRI abnormalities and clinical manifestations has  been recognized. We describe two male patients with genetically confirmed ATRX  syndrome, both presented with developmental delay and white matter changes without  typical clinical characteristics of ATRX. Whole-exome sequencing revealed the  presence of ATRX mutations: a novel c.6472A>G mutation in Case 1 and a previously  reported c.6532C>T mutation in Case 2. These two cases expanded the genetic and  clinical spectrum of ATRX syndrome, including brain MRI abnormalities. Our results  suggest that male patients with developmental delay and widespread white matter  changes, even without distinctive facial dysmorphism and hematologic abnormalities,  should be suspected as ATRX syndrome. We support the clinical utility of whole-exome  sequencing, particularly in ultra-rare neurological diseases with nonspecific  developmental disabilities and atypical presentation.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Themes were extracted, using a process of content  analysis, to organize individuals' feedback pertaining to previous versions of the  instructional programme. A 'B' case study design was then employed to follow  administration of the modified programme with three students in Madrid, Spain.  Programme impact was examined relative to changes in each student's uses of ENGs  spontaneously and in response to non-specific verbal prompts, along with team  members' responses to a questionnaire designed to evaluate programme efficacy.  RESULTS: Two of the three students demonstrated particularly rapid and spontaneous  uses of their ENGs. Both quantitative and qualitative feedback from teams supported  programme efficacy for all three students. CONCLUSIONS: The approach appears viable  for individuals with AS and has implications for individuals presenting other  diagnoses as well. Additional educational/clinical and research implications are  discussed.",

        "Abstract": "PURPOSE: There is currently no resective (potentially curative) surgical option that  is useful in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Palliative procedures such as  callosotomy (Cx), vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) or deep brain stimulation have been  offered. We compared the outcomes after Cx or VNS in two consecutive prospective  cohorts of patients with generalised epilepsy. METHODS: Twenty-four patients  underwent callosotomy from 2006 to 2007 (Group 1); 20 additional patients were  submitted to VNS from 2008 to 2009 (Group 2). They had generalised epilepsy of the  Lennox-Gastaut or Lennox-like type. They were submitted to a neurological interview  and examination, interictal and ictal video-EEG, high resolution 1.5T MRI, and  cognitive and quality of life evaluations. The two-year post-operative follow-up  results were evaluated for each patient. RESULTS: The final mean stimuli intensity  was 3.0 mA in the Group 2 patients. Seizure-free patients accounted for 10% in Group  1 and none in Group 2. Ten and sixteen percent of the Group 1 and 2 patients,  respectively, were non-responders. Improvements in attention and quality of life  were noted in 85% of both Group 1 and 2 patients. Rupture of the secondary bilateral  synchrony was noted in 85% of Group 1 patients; there was no EEG modification after  VNS in Group 2. Both procedures were effective regarding the control of atypical  absences and generalised tonic-clonic seizures. Both procedures were not effective  in controlling tonic seizures. Callosotomy was very effective in reducing the  frequency of atonic seizures, but VNS was ineffective. In contrast, callosotomy was  not effective in reducing myoclonic seizures, whereas VNS was. DISCUSSION:  Callosotomy might be preferred as the primary treatment in children with  Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, and no specific findings on MRI if atonic seizures prevail  in the patient's clinical picture; when myoclonic seizures prevail, the same might  hold true in favour of VNS. When atypical absence or generalised tonic-clonic  seizures are the main concern, although both procedures carry similar effectiveness,  VNS might be considered a good option as an initial approach, taking into account  the adverse event profile. Patients should be advised that both procedures are not  very effective in the treatment of tonic seizures.",

As part of a positional  cloning effort to identify MR genes, we have generated a YAC-based transcript map.  We first constructed a YAC/STS framework by extending previously published contigs.  This framework map consists of a minimal set of 119 clones, covering approximately  20 Megabases (Mb) and allowing the precise ordering of 71 STSs between DXS136 and  DXS472. This YAC contig was then used to define the positions of genes and expressed  sequence tags (ESTs) assigned to the Xcen-Xq21.3 region. In addition to the genes  previously localized to this part of the X chromosome, 18 transcription units  corresponding to additional known genes or gene family members, one pseudogene and  15 novel transcripts were mapped. This transcriptional map incorporates 51  transcription units and provides a useful resource of candidate genes for some of  the disorders assigned to this region of the X chromosome.",

        "Abstract": "An insertional translocation (IT) can result in pure segmental aneusomy for the  inserted genomic segment allowing to define a more accurate clinical phenotype.  Here, we report on two siblings sharing an unbalanced IT inherited from the mother  with a history of learning difficulty. An 8-year-old girl with developmental delay,  speech disability, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), showed by  GTG banding analysis a subtle interstitial alteration in 21q21. Oligonucleotide  array comparative genomic hybridization (array-CGH) analysis showed a 4q13.1-q13.3  duplication spanning 8.6 Mb. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with  bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones confirmed the rearrangement, a  der(21)ins(21;4)(q21;q13.1q13.3). The duplication described involves 50 RefSeq genes  including the EPHA5 gene that encodes for the EphA5 receptor involved in embryonic  development of the brain and also in synaptic remodeling and plasticity thought to  underlie learning and memory. The same rearrangement was observed in a younger  brother with behavioral problems and also exhibiting ADHD. ADHD is among the most  heritable of neuropsychiatric disorders. There are few reports of patients with  duplications involving the proximal region of 4q and a mild phenotype. To the best  of our knowledge this is the first report of a duplication restricted to band 4q13.  This abnormality could be easily missed in children who have nonspecific cognitive  impairment. The presence of this behavioral disorder in the two siblings reinforces  the hypothesis that the region involved could include genes involved in ADHD.",

        "Abstract": "Fragile X syndrome is common; its prevalence approaches 1 per 5,000. Fragile X  syndrome is the most common inherited cause of mental retardation. Many  professionals must deal with fragile X individuals on a daily basis. However,  despite the diverse information on the epidemiology, clinical features, unique  pattern of inheritance, cytogenetic, and molecular diagnosis and scales for the  diagnosis of this syndrome, the diagnosis of fragile X syndrome is still not always  made by the patients' specialists. Here we present the difficulties in the diagnosis  of fragile X syndrome in 11 children under 8 years of age, 10 boys and one girl. We  report data on initial symptoms, behavioral features, and physical and mental  development before molecular studies were considered. The possible causes for the  diagnosis delay were multiple: nonspecific features (e.g., macrocephaly, overgrowth,  obesity), unremarkable physical examination, family history apparently  noncontributory, and lack of or delayed molecular testing. Careful clinical  examination of young children and DNA screening in case of doubt, and education of  professionals in medical specialty areas, behavioral sciences, education, and other  fields are recommended.",

They appeared to adhere more rigidly than controls to a global deployment of  visual attention. Their visual processing difficulties were not related to the level  of mental ability.

The  significance of finding a +14q- karyotype must, however, be considered in the  knowledge that ESA fragments have been associated with disorders that do not have a  chromosome aberration pathogenesis. A balanced translocation should always be sought  in parents of affected children. Finally, the proximal long arm of chromosome 14  apparently has at least 2 sites of relative fragility: 14q12 in vitro and 14q22 in  vivo. Blood group analyses have been uninformative (2, 5).",

Electrophysiological studies showed signs of myopathy, and muscle biopsies  demonstrated only nonspecific signs. Brain MRIs in two of the sibs showed  leukencephalopathy with delayed myelination, frontal and parietal hyperintensities,  and hippocampal atrophy in one. We have been unable to find a description of this  association of features in literature. Based on the occurrence in siblings, no  significant difference in phenotype between the brothers and sister, absence of  manifestations in parents, and a likely consanguinity between parents we performed a  homozygosity mapping. A single identical-by-descent bloc encompassing 57 genes  located at 3p24.3-p25.3 was found to segregate within the family with this  phenotype. \u00a9 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

To date >90 genes associated with X-linked intellectual disability have been  identified and, among these, IL1RAPL1 (interleukin 1 receptor accessory protein-like  1), was first described and mapped to Xp21.3-22.1 in 1999. Intragenic deletions of  IL1RAPL1, only rarely identified, have mostly been associated with nonspecific  intellectual disability (IDX) and autism spectrum disorder. Array-CGH analysis  performed in our patient with intellectual disability, mild dysmorphic signs and  changes in behavior identified a 285\u2009Kb deletion in chromosome Xp21.3-21.2, with  breakpoints lying in IL1RAPL1 gene intron 2 and intron 3. This is the first patient  reported in literature with deletion of only exon 3 of IL1RAPL1 gene. Our patient  also exhibits bilateral progressive neurosensorial deafness, which has not been  previously associated with IL1RAPL1 mutations.",

        "Title": "Rett syndrome: a retrospective pilot study on potential early predictive  symptomatology.",
        "Abstract": "A pilot study is presented, in which traditional neurodevelopmental parameters were  retrospectively used in an attempt to compare the early development of 10 young  girls with Rett syndrome (RS) to that of considered normality in child health  screening. The early developmental profile at key ages was defined by applying the  Denver Developmental Screening Test frames for the range of normal development, to  the achievements recorded for each child during routine developmental assessment in  Swedish child health care. Key ages chosen were 6, 9-10, 15, 18 and 24 months. At  the 6 month level no predictive deviations could have been revealed. At 9-10 months  suspicions of abnormal development could have been arisen from a delayed,  dissociated motor development combined with immaturity of equilibrium functions.  Developmental deviations and neurological signs indicative of RS had been present in  5 of the girls at 15 months, in 8 at 18 months and in all 10 at 24 months. Possible  predictive signs were loss of acquired hand skill and learned single words,  diminished communication and contact ability, appearance of truncal instability and  dysequilibrium signs. The insidious appearance of motor developmental deviations  during infancy, dwelling inside the concept of normality, was confirmed. Loss of  acquired manipulative hand skill, often mixed with non-specific circulating  hand-mouth movements, still constitutes the single most informative early warning  signal for the syndrome.",

        "Abstract": "We have been carrying out studies aimed at improving prenatal detection of the  fragile X chromosome/mutation. Our current protocol requires a turnaround time (TAT)  of several days. In an attempt to reduce the TAT, we have turned to the use of  monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Monoclonal antibody 1A1 (provided by Dr. Mandel of  INSERM) immunostaining was performed according to a modified three-step  immunocytochemical procedure. We found that cytoplasmic staining intensities, using  mAb 1A1/avidin biotinylated complex/diaminobenzidine, varied from light to heavy  within each sample, with controls exhibiting a majority of heavily stained cells in  both chorionic villus (CV) sample and amniotic fluid cultured cells. Using mAb 1A1  and a new nuclear-specific antibody, mAb 3F11, we found that CV cultured cells  harboring the FMR1 full mutation could be distinguished from controls as early as 10  weeks of gestation in both male and female specimens. Western blot analysis showed  that the antibodies have similar staining patterns but that mAb 3F11 has fewer  background/nonspecific bands. Our results demonstrate that it is feasible to detect  fragile X full mutations within one day after obtaining cells from CV specimens  taken as early as 10 weeks of gestation.",

        "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The prevalence of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) in randomly  selected, institutionalized, intellectually disabled individuals (IQ < 50) in The  Netherlands is high. DESIGN: In this study we investigated the prevalence of GORD  and reflux oesophagitis (RO) in intellectually disabled individuals specifically  selected for symptoms such as: behavioural difficulties such as automutilation, food  refusal, fear and restlessness, vomiting, regurgitation and rumination. Predisposing  factors were also evaluated. METHODS: One hundred and ten individuals from one  institute underwent a 24-h oesophageal pH test and were scored for predisposing  factors and non-specific reflux symptoms. A pathological pH test was defined as a pH  lower than 4 more than 4.5% of the measured time. Subjects with a pathological pH  test (patients) were compared to those with a normal pH test (controls). RESULTS: In  seven cases (6.4%) the test failed for technical reasons. In 57 (55.3%) cases a  pathological pH test was found. RO was diagnosed in 33 (64.7%) patients. The use of  anticonvulsant drugs and cerebral palsy appeared to be predisposing factors, while  the non-specific reflux symptoms did not discriminate for GORD. CONCLUSION: The  prevalence of GORD was equal in a randomly selected group of intellectually disabled  individuals, and in this group, specifically selected on account of possible reflux  symptoms. This study confirms that in this particular group, it is nearly impossible  to discriminate for the diagnosis of GORD on non-specific reflux symptoms only.  However, GORD may be suspected where there are certain predisposing factors,  particularly cerebral palsy and use of anticonvulsant drugs.)",

The mean testicular volume was 19.5 +/- 15.8 ml, comparable  to the normal adult male mean of 17-19 ml. However, the number of institutionalized  males with V greater than or equal to 25 ml and V less than or equal to 10 ml was  increased approximately fourfold over the normal male population. Resident adult  males were grouped into three categories based on their testicular volumes: (1) V  greater than or equal to 25 ml (macro-orchid); (2) V less than or equal to 15 ml  (micro-orchid); and (3) 15 less than V less than 25 ml ('normal'). An equal number  of randomly selected males from each category were cytogenetically screened for the  fra(X) syndrome as well as for non-fra(X) chromosome abnormalities. The overall  frequencies of these disorders were 3.1% and 3.9%, respectively. The fra(X) syndrome  was found in a significantly higher percentage of macro-orchid males (10.3%) as  compared to males with either micro-orchidism (1.2%) or normal testicular volume  (1.2%). There was no significant difference in the distribution of either fra(X)  negative non-specific XLMR or non-fra(X) chromosome abnormalities among resident  males from these three categories. Testicular volumes greater than or equal to 25  ml, especially those exceeding 40 ml, were thus shown to be useful clinical markers  in the diagnosis of the fra(X) syndrome. Reduced testicular volume was not a useful  clinical marker in the evaluation of other non-Down's syndrome chromosome  abnormalities.",

        "Abstract": "Pregnancy and delivery complications as indicated in medical records and maternal  reports for 23 high-functioning autistic females and 23 high-functioning males of  similar IQ and age were compared with those of 54 of their normally developing  siblings. Autistic subjects of both sexes had higher non-optimality scores than  their siblings. Much of this difference was accounted for by a higher incidence of  firstborns and fourth- or later-borns in the autistic group. Of factors found in  previous research with mentally handicapped, autistic samples, only estimated weeks  of gestation greater than 42 occurred more often in autistic subjects than siblings.  The only sex difference specific to the autistic group was that autistic males came  from larger families than females. These data provide slight support for the  contribution of nonspecific pre- and perinatal factors to other etiological bases of  autism. It is proposed that pre- and perinatal factors may play less of a role in  autism in high-functioning individuals than suggested in studies of autism  associated with severe retardation.",

        "Abstract": "CONTEXT: Chromosomal abnormalities that involve the proximal region of chromosome  15q occur relatively frequently in the human population. However, interstitial  triplications involving one 15 homologue are very rare with three cases reported to  date. OBJECTIVE: To provide a detailed molecular characterisation of four additional  patients with interstitial triplications of chromosome 15q11-q14. DESIGN: Molecular  analyses were performed using DNA markers and probes specific for the 15q11-q14  region. SETTING: Molecular cytogenetics laboratory at the University of Chicago.  SUBJECTS: Four patients with mild to severe mental retardation and features of  Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) or Angelman syndrome (AS) were referred for molecular  cytogenetic analysis following identification of a suspected  duplication/triplication of chromosome 15q11-q14 by routine cytogenetic analysis.  MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) was performed to  determine the type of chromosomal abnormality present, the extent of the abnormal  region, and the orientation of the extra chromosomal segments. Molecular  polymorphism analysis was performed to determine the parental origin of the  abnormality. Methylation and northern blot analyses of the SNRPN gene were performed  to determine the effect of extra copies of the SNRPN gene on its methylation pattern  and expression. RESULTS: Fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) using probes  within and flanking the Prader-Willi/Angelman syndrome critical region indicated  that all patients carried an intrachromosomal triplication of proximal 15q11-q14 in  one of the two chromosome 15 homologues (trip(15)). In all patients the orientation  of the triplicated segments was normal-inverted-normal, suggesting that a common  mechanism of rearrangement may have been involved. Microsatellite analysis showed  the parental origin of the trip(15) to be maternal in three cases and paternal in  one case. The paternal triplication patient had features similar to PWS, one  maternal triplication patient had features similar to AS, and the other two maternal  triplication patients had non-specific findings including hypotonia and mental  retardation. Methylation analysis at exon 1 of the SNRPN locus showed increased  dosage of either the paternal or maternal bands in the paternal or maternal  triplication patients, respectively, suggesting that the methylation pattern shows a  dose dependent increase that correlates with the parental origin of the  triplication. In addition, the expression of SNRPN was analysed by northern blotting  and expression levels were consistent with dosage and parental origin of the  triplication. CONCLUSIONS: These four additional cases of trip(15) will provide  additional information towards understanding the phenotypic effects of this  abnormality and aid in understanding the mechanism of formation of other chromosome  15 rearrangements.",

Soon after  delineation, SPG1 was incorporated into the spectrum of MASA syndrome. HSAS and MASA  syndrome show great clinical overlap; DNA linkage analysis places the loci at Xq28.  In an increasing number of families with MASA syndrome or HSAS, mutations in L1CAM,  a gene located at Xq28, have been reported. In order to further delineate the  clinical spectrum, we studied 6 families with male patients presenting with MASA  syndrome, HSAS, or a mixed phenotype. We summarized data from previous reports and  compared them with our data. Clinical variability appears to be great, even within  families. Problems in genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis, the possible  overlap with X-linked corpus callosum agenesis and FG syndrome, and the different  forms of X-linked complicated spastic paraplegia are discussed. Since adducted  thumbs and spastic paraplegia are found in 90% of the patients, the condition may be  present in males with nonspecific mental retardation. We propose to abandon the  designation MASA syndrome and use the term HSAS/MASA spectrum, incorporating SPG1.",

In this report we present a child with this  anomaly, and we compare his clinical manifestations with previously reported  patients. CLINICAL CASE: A 12 year-old boy presented with low birth weight, mental  retardation, microcephaly, short stature, hypotonia, and minor facial anomalies:  hypotelorism, bilateral epicanthic folds, long philtrum, thin lips, narrow palate,  micrognathia and low-set ears. Digital anomalies were bilateral brachyclinodactily  of the fifth finger, and cutaneous syndactyly between second and third fingers. The  boy had a pleasant personality but exhibit attachment for people and things with  unrestricted affect. Cytogenetic analysis on peripheral white blood cells showed a  r(8) chromosome. Parental karyotypes were both normal. CONCLUSIONS: The major  features in the boy studied by us were found also in the other cases reported with  an r(8) chromosome, but all they were non-specific features, and do not support the  existence of a readily recognizable r(8) chromosome syndrome . Follow-up data with  special emphasis on the behavioral characteristics are needed for defining an  specific behavioral phenotype.",

        "Title": "Impairment of different protein domains causes variable clinical presentation within  Pitt-Hopkins syndrome and suggests intragenic molecular syndromology of TCF4.",
        "Abstract": "Pitt-Hopkins syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by severe  intellectual disability and a distinctive facial gestalt. It is caused by  haploinsufficiency of the TCF4 gene. The TCF4 protein has different functional  domains, with the NLS (nuclear localization signal) domain coded by exons 7-8 and  the bHLH (basic Helix-Loop-Helix) domain coded by exon 18. Several alternatively  spliced TCF4 variants have been described, allowing for translation of variable  protein isoforms. Typical PTHS patients have impairment of at least the bHLH domain.  To which extent impairment of the remaining domains contributes to the final  phenotype is not clear. There is recent evidence that certain loss-of-function  variants disrupting TCF4 are associated with mild ID, but not with typical PTHS. We  describe a frameshift-causing partial gene deletion encompassing exons 4-6 of TCF4  in an adult patient with mild ID and nonspecific facial dysmorphisms but without the  typical features of PTHS, and a c.520C\u00a0>\u00a0T nonsense variant within exon 8 in a child  presenting with a severe phenotype largely mimicking PTHS, but lacking the typical  facial dysmorphism. Investigation on mRNA, along with literature review, led us to  suggest a preliminary phenotypic map of loss-of-function variants affecting TCF4. An  intragenic phenotypic map of loss-of-function variants in TCF4 is suggested here for  the first time: variants within exons 1-4 and exons 4-6 give rise to a recurrent  phenotype with mild ID not in the spectrum of Pitt-Hopkins syndrome (biallelic  preservation of both the NLS and bHLH domains); variants within exons 7-8 cause a  severe phenotype resembling PTHS but in absence of the typical facial dysmorphism  (impairment limited to the NLS domain); variants within exons 9-19 cause typical  Pitt-Hopkins syndrome (impairment of at least the bHLH domain). Understanding the  TCF4 molecular syndromology can allow for proper nosology in the current era of  whole genomic investigations.",

To determine the frequency of FRAXE triplet repeat  expansion among persons with developmental disability, 396 individuals from two  institutions were studied, all of whom were negative for FMR1 repeat expansion.  Clinically, there was a wide range of mental impairment, with the majority (61.1%)  being severely to profoundly affected. The distribution of FRAXE GCC-repeat numbers  in the study population was 5-38: 28 (5.6%) with 10-14 repeats; 366 (73.8%) with  15-19 repeats; 74 (14.9%) with 20-24 repeats; 20 (4.0%) with 25-29 repeats; and 5  (1.0%) with 30-38 repeats, with no individuals demonstrating repeat expansion. One  profoundly retarded male was found to have a deletion of about 40 bp. Southern blots  of HindIII-digested DNAs from individuals with > or = 26 repeats all showed normal  patterns.

        "Abstract": "B\u00f6rjeson-Forssman-Lehmann syndrome (BFLS) is a syndromal X-linked mental  retardation, which maps by linkage to the q26 region of the human X chromosome. We  have identified a male patient with BFLS-like features and a duplication,  46,Y,dup(X)(q26q28), inherited from his phenotypically normal mother. Fluorescence  in situ hybridisation using yeast artificial chromosome clones from Xq26 localised  the duplication breakpoint to an approximately 400-kb interval in the Xq26.3 region  between DXS155 and DXS294/DXS730. Database searches and analysis of available  genomic DNA sequence from the region revealed the presence of the fibroblast growth  factor homologous factor gene, FHF2, within the duplication breakpoint interval. The  gene structure of FHF2 was determined and two new exons were identified, including a  new 5' end exon, 1B. FHF2 is a large gene extending over approximately 200 kb in  Xq26.3 and is composed of at least seven exons. It shows tissue-specific alternative  splicing and alternative transcription starts. Northern blot hybridisation showed  highest expression in brain and skeletal muscle. The FHF2 gene localisation and  tissue-specific expression pattern suggest it to be a candidate gene for familial  cases of the BFLS syndrome and other syndromal and non-specific forms of X-linked  mental retardation mapping to the region.",

        "Abstract": "The study aimed to investigate a group of children with severe learning  disabilities, challenging daytime behaviour, and severe sleep problems to see if  successful behavioural treatment of the children's sleep problems resulted in  reduced daytime challenging behaviour as reported by mothers and teachers. A  randomised controlled trial of behavioural interventions for the children's sleep  problems was conducted (N = 30). The intervention group received an individually  tailored behavioural programme and were supported by telephone calls from the  therapist. Baseline assessments of the children's behaviour were made using the  Aberrant Behavior Checklist and were repeated 1 month and 3 months after the start  of intervention. There were no behavioural changes that were specific to children in  the treatment group. However, improvements in some behaviours were seen in both the  intervention and the control group at the 1-month and 3-month assessments and there  was agreement between mothers' and teachers' reports for many of these changes. The  results suggest that nonspecific effects of participating in the study (including an  increased sleep duration, which was seen in both groups), rather than resolution of  sleep problem per se, may have a beneficial effect on child behaviour and these  factors need to be identified for therapeutic use.",

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Deletions and mutations involving the SHANK3 gene lead to a nonspecific  clinical presentation with moderate to profound intellectual disability, severely  delayed or absent speech, and autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Better knowledge of  the clinical spectrum of SHANK3 haploinsufficiency is useful to facilitate clinical  care monitoring and to guide molecular diagnosis, essential for genetic counselling.  CASE PRESENTATION: Here, we report a detailed clinical description of a 10-year-old  girl carrying a pathogenic interstitial 22q13.3 deletion encompassing only the first  17 exons of SHANK3. The clinical features displayed by the girl strongly suggested  the diagnosis of dementia infantilis, described by Heller in 1908, also known as  childhood disintegrative disorder. CONCLUSION: Our present case confirms several  observations according to which regression may be part of the clinical phenotype of  SHANK3 haploinsufficiency. Therefore, we think it is crucial to look for mutations  in the gene SHANK3 in patients diagnosed for childhood disintegrative disorder or  any developmental disorder with a regressive pattern involving social and  communicative skills as well as cognitive and instinctual functions, with onset  around 3 years.",

        "Title": "Haploinsufficiency of SOX5, a member of the SOX (SRY-related HMG-box) family of  transcription factors is a cause of intellectual disability.",
        "Abstract": "Intellectual disability (ID) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous  condition; the cause is unknown in most non-specific and sporadic cases. To  establish an etiological basis in those patients represents a difficult challenge.  Over the last years it has become apparent that chromosomal rearrangements below the  detection level of conventional karyotyping contribute significantly to the cause of  ID. We present three patients with non-specific intellectual disability who all have  overlapping microdeletions in the chromosomal region 12p12.1. De novo occurrence of  the deletion could be proven in the two cases from which parental samples were  available. All three identified deletions have different breakpoints and range in  size from 120 kb to 4.9 Mb. The smallest deletion helps to narrow down the critical  region to a genomic segment (chr12:23,924,800-24,041,698, build 37/hg19)  encompassing only one gene, SOX5. SOX5 is a member of the SOX (SRY-related HMG-box)  family of transcription factors shown to play roles in chondroblast function,  oligodendrocyte differentiation and migration, as well as ensuring proper  development of specific neuronal cell types. Because of these biological functions,  mutations in SOX5 are predicted to cause complex disease syndromes, as it is the  case for other SOX genes, but such mutations have not yet been identified. Our  findings indicate that haploinsufficiency of SOX5 is a cause of intellectual  disability without any striking physical anomalies.",

Ophthalmological investigation was  normal. A marked white matter high signal was seen on magnetic resonance imaging  without cortical dysplasia. Dystrophic changes were seen on muscle biopsy. Two  brothers had had a similar history with early death. Muscular immunocytochemical  studies showed a normal staining for dystrophin and all dystrophin related  glycoproteins (including 43 and 50 DAG). Merosin staining was normal. This case  differs from Fukuyama's congenital dystrophy, from merosin negative congenital  muscular dystrophy, or from other congenital muscular dystrophy with CNS  dysfunction.

        "Abstract": "A total of 368 patients aged 1 year 11 months to 35 years with oligophrenia were  examined cytogenetically. Out of 58 boys with a typical disease picture, the fragile  X chromosome (fra-X) was revealed in 57. In all the cases, the syndrome could be  diagnosed clinically before chromosomal analysis was made. In a group of children  with undifferentiated oligophrenia including those with the sex-linked inheritance  type, fra-X was not discovered. Besides, the fragile X chromosome was revealed in 4  girls. Of these, 3 were probands' sisters and one case was sporadic. The girls  manifested both symptomatology typical for Martin-Bell syndrome and nonspecific  mental retardation. Another 55 probands' relatives were examined clinically and  cytogenetically. The fra-X was discovered in 9 mothers of the patients. The mean IQ  in the women with the revealed fragile X chromosome was much lower than the mean IQ  of all the women, mothers of the sick children. It is concluded that in spite of a  wide range of the variability of somatic and psychopathological disorders in  patients with Martin-Bell syndrome, the possibility of the clinical diagnosis of the  disease without making cytogenetic studies attains as much as almost 100%. Symptoms,  specific for the clinical diagnosis of the disease were distinguished.",

        "Abstract": "Abdominal free air upon X-ray examination implies a medical emergency, but there is  an extensive differential diagnosis that should be considered. Fecaloma is one of  the possible imitators of free abdominal air. Fecaloma is a complication of chronic  constipation, in which a large fecal mass impacts the bowel, imitating a tumor mass.  This phenomenon is not uncommon in the elderly, and requires prompt recognition and  immediate medical treatment. A 29-year-old woman, known to suffer from mental  retardation, was admitted due to frequent vomiting and diarrhea following  constipation a few days prior to her admission. The patient was treated in her  institution by an enema, with partial decompression, that was followed by recurrent  vomiting and fever. Physical examination upon admittance revealed a distended  abdomen without peritoneal signs. An abdominal X-ray series demonstrated a distended  large bowel with an abundance of fecal contents, and suspected free air in the  abdominal cavity. Due to these findings, an abdominal CT was performed, which  demonstrated a huge fecaloma involving the descending and sigmoid colon. The patient  was treated non-operatively with: IV fluids, oral laxatives, frequent enemas and  manual stool disimpaction. Following this treatment the patient's condition improved  dramatically. Fecaloma is a situation that requires prompt recognition and  treatment. The diagnosis of fecaloma is a clinical challenge. In addition to signs,  symptoms and physical examination, which may be non-specific, the use of X-rays, CT  and US may aid in the diagnosis. The treatment in most cases consists primarily of  hydration, laxatives, enemas and manual disimpaction. If there is no improvement,  one should consider endoscopic treatment, or surgery which may entail a partial or  total colectomy.",

A family is reported where other affected members have presented  with non-specific delayed development or cerebral palsy. The diagnosis should be  considered not only in children with Leigh's encephalopathy, but also in those with  mild neurological dysfunction (including cerebral palsy) if there is a pigmentary  retinopathy or a family history of neurological or ophthalmological disease. There  was some correlation in this family between the disease severity and the proportion  of mutant mtDNA in the blood. This mutation appears to segregate to high levels of  mutant mtDNA rapidly within pedigrees and the mother of a severely affected child  has a high risk of having further children with a high proportion of mutant mtDNA  and a severe phenotype.",

The threshold values of the early evoked  responses provide useful estimates of auditory functioning, even among  difficult-to-test populations, such as deaf-blind children. Latency measures  indicate that the early response is generated at the brain stem. Latency measures  from hearing-impaired subjects show that the response can identify recruitment.  Several subjects having a history of nonspecific communication disorders, e.g.,  dyslexia, exhibited aberrant early evoked response waveforms. The early-evoked  response measures, therefore, amy be useful in detecting and assessing communication  disorders which are believed to be of cortical origin, but now should be considered  to have a basis in brain stem dysfunction.",

        "Abstract": "We report clinical and magnetic resonance imaging findings in two young children,  aged 2 years 4 months and 3 years, with Williams syndrome. Both showed a mild global  delay, although their neurological examination was completely normal. Their magnetic  resonance imaging, however, showed Chiari I malformation and some non-specific  changes in the centrum semiovale and in the white matter posterior to the lateral  ventricles. Cerebellar tonsils were displaced through the foramen magnum 8.5 and 7.5  mm respectively. Our results suggest that Chiari I malformation can also be a  frequent feature in subjects with Williams syndrome even in the absence of overt  neurological signs suggestive of it. Whether these children might develop acute  signs later is not known at present. Further studies are needed not only to evaluate  the incidence of these findings in the global population of subjects with Williams  syndrome but also to identify the children who are at risk for developing acute  neurological signs.",

Episodic  vomiting and drowsiness, acute encephalopathy, failure to thrive and developmental  retardation were common, but focal neurological symptoms and signs were also  observed. The CT appearances were non-specific with generalised or focal changes.  They were related to the severity, the duration and the age of onset of the  hyperammonaemia.

Karyotype-phenotype correlation in other similar  unbalanced trisomies has shown psychomotor retardation, micro- or retrognathia or  both, and low set or malpositioned ears to be the most common features associated  with this newly recognised syndrome. However, after reviewing patients with  duplication of regions 1q2, 3, and 4 and 1q2 and 3, it was concluded that similar  non-specific clinical features are also present in these 1q imbalances. On the  whole, a rather wide range in phenotypical expression has been observed in different  cases. Thus it is concluded that, at present, it is impossible to delineate the  profile of the syndromes resulting from partial 1q trisomies.",

The proband was an 8-year-old boy who presented with hypotonia, severe  intellectual disability and two episodes of seizures associated with/without fever.  Among 7 siblings (4 males, 3 females), the eldest brother had severe intellectual  disability, epilepsy, and sudden death at 17 years of age, while 18-year-old third  elder brother had severe intellectual disability, autism, and drug-resistant  epilepsy. The proband's urinary creatine/creatinine ratio was increased. A reduced  creatine peak on brain magnetic resonance spectroscopy and a known pathogenic  mutation in the SLC6A8 gene (c.1661 C > T;p.Pro554Leu) confirmed the diagnosis of  CRTR-D. The same mutation was found in the third elder brother. Their mother was a  heterozygote. Symptoms of CRTR-D are non-specific. Urinary creatine/creatinine ratio  should be measured in patients with hypotonia, developmental delay, seizure and  autism whose family history indicates an X-linked inheritance.",

In this paper we report sixteen new cases from Europe and North America,  suggesting that Kabuki make-up syndrome may be more common outside of Japan than  supposed. Their features are compared with those of the Japanese patients and most  of our findings are similar to those previously reported. The facial phenotype is  specific and easily recognizable, regardless of ethnic origin. Postnatal growth  retardation and mild mental retardation are confirmed to be cardinal manifestations  of the syndrome. Skeletal anomalies were present in all cases but most of the  radiological changes were non-specific. The specificity of metacarpophalangeal  pattern profile is not confirmed. Conversely, dermatoglyphic analysis is helpful in  the diagnosis of this condition. Two differences have emerged between the Japanese  patients and those in this study. Firstly, two-thirds of the patients in this series  had significant neurological dysfunction other than mental retardation. Secondly,  joint hypermobility appears more common in non-Japanese patients. Confirmation of  these findings requires further studies.",

These individuals have focal  spikes in the EEG similar to the benign rolandic pattern. Female carriers have very  rarely been reported to have epilepsy or nonspecific abnormal EEG patterns. We  report partial seizures with a focal epileptogenic EEG pattern in two sisters and  their grandmother, who are all carriers of fragile-X syndrome. The sisters have mild  developmental delay, but the grandmother is of normal intelligence. The mother of  the two sisters is known to be a carrier of the fragile-X chromosome and is of  normal intelligence, with no history of seizures. It is important for physicians to  be aware of the possibility that females presenting with partial seizures of unknown  cause may be fragile-X carriers, and enquiry for a family history of intellectual  disability should be pursued.",

She was the product of first-cousin  consanguineous marriage. She had striking facies with frontal prominence, deep-set  eyes, depressed nasal bridge, beaked nose, long philtrum with thin upper lip,  micrognathia, large floppy ears, bifid uvula, and growth retardation with SD score  less than -2 for height, weight and head circumference. We believe these features  which include congenital hypoparathyroidism, severe growth failure and developmental  delay in the absence of chromosomal abnormality represent a newly described  genetically determined syndrome.",

Carrier risk estimation using pedigree and haplotype data for five females at  risk is presented, and the difficulties of prenatal diagnosis given linkage to two  different regions is discussed.",

        "Abstract": "Non-specific, cell-mediated and humoral immunity were evaluated in six patients with  different autosomal deletions, and in two patients with X-chromosome deletions. Six  had an increased number of bacterial, viral, and mycotic infections. Mild  disturbances were found in the immunological functions of almost every patient.  Granulocyte phagocytosis and killing of bacteria were normal in all patients. The  chemotactic response was increased in two, and normal in the others. The responses  to phytohaemagglutinin and pokeweed mitogen were normal in all patients and the  response to concanavalin A was decreased in one patient. The lymphocyte response to  purified protein derivative was decreased in the patients as a group when compared  to the controls (P less than 0 . 005), but normal to oidiomycin. The number of  acid-alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase positive cells was low in four patients. One  had a high titre of antinuclear and antithyroid antibodies. One had a low  concentration of serum IgA, C3 and C4. One had a high concentration of IgM. Two had  elevated levels of C3 and C4. Our results show that several different chromosomal  deletions are associated with immunological abnormality.",

The given phenomenon is shown to be similar to the  other forms of pathological habitual actions, especially to onychophagy. The author  demonstrates the nosological nonspecificity of trichotillomania and a great role  played in its origin of minimum brain dysfunction. Provides evidence for the concept  of the biological nature of the phenomenon. Stresses the psychopathological  heterogeneity of trichotillomania in different age groups with emphasis on the  preservation of the common pathogenetic nucleus--the conditioned reflex fixing of  the philogenetic behavioral models. Advances an opinion about the validity of  singling out the definition \"a pathological habitual action\" as an independent  psychopathological sign of certain varieties of trichotillomania.",

The criteria for establishing a diagnosis of encopresis in individuals with MR/DD  are not clear. The literature on encopresis was reviewed for two factors: (1)  definitions according to three major definitional criteria of age, defecation  patterns and etiology; and (2) the relationship between etiology and intervention in  specific, MR/DD, and nonspecific populations. This review yielded no clinical  description of encopresis in MR/DD children, no guidelines for differentiating  encopresis from generalized developmental delay and no substantive treatment  guidelines. Although no definitions or treatment formulations specific to MR/DD were  identified, information and definitional guidelines derived from the general  literature on encopresis are relevant to identification, definition and treatment  issues for MR/DD populations. Interdisciplinary or team approaches are appropriate  for individuals with multiple problems or developmental disorders and intractable  encopresis. An interdisciplinary approach, neurodevelopmental-behavioral  intervention, which was successfully employed with a 5-year-old encopretic child  with multiple developmental problems, is described.",

        "Abstract": "Two female cases, 23- and 21-year-old, of supravalvular aortic stenosis associated  with cerebellar hypoplasia, retinitis pigmentosa and myopathy were reported. No  family history of mental retardation and cardiovascular anomalies was found. There  was no consanguinity between the parents. Pregnancy, labor and delivery were  reported to be uncomplicated. When they visited to our hospital at the age of 13 and  11 years, they had short stature, characteristic facial appearance (eg, wide mouth,  elongated philtrum, low nasal bridge and broad forehead) and supravalvular aortic  stenosis. Neurological examination disclosed mental retardation, retinitis  pigmentosa, muscle wasting and contracture of bilateral knee and ankle joints. Gait  was unsteady and bradykinetic. Their smooth pursuiting ocular movements were  saccadic. No nystagmus was recorded. Mild intention tremor was present. The muscles  were slightly hypotonic, but deep tendon reflexes were hyperactive in the lower  extremities. The sensory system was normal. Results of chromosome analysis and urine  amino acid analysis were normal. The serum creatine kinase was elevated to  1,000-3,000 U. Muscle biopsy revealed nonspecific myopathic changes such as  variability of fiber diameter in both fiber types. Neither cell infiltration nor  deposits of fat or glycogen was found. Cranial MRIs performed at the age of 22 and  20 years disclosed cerebellar hypoplasia and moderate enlargement of the fourth  ventricle. The two cases resembled clinically those of Williams syndrome, but the  MRI findings were not consistent with those of the syndrome. The disorder is  considered to be either Williams syndrome complicated by some other relatively rare  clinical features, or another heredofamilial disease partly resembling Williams  syndrome.",

Chromosome analysis showed her to be a balanced carrier of a t(8;9)(q12;q33)pat  translocation. In addition, she had a de novo deletion of a distal segment of the  long arm of chromosome 7. Seven previously reported cases with deletions involving  7q were reviewed and had a number of nonspecific features in common, with  microcephaly of a comparable degree in one of these. Studies of the Kidd (Jk) blood  groups and Hageman factor were done because of the tentative assignment of their  respective loci to distal 7q. Location of the Kidd (Jk) locus on the deleted segment  can be excluded on the basis of heterozygosity of the proposita for the a and b  alleles. Hageman factor was not decreased, which suggests that this locus is also  not on the deleted segment.",

The first child has a  46,XX,der(4)t(4;5)(p16.3;p15.3)mat and thus has a deletion of 4p16.3-->pter and a  duplication of 5p15.3-->pter (most likely 5p15.31-->pter). Clinical findings include  marked growth retardation, developmental delay, seizure disorder, microcephaly,  unruly hair, broad nasal tip, downturned mouth, narrow palate, 11 pairs of ribs,  mild right club foot, and a deep sacral dimple. Thus, this child has only a few  non-specific manifestations of Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome. The second child has a  46,XY,der(5)t(4;5)(p16.3;p15.3)mat; thus a deletion of 5p15.3-->pter and a  duplication of 4p16.3-->pter. He has failure to thrive, developmental delay,  microcephaly, sparse hair, horizontal nystagmus, short upturned nose with flared  nostrils, thin lips with overhanging upper lip, long fingers and toes, and  hypertonicity. Findings in the second patient are not suggestive of cri du chat  syndrome (del 5p). The mother is phenotypically normal.

OBJECTIVE: To further delineate the phenotypic and mutational spectrum  of the syndrome, by screening oligophrenin 1 in two cohorts of male patients with  mental retardation (MR) with or without known posterior fossa anomalies. METHODS:  Clinical examination, cognitive testing, MRI studies, and mutational analysis  (denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and direct sequencing) on blood lymphocytes  were performed in 213 unrelated affected individuals: 196 patients classified as MRX  and 17 patients with MR and previously detected cerebellar anomalies. RESULTS: Four  novel oligophrenin 1 mutations were identified. In the MRX group, two nonsense  mutations were detected. In the MR group, two mutations were found: a deletion of  exons 16 to 17 and a splice site mutation. All patients shared characteristic  clinical, radiologic, and distinctive features with a degree of intrafamilial  variability in motor and cognitive deficits. CONCLUSIONS: Oligophrenin 1 mutations  were found in 12% (2/17) of individuals with mental retardatin and known cerebellar  anomalies and in 1% (2/196) of the X-linked mental retardation group.",

        "Abstract": "Frequency and type of incontinence and variables associated with incontinence were  assessed in individuals with Angelman syndrome (AS; n=71) and in a matched control  group (n=69) consisting of individuals with non-specific intellectual disability  (ID). A Dutch version of the \"Parental Questionnaire: Enuresis/Urinary Incontinence\"  (Beetz, von Gontard, & Lettgen, 1994) was administered and information on primary  caretakers' perspectives regarding each individual's incontinence was gathered.  Results show that diurnal incontinence and fecal incontinence during the day more  frequently occurred in the control group than in the AS group. In both groups,  nocturnal enuresis was the most common form of incontinence. More incontinence was  seen in individuals with AS who were younger, had a lower level of adaptive  functioning and/or had epilepsy. Individuals with AS were able to stay dry for  longer periods of time than the controls and often showed both in-toilet urination  and urinary accidents during the day, whereas accidents and correct voids during the  day were more set apart in the control group. Also, persons with AS had a lower  micturition frequency implying possible voiding postponement. Both groups showed  high rates of LUTS (lower urinary tract symptoms) possibly indicative of functional  bladder disorders such as voiding postponement, dysfunctional voiding, or even an  underactive bladder. In general, most primary caretakers reported severe  intellectual disability as the main cause for urinary incontinence. Based on these  results incontinence does not appear to be part of the behavioral phenotype of  Angelman syndrome. Therefore, pediatric or urologic diagnostics and treatment are  recommended for all persons with incontinence and intellectual disability. Further  implications for practice and research are given.",

Recently, HECW2 mutations were detected in patients with ID and growth  development disorders. Four de novo missense mutations have been reported. Here, we  report a Japanese girl with Rett-like symptoms of severe ID, hypotonia, refractory  epilepsy, and stereotypical hand movement (hand tapping, flapping, and wringing)  after the age of 1\u202fyear. Characteristically, she had cortical visual impairment. She  had difficulty swallowing since the age of 4\u202fyears, and diminished activity was  noticeable since the age of 12\u202fyears, suggesting neurodevelopmental regression. She  has no acquired microcephaly, and brain magnetic resonance imaging showed  non-specific mild cerebral and cerebellar atrophy without progression over time.  Genetic analyses of MECP2, CDKL5, and FOXG1 were negative. Whole-exome sequencing  analysis revealed a known de novo mutation (c.3988C\u202f>\u202fT) in HECW2. The  characteristics of her clinical symptoms are severe cortical visual impairment and  Rett-like phenotype such as involuntary movements and regression. This is the first  report that patients with HECW2 mutation could show Rett-like feature.",

Despite the detection of robust DcpS decapping activity in cell extract,  minimal to no decapping is detected from human Dcp2 (hDcp2) in extract. We now  demonstrate that one reason for the lack of detectable hDcp2 activity in extract is  due to the presence of inhibitory trans factor(s). Furthermore, we demonstrate that  a previously identified testis-specific protein of unknown function implicated in  nonspecific X-linked mental retardation, VCX-A, can function as an inhibitor of  hDcp2 decapping in vitro and in cells. VCX-A is a noncanonical cap-binding protein  that binds to capped RNA but not cap structure lacking an RNA. Its cap association  is enhanced by hDcp2 to further augment the ability of VCX-A to inhibit decapping.  Our data demonstrate that VCX-A can regulate mRNA stability and that it is an  example of a tissue-specific decapping regulator.",

        "Abstract": "Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a rare and severe, but treatable, inborn  disorder of bile acid biosynthesis and sterol storage with autosomal recessive  inheritance and variable clinical presentation. CTX treatment consists of  chenodeoxycholic acid and must be started as early as possible to prevent permanent  disability. Psychiatric manifestations are rare and non-specific, and often lead to  significant diagnostic and treatment delay. Therefore, better recognition of the  gamut of psychiatric manifestations in CTX can diminish the risk of misdiagnosis and  irreversible neurological deterioration. We hereby describe the psychiatric features  in CTX. A complete review of all published cases of CTX in the medical literature  was undertaken and the case reports with psychiatric presentation were collected and  analyzed. We also describe the psychiatric features in relation to the neurological  semeiology in six patients with CTX diagnosed at the La Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re Hospital. We  conclude that psychiatric manifestations in CTX follow a bimodal/bitemporal pattern,  appearing early in the disease course in the form of a behavioral/personality  disorder associated with learning difficulties or mental retardation, or manifesting  in advanced disease in the setting of dementia as rich neuropsychiatric syndromes,  such as frontal, orbitofrontal or frontotemporal syndromes of cortico-subcortical  dementia encompassing behavioral/personality disturbance, affective/mood disorders  or psychotic disorders. Behavioral/personality disturbance in childhood or  adolescence, especially when accompanied by learning difficulties, should therefore  lead to further investigation to exclude CTX, as early diagnosis and treatment is  critical for prognosis.",

Cognitive performance of fM males  in the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised was worse than that of pM males,  and the deficits in fM females were qualitatively similar, but less severe. In a  visual memory test, both fM groups were impaired. In a list learning test, fM males  were impaired in the learning phase and in delayed recognition. In a logical memory  test, fM males and females were not significantly different from pM subjects.  Hippocampal volumes normalized for intracranial or brain area did not significantly  differ between fM and pM groups. However, positive correlations between left  normalized hippocampal volumes and performance in many delayed memory tests observed  in pM subjects were absent in fM subjects. Furthermore, in > 50% of the fM subjects,  nonspecific changes, such as enlargement of ventricles and perivascular spaces,  focal hyperintensities in temporal pole white matter, and/or subjectively assessed  atypical appearance of hippocampal morphology, were observed in MRI. The data  suggest minor abnormalities in temporal lobe structures in adult fra(X) subjects  with fM.",

        "Abstract": "Of 11 genes involved in nonspecific X-linked mental retardation (MRX), three encode  regulators or effectors of the Rho GTPases, suggesting an important role for Rho  signaling in cognitive function. It remains unknown, however, how mutations in  Rho-linked genes lead to MRX. Here we report that oligophrenin-1, a Rho-GTPase  activating protein that is absent in a family affected with MRX, is required for  dendritic spine morphogenesis. Using RNA interference and antisense RNA approaches,  we show that knock-down of oligophrenin-1 levels in CA1 neurons in rat hippocampal  slices significantly decreases spine length. This phenotype can be recapitulated  using an activated form of RhoA and rescued by inhibiting Rho-kinase, indicating  that reduced oligophrenin-1 levels affect spine length by increasing RhoA and  Rho-kinase activities. We further demonstrate an interaction between oligophrenin-1  and the postsynaptic adaptor protein Homer. Our findings provide the first insight  into how mutations in a Rho-linked MRX gene may compromise neuronal function.",

        "Abstract": "About 80% of female patients with Rett syndrome (RTT) display a mutation in the  methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2) gene, but most males with MECP2 mutation  experience severe fatal encephalopathy or non-specific X-linked mental retardation  (XLMR). The existence of male RTT has been extensively discussed. We report herein a  boy with classic RTT in a family with a missense mutation in MECP2. The mother  exhibited slight mental retardation and was a carrier for R133C. The patient could  stand with support at 12-months-old, and stereotypic hand movements appeared at  3-years-old. He became bed-ridden by 8-years-old. The R133C mutation was present in  MECP2 without somatic mosaicism. A sister with R133C displayed classic RTT. The  R133C mutation has been detected in female patients with classic and preserved  speech variant RTT, but not in males with non-specific XLMR. These results suggest  that clinical phenotypes caused by DNA mutation in MECP2 are determined by position  of the mutation in the gene, and R133 represents a critical amino acid residue in  the induction of RTT symptoms in humans.",

        "Abstract": "Xq28 duplications encompassing MECP2 have been described in male patients with a  severe neurodevelopmental disorder associated with hypotonia and spasticity, severe  learning disability, stereotyped movements, and recurrent pulmonary infections. We  report on standardized brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data of 30 affected  patients carrying an Xq28 duplication involving MECP2 of various sizes (228\u2009kb to  11.7\u2009Mb). The aim of this study was to seek recurrent malformations and attempt to  determine whether variations in imaging features could be explained by differences  in the size of the duplications. We showed that 93% of patients had brain MRI  abnormalities such as corpus callosum abnormalities (n\u2009=\u200920), reduced volume of the  white matter (WM) (n\u2009=\u200912), ventricular dilatation (n\u2009=\u20099), abnormal increased  hyperintensities on T2-weighted images involving posterior periventricular WM  (n\u2009=\u20096), and vermis hypoplasia (n\u2009=\u20095). The occipitofrontal circumference varied  considerably between >+2SD in five patients and <-2SD in four patients. Among the  nine patients with dilatation of the lateral ventricles, six had a duplication  involving L1CAM. The only patient harboring bilateral posterior subependymal nodular  heterotopia also carried an FLNA gene duplication. We could not demonstrate a  correlation between periventricular WM hyperintensities/delayed myelination and  duplication of the IKBKG gene. We thus conclude that patients with an Xq28  duplication involving MECP2 share some similar but non-specific brain abnormalities.  These imaging features, therefore, could not constitute a diagnostic clue. The  genotype-phenotype correlation failed to demonstrate a relationship between the  presence of nodular heterotopia, ventricular dilatation, WM abnormalities, and the  presence of FLNA, L1CAM, or IKBKG, respectively, in the duplicated segment.",

        "Abstract": "White matter (WM) signal abnormalities are demonstrated in various  neurodevelopmental disorders on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The pattern  of WM abnormalities can aid in the diagnostic process. This study aims to  characterize the WM changes found in microdeletion/microduplication syndromes.  Thirteen patients with neurodevelopmental disorders due to copy number variations  were collected from a cohort of children with evidence of WM abnormalities on brain  MRI, in two medical centers. A pediatric neuroradiologist blindly interpreted the  MRI scans. Clinical and genetic findings were retrospectively extracted from the  medical records. WM changes included: multifocal (10/13) periventricular (12/13) and  subcortical (5/13) signal abnormalities and WM volume loss (6/13). Dysgenesis of the  corpus callosum was depicted in 12/13. The main clinical features were: global  developmental delay (13/13), hypotonia (11/13), epilepsy (10/13), dysmorphic  features (9/13), microcephaly (6/13), short stature (6/13), and systemic involvement  (6/13). We showed that different chromosomal micro-rearrangement syndromes share  similar MRI patterns of nonspecific multifocal predominantly periventricular WM  changes associated with corpus callosum dysgenesis with or without WM and gray  matter loss. Hence, the association of these features in a patient evaluated for  global developmental delay/intellectual disability suggests a chromosomal  micro-rearrangement syndrome, and a chromosomal microarray analysis should be  performed.",

        "Abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to develop a rapid, non-radioactive and  effective method for the molecular diagnosis of fragile X syndrome (FXS) by the  polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of the CGG repeat and to establish a protocol to be  used in: a)ruling out FXS in patients with non-specific mental retardation;  b)determining the exact genotype of affected individuals; c)studying all at-risk  individuals from families with FXS and identifying asymptomatic carriers, and  d)offering accurate genetic and reproductive counselling to families with FXS.  MATERIALS AND METHODS: Samples from 438 individuals from 50 families with FXS were  studied using three different PCR tests: the first to detect ethidium bromide  through ultraviolet light, the second to detect digoxigenin and CSPD after blotting  and hybridisation with the (CGG)5 oligoprobe, and the third to amplify and detect  the DXS548 microsatellite. RESULTS: Of the 438 individuals studied, 121 had full  mutations (60 males and 61 females), 86 had pre-mutations (7 males and 79 females),  16 showed mosaic patterns and 215 had no mutations. PCR techniques amplified up to  120-150 repeats, and direct study with probes was required when no bands or only one  band was detected in females. PCR was more accurate than genomic DNA Southern blot  analysis in pre-mutated carriers. In one family, recombination between the FRAXA  locus and the DXS548 microsatellite was found. CONCLUSIONS: These non-radioactive  PCR protocols permit rapid and accurate diagnosis of FXS. They and are especially  useful in prenatal diagnosis and in the identification of carriers.",

The phenotype in  affected females is far more variable and can include developmental differences,  obesity, and characteristic facial and skeletal differences. Cardiac anomalies are  reported in less than 20% of affected males, with cardiomyopathy being one of the  rare but reported complications of this disorder. However, cardiomyopathy is not  well characterized in CLS. Here, we report on a 14-year-old boy with physical and  developmental findings consistent with CLS who presented with a relatively sudden  onset of signs of congestive heart failure due to a restrictive cardiomyopathy; an  endomyocardial biopsy demonstrated non-specific hypertrophic myocyte alterations  consistent with cardiomyopathy. This is the first description of the histology and  electron microscopy of cardiomyopathy in CLS.",

        "Title": "A 3-base pair deletion, c.9711_9713del, in DMD results in intellectual disability  without muscular dystrophy.",
        "Abstract": "We have identified a deletion of 3 base pairs in the dystrophin gene (DMD),  c.9711_9713del, in a family with nonspecific X-linked intellectual disability (ID)  by sequencing of the exons of 86 known X-linked ID genes. This in-frame deletion  results in the deletion of a single-amino-acid residue, Leu3238, in the  brain-specific isoform Dp71 of dystrophin. Linkage analysis supported causality as  the mutation was present in the 7.6\u2009cM linkage interval on Xp22.11-Xp21.1 with a  maximum positive LOD score of 2.41 (MRX85 locus). Molecular modeling predicts that  the p.(Leu3238del) deletion results in the destabilization of the C-terminal domain  of dystrophin and hence reduces the ability to interact with \u03b2-dystroglycan.  Correspondingly, Dp71 protein levels in lymphoblastoid cells from the index patient  are 6.7-fold lower than those in control cell lines (P=0.08). Subsequent  determination of the creatine kinase levels in blood of the index patient showed a  mild but significant elevation in serum creatine kinase, which is in line with  impaired dystrophin function. In conclusion, we have identified the first DMD  mutation in Dp71 that results in ID without muscular dystrophy.",

        "Abstract": "PURPOSE: To determine the point prevalence of active childhood epilepsy in a defined  area and evaluate the usefulness of ILAE classification of seizures, and  epilepsies/syndromes with special interest in severe epilepsies. METHODS: By using  the latest ILAE International Classification of Epileptic Seizures (ICES, 1981) and  Epilepsies and Epileptic Syndromes (ICE, 1989), we determined the age- and  sex-specific prevalence rates of epilepsy, type of seizures, epilepsies, and  recognizable epileptic syndromes, as well as the proportion of severe cases in each  seizure/epilepsy/syndrome category in all children 0-15 years of age from a  geographically defined area in Finland. All medical records, neurophysiological  recordings and available clinical data were reviewed retrospectively. RESULTS: Point  prevalence of active epilepsy on December 12, 1992 was 3.94 per 1,000. According to  ICES/ICE, we were able to classify 96% of seizures and 90% of epilepsies and  syndromes. Generalized seizure and epilepsy/syndrome types were more prevalent in  children 0-6 years of age and partial/localization-related in children 6-15 years of  age. Epilepsy was intractable in 17% of all cases and correlated significantly with  symptomatic etiology and early onset of epilepsy, as well as with additional  neuroimpairments. CONCLUSIONS: A considerable number of cases fell into the  nonspecific categories of ICE, which limits the value of present epilepsy/syndrome  classification in terms of prognosis, prediction, and indication for special  investigations in individual cases. A number of intractable cases was relatively  low, indicating good prognosis in many childhood epilepsies, especially when  additional neuroimpairments are absent.",

        "Abstract": "Creatine is the main source of energy for the brain. Primary creatine deficiency  syndromes (PCDSs) are inborn error of metabolism of creatine synthesis. Symptoms of  central nervous system involvement are the most common clinical manifestations in  these disorders. We reviewed medical records of all genetically confirmed patients  diagnosed by whole exome sequencing who were referred to Myelin and  Neurodegenerative Disorders Clinic, Children's Medical Center, Tehran, Iran, from  May 2016 to Dec 2018. A literature review was conducted on clinical and genomic  variability of PCDS to compare our patients with previously reported cases. We  report two patients with creatine deficiency among a cohort of 550 registered cases  out of which 200 patients had a genetically confirmed neurodegenerative disorder  diagnosis. The main complain in the first patient with creatine transporter (CRTR)  deficiency was seizure and genetic study in this patient identified a novel  hemizygote variant of \"c.92\u2009>\u2009T; p.Pro31Leu\" in the first exon of SLC6A8 gene. The  second patient with guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT) deficiency had an  unknown motor and speech delay as the striking manifestation and molecular assay  revealed a novel homozygote variant of \"c.134G\u2009>\u2009A; p.Trp45*\" in the first exon of  GAMT gene. PCDSs usually are associated with nonspecific neurologic symptoms. The  first presented case had a mean delayed diagnosis of 5\u00a0years. Therefore, in children  with unexplained neurologic features including developmental delay and/or  regression, mental disability and repeated seizures without any significant findings  in metabolic studies, PCDSs can be considered as a differential diagnosis and  molecular analysis can be helpful for the precise diagnosis and treatment.",

        "Title": "Enhancing human spermine synthase activity by engineered mutations.",
        "Abstract": "Spermine synthase (SMS) is an enzyme which function is to convert spermidine into  spermine. It was shown that gene defects resulting in amino acid changes of the wild  type SMS cause Snyder-Robinson syndrome, which is a mild-to-moderate mental  disability associated with osteoporosis, facial asymmetry, thin habitus, hypotonia,  and a nonspecific movement disorder. These disease-causing missense mutations were  demonstrated, both in silico and in vitro, to affect the wild type function of SMS  by either destabilizing the SMS dimer/monomer or directly affecting the hydrogen  bond network of the active site of SMS. In contrast to these studies, here we report  an artificial engineering of a more efficient SMS variant by transferring sequence  information from another organism. It is confirmed experimentally that the variant,  bearing four amino acid substitutions, is catalytically more active than the wild  type. The increased functionality is attributed to enhanced monomer stability,  lowering the pKa of proton donor catalytic residue, optimized spatial distribution  of the electrostatic potential around the SMS with respect to substrates, and  increase of the frequency of mechanical vibration of the clefts presumed to be the  gates toward the active sites. The study demonstrates that wild type SMS is not  particularly evolutionarily optimized with respect to the reaction spermidine \u2192  spermine. Having in mind that currently there are no variations (non-synonymous  single nucleotide polymorphism, nsSNP) detected in healthy individuals, it can be  speculated that the human SMS function is precisely tuned toward its wild type and  any deviation is unwanted and disease-causing.",

        "Title": "The Impact of Developmental Behavioral Pediatrics in a Population of Children with  Down Syndrome.",
        "Abstract": "PURPOSE: Children with Down syndrome (DS) have a unique developmental profile with  an increased risk for co-morbid neurodevelopmental diagnoses, including autism  spectrum disorder (ASD), anxiety, and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder  (ADHD), among others. A delay in a diagnosis of these conditions can impact the  health and psychosocial wellbeing of the child and family. The purpose of this study  was to assess identification of secondary co-morbid neurodevelopmental diagnoses  within an academic DS specialty Clinic. DESIGN AND METHODS: A retrospective chart  review of secondary co-morbid neurodevelopmental diagnoses including children with  DS ages 2 to 17\u00a0years old, with a visit encounter in a pediatric DS specialty clinic  between January 2018 to August 2019 was conducted. Comparisons included diagnoses  identified before (T1) and after (T2) inclusion of developmental behavioral  specialists as pediatric DS providers. Two sample t-tests, Chi-square test and  Fisher's exact t-test were utilized to compare categorical and non-categorical  variables. RESULTS: 145 children were identified in T1 of which 51.7% were male. 225  children were seen in T2, 56.0% were male. Increased detection of several co-morbid  conditions occurred between T1 and T2 including language disorder (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001),  intellectual disability (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), and non-specific developmental/behavioral  diagnoses (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). CONCLUSION: Developmental/behavioral assessment is integral  for detection of co-morbid conditions among a pediatric DS population and prevention  of diagnostic overshadowing. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Interprofessional teams,  including pediatric nurse practitioners, play a key role in providing health  supervision and assessment for a pediatric DS population.",

        "Title": "Mutations in the Chromatin Regulator Gene BRPF1 Cause Syndromic Intellectual  Disability and Deficient Histone Acetylation.",
        "Abstract": "Identification of over 500 epigenetic regulators in humans raises an interesting  question regarding how chromatin dysregulation contributes to different diseases.  Bromodomain and PHD finger-containing protein 1 (BRPF1) is a multivalent chromatin  regulator possessing three histone-binding domains, one non-specific DNA-binding  module, and several motifs for interacting with and activating three lysine  acetyltransferases. Genetic analyses of fish brpf1 and mouse Brpf1 have uncovered an  important role in skeletal, hematopoietic, and brain development, but it remains  unclear how BRPF1 is linked to human development and disease. Here, we describe an  intellectual disability disorder in ten individuals with inherited or de novo  monoallelic BRPF1 mutations. Symptoms include infantile hypotonia, global  developmental delay, intellectual disability, expressive language impairment, and  facial dysmorphisms. Central nervous system and spinal abnormalities are also seen  in some individuals. These clinical features overlap with but are not identical to  those reported for persons with KAT6A or KAT6B mutations, suggesting that BRPF1  targets these two acetyltransferases and additional partners in humans. Functional  assays showed that the resulting BRPF1 variants are pathogenic and impair  acetylation of histone H3 at lysine 23, an abundant but poorly characterized  epigenetic mark. We also found a similar deficiency in different lines of  Brpf1-knockout mice. These data indicate that aberrations in the chromatin regulator  gene BRPF1 cause histone H3 acetylation deficiency and a previously unrecognized  intellectual disability syndrome.",

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) is associated with intellectual  disability, poor social interaction and a high prevalence of psychosis. However, to  date there have been no studies comparing cognition and neuroanatomical  characteristics of 22q11DS with other syndromes to investigate if the cognitive  strengths and difficulties and neuroanatomical differences associated with 22q11DS  are specific to the syndrome. Hence, it is difficult to know if the observed  features of 22q11DS are simply due to a non-specific effect of having a genetic  disorder or are specific to 22q11DS. METHODS: In this study, cognition and brain  anatomy of 12 children with 22q11DS were compared to 12 age, gender and full scale  IQ (FSIQ) matched children with William syndrome (WS) in order to investigate which  cognitive and neuroanatomical features are specific to 22q11DS. We chose WS since  the literature suggests that both groups have areas of  physical/cognitive/behavioural overlap but as yet there has been no direct  comparison of the two groups. RESULTS: Despite being matched on FSIQ the WS group  had significantly greater impairment than those with 22q11DS on tests of Performance  IQ, while performing significantly better on tasks measuring verbal, social and  facial processing skills. Moreover there were significant differences in brain  anatomy. Despite similar overall brain volumes, midline anomalies were more common  among the 22q11DS group, and regional differences such as increased striatal volumes  and reduced cerebellar volumes in the 22q11DS group were detected. CONCLUSIONS:  These findings suggest that although the behavioural phenotype is similar in some  aspects there are key differences in cognition and neuroanatomy between the two  groups. Different neuropsychological profiles need to be considered when designing  educational frameworks for working with these children.",

        "Title": "Dissecting FMR1, the protein responsible for fragile X syndrome, in its structural  and functional domains.",
        "Abstract": "FMR1 is an RNA-binding protein that is either absent or mutated in patients affected  by the fragile X syndrome, the most common inherited cause of mental retardation in  humans. Sequence analysis of the FMR1 protein has suggested that RNA binding is  related to the presence of two K-homologous (KH) modules and an RGG box. However, no  attempt has been so far made to map the RNA-binding sites along the protein sequence  and to identify possible differential RNA-sequence specificity. In the present  article, we describe work done to dissect FMR1 into regions with structurally and  functionally distinct properties. A semirational approach was followed to identify  four regions: an N-terminal stretch of 200 amino acids, the two KH regions, and a  C-terminal stretch. Each region was produced as a recombinant protein, purified, and  probed for its state of folding by spectroscopical techniques. Circular dichroism  and NMR spectra of the N-terminus show formation of secondary structure with a  strong tendency to aggregate. Of the two homologous KH motifs, only the first one is  folded whereas the second remains unfolded even when it is extended both N- and  C-terminally. The C-terminus is, as expected from its amino acid composition,  nonglobular. Binding assays were then performed using the 4-nt homopolymers. Our  results show that only the first KH domain but not the second binds to RNA, and  provide the first direct evidence for RNA binding of both the N-terminal and the  C-terminal regions. RNA binding for the N-terminus could not be predicted from  sequence analysis because no known RNA-binding motif is identifiable in this region.  Different sequence specificity was observed for the fragments: both the N-terminus  of the protein and KH1 bind preferentially to poly-(rG). The C-terminal region,  which contains the RGG box, is nonspecific, as it recognizes the bases with  comparable affinity. We therefore conclude that FMR1 is a protein with multiple  sites of interaction with RNA: sequence specificity is most likely achieved by the  whole block that comprises the first approximately 400 residues, whereas the  C-terminus provides a nonspecific binding surface.",

        "Abstract": "Rett Syndrome, an X-linked dominant neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by  regression of language and hand use, is primarily caused by mutations in  methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2). Loss of function mutations in MECP2 are also  found in other neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism, Angelman-like syndrome  and non-specific mental retardation. Furthermore, duplication of the MECP2 genomic  region results in mental retardation with speech and social problems. The common  features of human neurodevelopmental disorders caused by the loss or increase of  MeCP2 function suggest that even modest alterations of MeCP2 protein levels result  in neurodevelopmental problems. To determine whether a small reduction in MeCP2  level has phenotypic consequences, we characterized a conditional mouse allele of  Mecp2 that expresses 50% of the wild-type level of MeCP2. Upon careful behavioral  analysis, mice that harbor this allele display a spectrum of abnormalities such as  learning and motor deficits, decreased anxiety, altered social behavior and nest  building, decreased pain recognition and disrupted breathing patterns. These results  indicate that precise control of MeCP2 is critical for normal behavior and predict  that human neurodevelopmental disorders will result from a subtle reduction in MeCP2  expression.",

        "Abstract": "Expansion of the FRAXE CCG repeat to a full mutation is associated with methylation  and transcriptional silencing of the FMR2 gene, and as a consequence,  mild-to-borderline mental retardation. FMR2 is a member of a family of four  proteins, AF4, LAF4, FMR2, and AF5q31. The proteins associated with this family  localize to the cell nucleus. Various regions of FMR2, and each of the other members  of the protein family, were cloned and analyzed for transcription activation in  yeast and mammalian cells. In both yeast and mammalian cells, FMR2 showed strong  transcription activation. AF4 activation potential was several-fold lower.  Interestingly, isoforms of both FMR2 and LAF4 lacking exon 3 activated transcription  better than the larger isoforms containing exon 3. Compared with the other members  of the family, activation by FMR2 was the strongest. Our results show that FMR2 is a  potent transcription activator and that its function is conserved. Elucidation of  the function of the FMR2 protein as a transcription activator may place FMR2 within  the molecular signalling pathways involved in nonspecific X-linked mental  retardation (MRX).",

        "Abstract": "Primrose syndrome (PS; MIM# 259050) is characterized by intellectual disability  (ID), macrocephaly, unusual facial features (frontal bossing, deeply set eyes,  down-slanting palpebral fissures), calcified external ears, sparse body hair and  distal muscle wasting. The syndrome is caused by de novo heterozygous missense  variants in ZBTB20. Most of the 29 published patients are adults as characteristics  appear more recognizable with age. We present 13 hitherto unpublished individuals  and summarize the clinical and molecular findings in all 42 patients. Several signs  and symptoms of PS develop during childhood, but the cardinal features, such as  calcification of the external ears, cystic bone lesions, muscle wasting, and  contractures typically develop between 10 and 16\u2009years of age. Biochemically, anemia  and increased alpha-fetoprotein levels are often present. Two adult males with PS  developed a testicular tumor. Although PS should be regarded as a progressive  entity, there are no indications that cognition becomes more impaired with age. No  obvious genotype-phenotype correlation is present. A subgroup of patients with  ZBTB20 variants may be associated with mild, nonspecific ID. Metabolic  investigations suggest a disturbed mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. We suggest a  regular surveillance in all adult males with PS until it is clear whether or not  there is a truly elevated risk of testicular cancer.",

        "Title": "Human chromosome fragility.",
        "Abstract": "Fragile sites are heritable specific chromosome loci that exhibit an increased  frequency of gaps, poor staining, constrictions or breaks when chromosomes are  exposed to partial DNA replication inhibition. They constitute areas of chromatin  that fail to compact during mitosis. They are classified as rare or common depending  on their frequency within the population and are further subdivided on the basis of  their specific induction chemistry into different groups differentiated as folate  sensitive or non-folate sensitive rare fragile sites, and as aphidicolin,  bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) or 5-azacytidine inducible common fragile sites. Most of  the known inducers of fragility share in common their potentiality to inhibit the  elongation of DNA replication, particularly at fragile site loci. Seven folate  sensitive (FRA10A, FRA11B, FRA12A, FRA16A, FRAXA, FRAXE and FRAXF) and two  non-folate sensitive (FRA10B and FRA16B) fragile sites have been molecularly  characterized. All have been found to represent expanded DNA repeat sequences  resulting from a dynamic mutation involving the normally occurring polymorphic  CCG/CGG trinucleotide repeats at the folate sensitive and AT-rich minisatellite  repeats at the non-folate sensitive fragile sites. These expanded repeats were  demonstrated, first, to have the potential, under certain conditions, to form stable  secondary non-B DNA structures (intra-strand hairpins, slipped strand DNA or  tetrahelical structures) and to present highly flexible repeat sequences, both  conditions which are expected to affect the replication dynamics, and second, to  decrease the efficiency of nucleosome assembly, resulting in decondensation defects  seen as fragile sites. Thirteen aphidicolin inducible common fragile sites (FRA2G,  FRA3B, FRA4F, FRA6E, FRA6F, FRA7E, FRA7G, FRA7H, FRA7I, FRA8C, FRA9E, FRA16D and  FRAXB) have been characterized at a molecular level and found to represent  relatively AT-rich DNA areas, but without any expanded repeat motifs. Analysis of  structural characteristics of the DNA at some of these sites (FRA2G, FRA3B, FRA6F,  FRA7E, FRA7G, FRA7H, FRA7I, FRA16D and FRAXB) showed that they contained more areas  of high DNA torsional flexibility with more highly AT-dinucleotide-rich islands than  neighbouring non-fragile regions. These islands were shown to have the potential to  form secondary non-B DNA structures and to interfere with higher-order chromatin  folding. Therefore, a common fragility mechanism, characterized by high flexibility  and the potential to form secondary structures and interfere with nucleosome  assembly, is shared by all the cloned classes of fragile sites. From the clinical  point of view, the folate sensitive rare fragile site FRAXA is the most important  fragile site as it is associated with the fragile X syndrome, the most common form  of familial mental retardation, affecting about 1/4000 males and 1/6000 females.  Mental retardation in this syndrome is considered as resulting from the abolition of  the FMR1 gene expression due to hypermethylation of the gene CpG islands adjacent to  the expanded methylated trinucleotide repeat. FRAXE is associated with X-linked  non-specific mental retardation, and FRA11B with Jacobsen syndrome. There is also  some evidence that fragile sites, especially common fragile sites, are consistently  involved in the in vivo chromosomal rearrangements related to cancer, whereas the  possible implication of common fragile sites in neuropsychiatric and developmental  disorders is still poorly documented.",

        "Title": "The c.429_452 duplication of the ARX gene: a unique developmental-model of limb  kinetic apraxia.",
        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The c.429_452dup24 of the ARX gene is a rare genetic anomaly, leading to  X-Linked Intellectual Disability without brain malformation. While in certain cases  c.429_452dup24 has been associated with specific clinical patterns such as  Partington syndrome, the consequence of this mutation has been also often classified  as \"non-specific Intellectual Disability\". The present work aims at a more precise  description of the clinical features linked to the c.429_452dup24 mutation. METHODS:  We clinically reviewed all affected patients identified in France over a five-year  period, i.e. 27 patients from 12 different families. Detailed cognitive,  behavioural, and motor evaluation, as well as standardized videotaped assessments of  oro-lingual and gestural praxis, were performed. In a sub-group of 13 ARX patients,  kinematic and MRI studies were further accomplished to better characterize the motor  impairment prevalent in the ARX patients group. To ensure that data were specific to  the ARX gene mutation and did not result from low-cognitive functioning per se, a  group of 27 age- and IQ-matched Down syndrome patients served as control. RESULTS:  Neuropsychological and motor assessment indicated that the c.429_452dup24 mutation  constitutes a recognizable clinical syndrome: ARX patients exhibiting Intellectual  Disability, without primary motor impairment, but with a very specific upper limb  distal motor apraxia associated with a pathognomonic hand-grip. Patients affected  with the so-called Partington syndrome, which involves major hand dystonia and  orolingual apraxia, exhibit the most severe symptoms of the disorder. The particular  \"reach and grip\" impairment which was observed in all ARX patients, but not in Down  syndrome patients, was further characterized by the kinematic data: (i) loss of  preference for the index finger when gripping an object, (ii) major impairment of  fourth finger deftness, and (iii) a lack of pronation movements. This lack of distal  movement coordination exhibited by ARX patients is associated with the loss of  independent digital dexterity and is similar to the distortion of individual finger  movements and posture observed in Limb Kinetic Apraxia. CONCLUSION: These findings  suggest that the ARX c.429_452dup24 mutation may be a developmental model for Limb  Kinetic Apraxia.",

        "Title": "The changing purpose of Prader-Willi syndrome clinical diagnostic criteria and  proposed revised criteria.",
        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a complex, multisystem disorder. Its  major clinical features include neonatal hypotonia, developmental delay, short  stature, behavioral abnormalities, childhood-onset obesity, hypothalamic  hypogonadism, and characteristic appearance. The genetic basis of PWS is also  complex. It is caused by absence of expression of the paternally active genes in the  PWS critical region on 15q11-q13. In approximately 70% of cases this is the result  of deletion of this region from the paternal chromosome 15. In approximately 28%, it  is attributable to maternal uniparental disomy (UPD; inheritance of 2 copies of a  chromosome from the mother and no copies from the father, as opposed to the normal 1  copy from each parent) of chromosome 15, and in <2%, it is the result of a mutation,  deletion, or other defect in the imprinting center. Clinical diagnostic criteria  were established by consensus in 1993. Subsequently, definitive molecular genetic  testing became available for laboratory diagnosis of PWS. However, identification of  appropriate patients for testing remains a challenge for most practitioners because  many features of the disorder are nonspecific and others can be subtle or evolve  over time. For example, hypotonic infants who are still in the failure to thrive  phase of the disorder often do not have sufficient features for recognition of PWS  and often are not tested. Initial screening with these diagnostic criteria can  increase the yield of molecular testing for older children and adults with  nonspecific obesity and mental retardation. Therefore, the purpose of clinical  diagnostic criteria has shifted from assisting in making the definitive diagnosis to  raising diagnostic suspicion, thereby prompting testing. We conducted a  retrospective review of patients with PWS confirmed with genetic testing to assess  the validity and sensitivity of clinical diagnostic criteria published before the  widespread availability of testing for all affected patients and recommend revised  clinical criteria. METHODS: Charts of all 90 patients with laboratory-confirmed PWS  were reviewed. For each patient, the presence or absence of the major, minor, and  supportive features listed in the published diagnostic criteria was recorded. The  sensitivity of each criterion, mean of the total number of major and minor criteria,  and mean total score for each patient were calculated. RESULTS: There were 68  patients with a deletion (del 15q11-q13), 21 with maternal UPD of chromosome 15, and  1 with a presumed imprinting defect. Age range at the time of the most recent  evaluation was 5 months to 60 years (median: 14.5 years; del median: 14 years;  range: 5 months-60 years; UPD median: 18 years; range: 5-42 years). The  sensitivities of the major criteria ranged from 49% (characteristic facial features)  to 98% (developmental delay). Global developmental delay and neonatal hypotonia were  the 2 most consistently positive major criteria and were positive in >97% of the  patients. Feeding problems in infancy, excessive weight gain after 1 year,  hypogonadism, and hyperphagia were all present in 93% or more of patients.  Sensitivities of the minor criteria ranged form 37% (sleep disturbance and apneas)  to 93% (speech and articulation defects). Interestingly, the sensitivities of 8 of  the minor criteria were higher than the sensitivity of characteristic facial  features, which is a major criterion. Fifteen out of 90 patients with molecular  diagnosis did not meet the clinical diagnostic criteria retrospectively. CONCLUSION:  When definitive diagnostic testing is not available, as was the case for PWS when  the 1993 criteria were developed, diagnostic criteria are important to avoid  overdiagnosis and to ensure that diagnostic test development is performed on  appropriate samples. When diagnostic testing is available, as is now the case for  PWS, diagnostic criteria should serve to raise diagnostic suspicion, ensure that all  appropriate people are tested, and avoid the expense of testing unnecessarily. Our  results indicate that the sensitivities of most of the published criteria are  acceptable. However, 16.7% of patients with molecular diagnosis did not meet the  1993 clinical diagnostic criteria retrospectively, suggesting that the published  criteria may be too exclusive. A less strict scoring system may ensure that all  appropriate people are tested. Accordingly, we suggest revised clinical criteria to  help identify the appropriate patients for DNA testing for PWS. The suggested age  groupings are based on characteristic phases of the natural history of PWS. Some of  the features (eg, neonatal hypotonia, feeding problems in infancy) serve to diagnose  the syndrome in the first few years of life, whereas others (eg, excessive eating)  are useful during early childhood. Similarly, hypogonadism is most useful during and  after adolescence. Some of the features like neonatal hypotonia and infantile  feeding problems are less likely to be missed, whereas others such as characteristic  facial features and hypogonadism (especially in prepubertal females) may require  more careful and/or expert examination. The issue of who should have diagnostic  testing is distinct from the determination of features among confirmed patients.  Based on the sensitivities of the published criteria and our experience, we suggest  testing all newborns/infants with otherwise unexplained hypotonia with poor suck.  For children between 2 and 6 years of age, we consider hypotonia with history of  poor suck associated with global developmental delay sufficient criteria to prompt  testing. Between 6 and 12 years of age, we suggest testing those with hypotonia (or  history of hypotonia with poor suck), global developmental delay, and excessive  eating with central obesity (if uncontrolled). At the ages of 13 years and above, we  recommend testing patients with cognitive impairment, excessive eating with central  obesity (if uncontrolled), and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and/or typical behavior  problems (including temper tantrums and obsessive-compulsive features). Thus, we  propose a lower threshold to prompt diagnostic DNA testing, leading to a higher  likelihood of diagnosis of this disorder in which anticipatory guidance and  intervention can significantly influence outcome.",

        "Abstract": "Intellectual disability (ID) is characterized by an extraordinary genetic  heterogeneity, with >250 genes that have been implicated in monogenic forms of ID.  Because this complexity precluded systematic testing for mutations and because  clinical features are often non-specific, for some of these genes only few cases or  families have been unambiguously documented. It is the case of the X-linked gene  encoding monoamine oxidase A (MAOA), for which only one nonsense mutation has been  identified in Brunner syndrome, characterized in a single family by mild  non-dysmorphic ID and impulsive, violent and aggressive behaviors. We have performed  targeted high-throughput sequencing of 220 genes, including MAOA, in patients with  undiagnosed ID. We identified a c.797_798delinsTT (p.C266F) missense mutation in  MAOA in a boy with autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit and autoaggressive  behavior. Two maternal uncles carry the mutation and have severe ID, with a history  of maltreatment in early childhood. This novel missense mutation decreases MAOA  enzymatic activity, leading to abnormal levels of urinary monoamines. The  identification of this new point mutation confirms, for the first time since 1993,  the monogenic implication of the MAOA gene in ID of various degrees, autism and  behavioral disturbances. The variable expressivity of the mutation observed in male  patients of this family may involve gene-environment interactions, and the  identification of a perturbation in monoamine metabolism should be taken into  account when prescribing psychoactive drugs in such patients.",

        "Abstract": "Intellectual disability is a common condition with multiple etiologies. The number  of monogenic causes has increased steadily in recent years due to the implementation  of next generation sequencing. Here, we describe a 2-year-old boy with global  developmental delay and intellectual disability. The child had feeding difficulties  since birth. He had delayed motor skills and muscular hypotonia. Brain magnetic  resonance imaging revealed diffuse white matter loss and thinning of the corpus  callosum. Banded karyotype and comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) array were  normal. Whole exome sequencing revealed a novel de novo frameshift mutation  c.3390delA (p.Lys1130Asnfs*4) in KAT6A gene (NM_006766.4). The heterozygous mutation  was confirmed by Sanger sequencing in the patient and its absence in his parents.  KAT6A that encodes a histone acetyltransferase has been recently found to be  associated with a neurodevelopmental disorder autosomal dominant mental retardation  32 (OMIM: no. 616268). Features of this disorder are nonspecific, which makes it  difficult to characterize the condition based on the clinical symptoms alone.  Therefore, our findings confirm the utility of whole exome sequencing to quickly and  reliably identify the etiology of such conditions.",

        "Title": "Neurofibrillary tau depositions emerge with subthreshold cerebral beta-amyloidosis  in down syndrome.",
        "Abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Adults with Down syndrome are genetically predisposed to develop  Alzheimer's disease and accumulate beta-amyloid plaques (A\u03b2) early in life. While A\u03b2  has been heavily studied in Down syndrome, its relationship with neurofibrillary tau  is less understood. The aim of this study was to evaluate neurofibrillary tau  deposition in individuals with Down syndrome with varying levels of A\u03b2 burden.  METHODS: A total of 161 adults with Down syndrome (mean age\u00a0=\u00a039.2 (8.50) years) and  40 healthy, non-Down syndrome sibling controls (43.2 (12.6) years) underwent  T1w-MRI, [C-11]PiB and [F-18]AV-1451 PET scans. PET images were converted to units  of standardized uptake value ratios (SUVrs). A\u03b2 burden was calculated using the  amyloid load metric (A\u03b2(L)); a measure of global A\u03b2 burden that improves  quantification from SUVrs by suppressing the nonspecific binding signal component  and computing the specific A\u03b2 signal from all A\u03b2-carrying voxels from the image.  Regional tau was assessed using control-standardized AV-1451 SUVr.  Control-standardized SUVrs were compared across Down syndrome groups of A\u03b2-negative  (A-) (A\u03b2(L)\u00a0<\u00a013.3), subthreshold A+ (13.3\u00a0\u2264\u00a0A\u03b2(L)\u00a0<\u00a020) and conventionally A+  (A\u03b2(L)\u00a0\u2265\u00a020) individuals. The subthreshold A\u00a0+\u00a0group was identified as having  significantly higher A\u03b2 burden compared to the A- group, but not high enough to  satisfy a conventional A\u00a0+\u00a0classification. RESULTS: A large-sized association that  survived adjustment for chronological age, mental age (assessed using the Peabody  Picture Vocabulary Test), and imaging site was observed between A\u03b2(L) and AV-1451  within each Braak region (p\u00a0<\u00a0.05). The A\u00a0+\u00a0group showed significantly higher  AV-1451 retention across all Braak regions compared to the A- and subthreshold  A\u00a0+\u00a0groups (p\u00a0<\u00a0.05). The subthreshold A\u00a0+\u00a0group showed significantly higher AV-1451  retention in Braak regions I-III compared to an age-matched sample from the A- group  (p\u00a0<\u00a0.05). DISCUSSION: These results show that even the earliest detectable A\u03b2  accumulation in Down syndrome is accompanied by elevated tau in the early Braak  stage regions. This early detection of tau can help characterize the tau  accumulation phase during preclinical Alzheimer's disease progression in Down  syndrome and suggests that there may be a relatively narrow window after A\u03b2  accumulation begins to prevent the downstream cascade of events that leads to  Alzheimer's disease.",

        "Title": "Clinical and genetic analysis for four Chinese families with Prader-Willi syndrome.",
        "Abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a complex, genetic, multisystem disorder. Its major  clinical features include neonatal hypotonia and failure to thrive, mental  retardation, hypogonadism, short hands and feet, hyperphagia-caused obesity, and  characteristic appearance. The genetic basis of PWS is also complex. It is caused by  the absence of expression of the active paternal genes such as the SNRPN, NDN, and  possibly others in the PWS critical region on 15q11-13. PWS is in effect a  contiguous gene syndrome resulting from deletion of the paternal copies of the  imprinted. Consensus in clinical diagnostic criteria was established in 1993.  However, identifying relevant patients for tests remains a challenge for most  practitioners, as many features of the disorder are nonspecific, and others can be  subtle or evolved over time. Consequently, molecular genetic tests can be used to  diagnose PWS accurately, allowing early diagnosis of the syndrome. High resolution  G-banding, high resolution cytogenetic methylation-specific PCR (MS-PCR), and  fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) are routinely used to diagnose PWS. In  this study, four Chinese patients, with typical PWS features, were detected by  MS-PCR and FISH. Three were cytogenetically normal, but lacked paternal expression  of proximal chromosome 15q because of maternal uniparental disomy (UPD). The other  one, however, demonstrated an unbalanced de novo translocation 46, XX, t (7; 15).",

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Even if Wilms' tumour is the commonest primary malignant neoplasia in  children, it maintained a continuous interest due to actual therapeutic successes  contrasting with the customary delayed diagnosis, malignancy and specific risk  factors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two recent illustrative cases from our clinic are  presented. The first one - a little girl of 22 months with repeated admissions for  habitual constipation and psychomental disturbances revealed at abdominal  ultrasonography a hypo-echoic mass at the superior pole of the right kidney. CT  confirmed the presence of a solid homogeneous mass of 23/25 mm without node or  distant metastases, suggestive for Wilms' tumour. Conforming to SIOP protocol she  received chemotherapy and after 4 weeks a superior polar nephrectomy was performed.  Pathology confirmed the diagnosis of triphasic nephroblastoma of intermediary risk.  Postoperative chemotherapy according to the protocol SIOP assured the cure with a  disease free period of 23 months. The second case - also a girl, of 3 years, is  admitted for constipation, pain in the left flank and mental retard (QI=40).  Ultrasonography determined a huge mass (\u00d8~6 cm) situated at the superior pole of the  left kidney. CT attested a nonhomogeneous, encapsulated tumour image of 6.2/5.4/7.2  cm in large posterolateral contact with the renal parenchyma out of which it appears  to be developed. The diagnosis of WT is strongly suggested and after chemotherapy a  radical left nephrectomy with initial vessels ligature was performed. Pathology:  stage IIb nephroblastoma with focal epithelial anaplasia. After surgery she  continued the chemotherapy (HR regime), was cured and excepting a medullar aplasia  is in a good health after 24 months. DISCUSSIONS: Our both cases were girls under 3  years, presenting nonspecific features: constipation and psychic troubles, the  tumour being incidentally discovered by the abdominal ultrasonography. CT  established the diagnosis. Conventional chemotherapy framing adapted to the tumour's  stage and surgery conducted to a stable cure of about two years in both cases.  CONCLUSIONS: Conforming to the SIOP protocols preoperative chemotherapy was  applicable, well-tolerated and efficacious for two recent cases presented in our  clinic, determining the shrinkage of tumour volume and stage and consecutive  reduction of the surgical risks.",

The \"gene dosage  effect\" hypothesis states that the phenotype is a direct result of the cumulative  effect of the imbalance of the individual genes located on the triplicated  chromosome or chromosome region. In a nut shell, the phenotype results directly from  the overexpression of specific chromosome 21 genes. The \"amplified developmental  instability\" hypothesis contends that most manifestations of DS may be interpreted  as the results of a non-specific disturbance of chromosome balance, resulting in a  disruption of homeostasis. This hypothesis was proposed in an attempt to explain the  similarities between the phenotypes of different aneuploid states and the  observation that all of the phenotypic traits in DS are also seen in the general  population but at lower frequency, with less severity and usually only present as a  single trait. Herein, we review recent data and present evidence to support the  theory that the phenotypic traits of aneuploid syndromes, and DS in particular,  result from the increased dosage of genes encoded on the triplicated chromosome.",

Amniocentesis for karyotyping of foetal cells or detection of foetal cell in the  maternal circulation ie, fluorescent in-situ hybridisation (FISH) and karyotyping,  are definitive methods of making the diagnosis antenatally. The cost of doing this  routinely in all pregnancies is prohibitive. This has led to dependence on screening  tests, to select women more likely to be carrying a Down foetus, to offer  karyotyping in a more cost efficient manner. Unfortunately, these screening  criteria, namely maternal age, biochemical markers and ultrasound pointers, are  rather insensitive and miss a large number of cases of Down syndrome. At the same  time they are very non-specific, picking up a large number of false positive cases,  resulting in undue anxiety and unnecessary alarm in a large number of mothers. Till  a non-invasive, definitive test, like FISH can be routinely used in all pregnancies  at affordable costs, accurate antenatal diagnosis on a community basis will be a hit  and miss affair.",

        "Abstract": "Neuropsychiatric disorders vary substantially in age of onset but are best  understood within the context of neurodevelopment. Here, we review opportunities for  intervention at critical points in developmental trajectories. We begin by  discussing potential opportunities to prevent neuropsychiatric disorders. Once  symptoms begin to emerge, a number of interventions have been studied either before  a diagnosis can be made or shortly after diagnosis. Although some of these  interventions are helpful, few are based upon an understanding of pathophysiology,  and most ameliorate rather than resolve symptoms. As such, in the next portion of  the review, we turn our discussion to genetic syndromes that are rare phenocopies of  common diagnoses such as autism spectrum disorder or schizophrenia. Cellular or  animal models of these syndromes point to specific regulatory or signaling pathways.  As examples, findings from the mouse models of Fragile X and Rett syndromes point to  potential treatments now being tested in randomized clinical trials. Paralleling  oncology, we can hope that our treatments will move from nonspecific, like  chemotherapies thrown at a wide range of tumor types, to specific, like the protein  kinase inhibitors that target molecularly defined tumors. Some of these targeted  treatments later show benefit for a broader, yet specific, array of cancers. We can  hope that medications developed within rare neurodevelopmental syndromes will  similarly help subgroups of patients with disruptions in overlapping signaling  pathways. The insights gleaned from treatment development in rare phenocopy  syndromes may also teach us how to test treatments based upon emerging common  genetic or environmental risk factors.",

        "Abstract": "Monosomy 18p refers to a chromosomal disorder resulting from the deletion of all or  part of the short arm of chromosome 18. The incidence is estimated to be about  1:50,000 live-born infants. In the commonest form of the disorder, the dysmorphic  syndrome is very moderate and non-specific. The main clinical features are short  stature, round face with short philtrum, palpebral ptosis and large ears with  detached pinnae. Intellectual deficiency is mild to moderate. A small subset of  patients, about 10-15 percent of cases, present with severe brain/facial  malformations evocative of holoprosencephaly spectrum disorders. In two-thirds of  the cases, the 18p- syndrome is due to a mere terminal deletion occurring de novo,  in one-third the following are possible: a de novo translocation with loss of 18p,  malsegregation of a parental translocation or inversion, or a ring chr18. Parental  transmission of the 18p- syndrome has been reported. Cytogenetic analysis is  necessary to make a definite diagnosis. Recurrence risk for siblings is low in de  novo deletions and translocations, but is significant if a parental rearrangement is  present. Deletion 18p can be detected prenatally by amniocentesis or chorionic  villus sampling and cytogenetic testing. Differential diagnosis may include a wide  number of syndromes with short stature and mild intellectual deficiency. In young  children, deletion 18p syndrome may be vaguely evocative of either Turner syndrome  or trisomy 21. No specific treatment exists but speech therapy and early educational  programs may help to improve the performances of the children. Except for the  patients with severe brain malformations, the life expectancy does not seem  significantly reduced.",

        "Title": "FMR2 expression in families with FRAXE mental retardation.",
        "Abstract": "Normal individuals express the two alternative transcripts, FMR2 and Ox19, from the  FRAXE-associated CpG island. Molecular analysis of the Ox19 transcript suggests that  it is a truncated isoform of the FMR2 gene with an alternative 3' end. Both isoforms  showed a similar pattern of expression, with the Ox19 isoform expressed at a much  lower level. Fibroblasts, chorionic villi and hair roots showed the highest level of  FMR2 expression, whole blood cells and amniocytes showed very low expression, and  the transcript was not detected in lymphoblasts. Fibroblasts of 11 individuals from  seven families segregating FRAXE were assayed for FMR2 expression and FRAXE CpG  island methylation. A man with an unmethylated expansion of 0.6 kb expressed FMR2  and represents a pre-mutation carrier. All chromosomes with FRAXE CCG expansions of  0.8 kb or greater were fully methylated and did not express the FMR2 gene, analogous  to the mechanism of silencing the FMR1 gene in carriers of the FRAXA full mutation.  The boundary between FRAXE pre-mutation and FRAXE full mutation is between 0.7 and  0.8 kb. Two men with absence of FMR2 expression in fibroblasts were not mentally  impaired, suggesting that IQ in some men with FRAXE full mutation may remain within  the normal range. Although molecular tools to study FRAXE non-specific mental  retardation are now available, further psychometric and molecular studies are needed  to characterize the effect of the FRAXE full mutation for the purpose of genetic  counselling.",

However, these models do not provide a  comprehensive explanation for experimental or clinical observations of the effects  of trisomy 21. DS is best viewed as a complex genetic disorder, where the specific  phenotypic manifestations in a given individual are products of genetic,  environmental and stochastic influences. Mouse models that recapitulate both the  genetic basis for and the phenotypic consequences of trisomy provide an experimental  system to define these contributions.",

Performance of 23 young children with Williams syndrome and 30  MA-matched children with developmental disabilities of nonspecific etiologies was  compared on an adaptation of Repacholi and Gopnik's (1997) \"Yummy-Yucky\" task.  Results show that children with Williams syndrome were more likely to mimic and/or  imitate facial affect and vocalizations than children in the mixed comparison group.  Yet, this increased emotional responsivity did not substantially improve  decision-making based on the affective display; children with Williams syndrome were  more likely to attempt to convince the experimenter that the disliked food was  likable. Implications of a social profile that includes enhanced emotional  responsivity paired with impaired perspective taking are discussed.",

        "Abstract": "Impaired sustained attention is considered an important factor in determining poor  functional outcomes across multiple cognitive and behavioural disorders. Sustained  attention is compromised for both children with Williams syndrome (WS) and Down's  syndrome (DS), but specific difficulties remain poorly understood because of  limitations in how sustained attention has been assessed thus far. In the current  study, we compared the performance of typically developing children (N\u202f=\u202f99),  children with WS (N\u202f=\u202f25), and children with DS (N\u202f=\u202f18), on a Continuous  Performance Task - a standard tool for measuring sustained attention. In contrast to  previous studies, primarily focused on overall differences in mean performance, we  estimated the extent to which performance changed over time on task, thus focusing  directly on the sustained element of performance. Children with WS and children with  DS performed more poorly overall compared to typically developing children.  Importantly, measures specific to changes over time differentiated between children  with the two syndromes. Children with WS showed a decrement in performance, whereas  children with Down's syndrome demonstrated non-specific poor performance. In  addition, our measure of change in performance predicted teacher-rated attention  deficits symptoms across the full sample. An approach that captures dynamic changes  in performance over assessments may be fruitful for investigating similarities and  differences in sustained attention for other atypically developing populations.",

        "Abstract": "People with Down's syndrome (DS) are at high risk for developing Alzheimer's disease  (AD) at a relatively young age. This increased risk is not observed in people with  intellectual disabilities for reasons other than DS and for this reason it is  unlikely to be due to non-specific effects of having a neurodevelopmental disorder  but, instead, a direct consequence of the genetics of DS (trisomy 21). Given the  location of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene on chromosome 21, the amyloid  cascade hypothesis is the dominant theory accounting for this risk, with other  genetic and environmental factors modifying the age of onset and the course of the  disease. Several potential therapies targeting the amyloid pathway and aiming to  modify the course of AD are currently being investigated, which may also be useful  for treating AD in DS. However, given that the neuropathology associated with AD  starts many years before dementia manifests, any preventative treatment must start  well before the onset of symptoms. To enable trials of such interventions, plasma,  CSF, brain, and retinal biomarkers are being studied as proxy early diagnostic and  outcome measures for AD. In this systematic review, we consider the prospects for  the development of potential preventative treatments of AD in the DS population and  their evaluation.",

        "Abstract": "Duplications of chromosome region 15q11q13 often occur as a supernumerary chromosome  15. Less frequently they occur as interstitial duplications [dup(15)]. We describe  the clinical and molecular characteristics of three patients with de novo dup(15).  The patients, two males and one female (ages 3-21 years), had nonspecific findings  that included autistic behavior, hypotonia, and variable degrees of mental  retardation. The extent, orientation, and parental origin of the duplications were  assessed by fluorescent in situ hybridization, microsatellite analyses, and  methylation status at D15S63. Two patients had large direct duplications of 15q11q13  [dir dup(15)(q11q13)] that extended through the entire Angelman  syndrome/Prader-Willi syndrome (AS/PWS) chromosomal region. Their proximal and  distal breaks, at D15S541 or D15S9 and between D15S12 and D15S24, respectively, were  comparable to those found in the common AS/PWS deletions. This suggests that  duplications and deletions may be the reciprocal product of an unequal recombination  event. These two duplications were maternally derived, but the origin of the  chromatids involved in the unequal crossing over in meiosis differs. In one patient,  the duplication originated from two different maternal chromosomes, while in the  other patient it arose from the same maternal chromosome. The third patient had a  much smaller duplication that involved only D15S11 and parental origin could not be  determined. There was no obvious correlation between phenotype and extent of the  duplication in these patients.",

        "Abstract": "The comparison of cognitive and linguistic skills in individuals with developmental  disorders is fraught with methodological and psychometric difficulties. In this  paper, we illustrate some of these issues by comparing the receptive vocabulary  knowledge and non-verbal reasoning abilities of 41 children with Williams syndrome,  a genetic disorder in which language abilities are often claimed to be relatively  strong. Data from this group were compared with data from typically developing  children, children with Down syndrome, and children with non-specific learning  difficulties using a number of approaches including comparison of age-equivalent  scores, matching, analysis of covariance, and regression-based standardization.  Across these analyses children with Williams syndrome consistently demonstrated  relatively good receptive vocabulary knowledge, although this effect appeared  strongest in the oldest children.",

        "Abstract": "OBJECTIVES: This study sought to characterize epileptic phenotypes in children with  nonspecific mitochondrial disease (MD) and to evaluate MD diagnostic approaches.  METHODS: A retrospective analysis of the medical, electroencephalogram, and  laboratory records of 142 patients with epilepsy was performed. The patients were  evaluated for MD, and 124 patients were included in the final cohort. The MD  criteria used included an oral glucose lactate stimulation test (OGLST) and urine  organic acid/plasma amino acid (UOA/PAA) assays as metabolic indicators of modified  Walker criteria, as suggested by Bernier et al. (Neurology 59:1406-1411, 2002).  RESULTS: Twenty-two patients were classified as having definite MD (9), probable MD  (5), possible MD (6), or pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) deficiency (3), including one  patient which showed a respiratory chain (RC) defect and PDH deficiency. Seven out  of eight patients in whom significant RC defects were observed showed complex I  defects. In 14 patients, epileptic seizures start at infantile ages. Of 17 patients  who substantially presented generalized seizures, 4 patients started with partial  seizures. Five patients consistently presented only partial seizures. The OGLST and  UOA/PAA assays were useful for a more precise diagnosis of MD, although low positive  predictive value of the OGLST was regrettable. No patient was classified as definite  MD by Walker's original criteria, but the use of our revised MD criteria resulted in  the classification of nine additional patients as definite MD. CONCLUSIONS: MD  manifested considerable diverse epileptic phenotypes and should be considered in the  differential diagnosis of epilepsy in children with unexplained encephalomyopathy  and progressive and fluctuating clinical courses.",

        "Abstract": "Several authors have suggested the existence of an inverse relationship between  bipolar affective disorder and Down's syndrome (DS). The present authors have  examined this hypothesis by a critical review of the literature. The present  findings are consistent with a reduced rate of bipolar disorder in subjects with DS  when compared with non-DS mentally retarded adults and with the general population.  Thus, possession of an extra copy of chromosome 21 may confer protection against  bipolar disorder. This could be the result of non-specific mechanisms or the action  of a disease-modifying gene. However, the most interesting possibility is that  either dominant or recessive alleles act at a major susceptibility locus for bipolar  disorder on chromosome 21. Testable predictions result from the major susceptibility  locus models. In order to investigate these hypotheses further, the present authors  suggest the following: (1) further studies of the prevalence of bipolar disorder in  DS; and (2) the reporting of all cases of bipolar disorder in trisomy 21 with  details of the meiotic origin of the non-disjunction and details about affective  disorder in relatives of the proband.",

        "Title": "Non-invasive prenatal detection of trisomy 21 using tandem single nucleotide  polymorphisms.",
        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Screening tests for Trisomy 21 (T21), also known as Down syndrome, are  routinely performed for the majority of pregnant women. However, current tests rely  on either evaluating non-specific markers, which lead to false negative and false  positive results, or on invasive tests, which while highly accurate, are expensive  and carry a risk of fetal loss. We outline a novel, rapid, highly sensitive, and  targeted approach to non-invasively detect fetal T21 using maternal plasma DNA.  METHODS AND FINDINGS: Highly heterozygous tandem Single Nucleotide Polymorphism  (SNP) sequences on chromosome 21 were analyzed using High-Fidelity PCR and Cycling  Temperature Capillary Electrophoresis (CTCE). This approach was used to blindly  analyze plasma DNA obtained from peripheral blood from 40 high risk pregnant women,  in adherence to a Medical College of Wisconsin Institutional Review Board approved  protocol. Tandem SNP sequences were informative when the mother was heterozygous and  a third paternal haplotype was present, permitting a quantitative comparison between  the maternally inherited haplotype and the paternally inherited haplotype to infer  fetal chromosomal dosage by calculating a Haplotype Ratio (HR). 27 subjects were  assessable; 13 subjects were not informative due to either low DNA yield or were not  informative at the tandem SNP sequences examined. All results were confirmed by a  procedure (amniocentesis/CVS) or at postnatal follow-up. Twenty subjects were  identified as carrying a disomy 21 fetus (with two copies of chromosome 21) and  seven subjects were identified as carrying a T21 fetus. The sensitivity and the  specificity of the assay was 100% when HR values lying between 3/5 and 5/3 were used  as a threshold for normal subjects. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, a targeted approach,  based on calculation of Haplotype Ratios from tandem SNP sequences combined with a  sensitive and quantitative DNA measurement technology can be used to accurately  detect fetal T21 in maternal plasma when sufficient fetal DNA is present in maternal  plasma.",

        "Title": "Brain dysgenesis in Cornelia de Lange syndrome.",
        "Abstract": "The neuropathological findings in a neonatal case of Cornelia de Lange syndrome  (CDLS) were described. Two different types of lesions were revealed in the affected  brain. The first type was classified as perinatal hypoxic-ischemic brain damage,  associated with cyanotic congenital heart anomalies: subarachnoideal,  intraventricular, and parenchymal hemorrhage, and multiple necrosis in the cerebral  white matter, basal ganglia, internal capsule, thalamus, mammillary bodies and  dentate nucleus. This type may be non-specific and common in premature babies dying  soon after birth. On the other hand, the second type was classified as congenital  dysgenesis of the brain: microbrachycephaly, immature or simple convolution pattern  of the cerebral gyri, thickened leptomeninges, persistent subpial granule cells,  hypoplasia of the anterior thalamic nuclei, neurohypophysis, lateral geniculate  body, cerebral peduncle, ventral pons and cerebellar internal granular layer, and  heterotopic cell nests in the cerebellar white matter. This type may indicate that  the maturation of the brain can be disturbed in the fetal period, particularly in  the mid-gestational period. In conclusion, pathognomonic or specific changes of CDLS  might be absent in the brain. However, congenital dysgenesis of the brain,  especially that found in the diencephalon and the cortico-ponto-cerebellar system,  may constitute morphologic evidence explaining the severe growth retardation and  neurological abnormalities in CDLS.",

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The clinical presentation of patients with organic acidurias (OAD) and  urea cycle disorders (UCD) is variable; symptoms are often non-specific.  AIMS/METHODS: To improve the knowledge about OAD and UCD the E-IMD consortium  established a web-based patient registry. RESULTS: We registered 795 patients with  OAD (n\u2009=\u2009452) and UCD (n\u2009=\u2009343), with ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency  (n\u2009=\u2009196), glutaric aciduria type 1 (GA1; n\u2009=\u2009150) and methylmalonic aciduria (MMA;  n\u2009=\u2009149) being the most frequent diseases. Overall, 548 patients (69 %) were  symptomatic. The majority of them (n\u2009=\u2009463) presented with acute metabolic crisis  during (n\u2009=\u2009220) or after the newborn period (n\u2009=\u2009243) frequently demonstrating  impaired consciousness, vomiting and/or muscular hypotonia. Neonatal onset of  symptoms was most frequent in argininosuccinic synthetase and lyase deficiency and  carbamylphosphate 1 synthetase deficiency, unexpectedly low in male OTC deficiency,  and least frequently in GA1 and female OTC deficiency. For patients with MMA,  propionic aciduria (PA) and OTC deficiency (male and female), hyperammonemia was  more severe in metabolic crises during than after the newborn period, whereas  metabolic acidosis tended to be more severe in MMA and PA patients with late onset  of symptoms. Symptomatic patients without metabolic crises (n\u2009=\u200994) often presented  with a movement disorder, mental retardation, epilepsy and psychiatric disorders  (the latter in UCD only). CONCLUSIONS: The initial presentation varies widely in OAD  and UCD patients. This is a challenge for rapid diagnosis and early start of  treatment. Patients with a sepsis-like neonatal crisis and those with late-onset of  symptoms are both at risk of delayed or missed diagnosis.",

        "Title": "Transient myeloproliferative disorder with erythroid differentiation in Down  syndrome.",
        "Abstract": "A newborn with a karyotype of 47, XY, +21 presented at birth with a white blood cell  count of 27 700/microL of which 61% were blast cells. The blast cell morphologic  structure was initially not characteristic of any particular lineage, although the  cytoplasm contained fine granules and occasional small vacuoles. Routine  cytochemical stains were negative, except one for nonspecific esterase that was  faintly positive in most of the blast cells. Flow cytometric analyses showed that  the blast cells expressed glycophorin A with a subset dimly coexpressing CD45 and  were negative for CD34, CD71, myeloid, lymphoid, and platelet-associated antigens.  These immunophenotypic findings were consistent with an abnormal erythroid  phenotype. A few days postpartum, markedly dysplastic erythroid precursor cells  appeared in the peripheral blood and increased in number as the early blast cells  decreased. After a period of subdued blast cell production, a second wave of  increase in the number of blast cells and dysplastic erythroblasts followed and  ended with the disappearance of circulating abnormal cells. The child is now 5 years  old and no major illness has been reported since the remission of this disorder.  This case most likely belongs to the category of transient myeloproliferative  disorders, although the erythroid-like phenotype of blast cells and the evidence of  single-lineage maturation to circulating dysplastic erythroid precursors allow the  suggestion that this process could represent a special form of a self-limited  hematologic disorder in Down syndrome.",

METHODS: Two groups of  eight subjects were matched by gender, chronological and mental age, and nosographic  diagnosis (i.e. autism associated with severe intellectual disability, DSM-IV  criteria and Childhood Autism Rating Scale scored. The TEACCH programme was applied  to the experimental group, while the control group was integrated in regular schools  with a support teacher. The Psycho-Educational Profile-Revised and the Vineland  Adaptive Behaviour Scale were administered twice with a one-year interval between  assessments. RESULTS: The scores of the experimental group increased more than the  control group scores. Statistically significant differences were obtained in both  groups because of the differences in the two approaches.",

She  gave birth to a male infant, chromosomally and phenotypically normal, who died the  day after delivery due to prematurity. Thirty pregnancies of 26 affected mothers,  including the present woman, resulted in 10 children with Down syndrome, 18 children  (1 set of twins) without Down syndrome, and 3 spontaneous abortions. Although rare,  pregnancies in women with Down syndrome could become more frequent, increasing the  importance of genetic, reproductive, and obstetric problems. These problems are  reviewed with special reference to the occurrence of nonspecific abnormalities in  chromosomally normal children, difficulties in labor and delivery, and frequency of  prematurity and low birth weight.",

While in  all age groups complement factors C3, C4 and C5 as well as phagocytosis and NBT  indices were in the normal range, a dysgammaglobulinaemia increasing with age with a  hyperglobulinaemia of the IgG, IgA and IgD types was found, sparing immunoglobulins  IgM and IgE.

Three different polyclonal antibodies with strong tau immunoreactivity are  examined in this study. These antibodies were found to immunostain tangles in normal  aged brain and in brains affected by a range of neurodegenerative disorders,  including Down's syndrome, Alzheimer's disease plus Parkinson's disease, progressive  supranuclear palsy, and the parkinsonism-dementia complex of Guam, as well as Pick  bodies in Pick's disease.

        "Abstract": "We have investigated several aspects of nonspecific immunity in Down syndrome (DS),  utilizing peripheral polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL), obtained from 12 children  aged 8-16, diagnosed as trisomy 21, and their healthy matched controls. We used the  under agarose method for chemotaxis assays, and flow cytometry for the determination  of phagocytosis of monodispersed fluorescent beads, metabolic burst activity, and  neutrophil surface marker expression on these cells. Our results indicate that a  chemotactic defect exists in PMNL of DS children. However, no statistically  significant differences were found between PMNL from DS children and those from  controls in phagocytosis, oxidative burst, and expression of the markers CD11a,  CD11b, CD16, and CD 18. Furthermore, no overexpression of CD11a and CD18 was present  as a consequence of gene overdosage in PMNL from DS children. On the other hand, 3  different neutrophil subpopulations could be observed according to the CD16 staining  pattern in DS children and controls; this might be a consequence of genetic  variation or may represent different states of activation of these cells. Other  factors such as T-cell involvement, and the role of cytokines, cyclic nucleotides,  and zinc serum levels in DS patients should be further investigated in order to  define the causes of the immunological derangement present in this condition.",

        "Abstract": "This study compared adolescents with Down syndrome to nonverbal mental-age matched  controls in their ability to fast map new noun vocabulary in spoken story contexts.  Context for novel words varied within subjects in the distance between mentions  (close-distant) and the ease of inferring a real word for the referent  (specificity). The 23 participants with Down syndrome (DS) were aged 12.8-20.3  years. The 24 typically developing (TD) children, matched on visual nonverbal mental  age (MA), were 4.1 to 6.1 years old. Participants listened to 4 tape-recorded  stories, each containing 3 mentions of 2 novel words in close or distant proximity  and with clear or uncertain reference, and recalled each story after presentation.  Fast-mapping production was measured by the occurrence of the novel word in story  recall. Fast-mapping comprehension was measured by asking children to define the  novel words. The DS group did not differ from the TD group in novel word production  but seemed to have more difficulty with novel word definition. For both groups,  novel word production was higher in the nonspecific than the specific referent  condition, suggesting that availability of a real word label interfered with fast  mapping. Recall of story propositions was poorer for the DS group. For both groups,  story recall was better for text units not directly associated with novel words than  for text units containing novel words, suggesting a trade-off effect in processing.  Regression analyses indicated that syntax comprehension, rather than mean length of  utterance, predicted novel word production in both groups; MA additionally  contributed to predict DS story recall.",

It is characterized by physical and  neurological alterations. In the neonatal period, these alterations can be  nonspecific, which makes early diagnosis a challenge. Diagnosis can be suspected  when there are low levels of ceruloplasmin and serum copper. Molecular analysis  confirms the diagnosis. Treatment is parenteral administration of copper histidine.  We report a familial case with molecular confirmation. The proband had clinical and  biochemical suspicious. Treatment with copper histidine was indicated, but initiated  at the age of 2 months and 27 days only. He did not present improvements and died at  6 months. The mother became pregnant again, a male fetus was identified and copper  histidine was manufactured during pregnancy. He was born healthy, biochemical  markers were reduced and treatment was indicated. Molecular analysis was performed  confirming mutation in both the mother and the proband, while the other son did not  have mutation, so treatment was discontinued. We support the clinical relevance of  molecular confirmation for the correct diagnosis and genetic counseling, once  clinical findings in the neonatal period are nonspecific and early treatment with  parenteral copper histidine must be indicated.",

The cognitive behavioral deficits of Ts65Dn mice  can be rescued by reducing GABAergic inhibition, most selectively by partial inverse  agonists acting on \u03b1(5) GABA-A receptors, of which one compound has recently entered  clinical trials in DS. Most remarkably, the improved cognitive performance of Ts65Dn  can persist for weeks and months after cessation of drug treatment, as demonstrated  for the non-specific GABA antagonist pentylenetetrazole. The Alzheimer drugs,  memantine and donepezil largely fail to show any benefit. Finally, repeated  non-invasive sensory stimulation such as over-training or enriching the environment,  are able to enhance the learning performance which underlines the reversibility of  an obstructed neuronal plasticity in Ts65Dn mice.",

It  demonstrates X-linked recessive inheritance. There is an accumulation of very  long-chain fatty acids (VLCFA) in plasma and all tissues in the process of ALD. No  causal treatment for ALD is known, although hematopoietic stem cell transplantation  (HSCT) and gene therapy are allowed for early diagnosis in childhood cerebral form.  The case report describes three of the brothers suffering from ALD, diagnosed in  different stages of disease. The eldest brother was diagnosed by the age of nine,  with the first symptom of hearing loss. After that, test was also conducted in boy's  younger brother - he was then asymptomatic, however diagnosed with ALD at age 7. The  mutation in the ABCD1 gene was also detected in the mother's blood. Due to the  significant severity of the disease, the eldest boy was not qualified for HSCT.  Nowadays, 2 years after, the health condition of the eldest brother is severe. The  middle brother underwent HSCT. Currently, the he is in a\u00a0good general condition. The  youngest brother had genetic testing performed shortly after birth. The mutation in  the ABCD1 gene also was confirmed, but in this moment there is no regarding to HSCT.  His development is adequally to age, but he has adrenal insufficiency. All of  brothers are treated hydrocortisone. Parental awareness and early genetic tests  (including prenatal tests) are very important because ALD is associated with severe  course and high mortality, and its symptoms are non-specific.",

The children live in the same  environment under identical conditions. In the DS child an earlier and more  extensive gingival inflammation than in her sibling had been observed. Investigation  of nonspecific host defense mechanisms revealed identical results in both children  for the phagocytosis and intracellular killing of Candida albicans by  polymorphonuclear leukocytes in crevicular washings (CR-PMNs), in blood (PB-PMNs)  and blood monocytes. Furthermore, CR- and PB-PMNs were able to secrete identical  amounts of hydrogen peroxide upon stimulation. The chemotactic response of PB-PMNs  in the DS child was impaired, however. The results of the studies performed on  parameters of specific host defense mechanisms showed low blastogenic responses to  phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and pokeweed (PWM) by lymphocytes of the DS child as  compared with her sibling. Also a lack of immune regulation leading to prolonged  helper/inducer cell activation on a local (gingival) and circulation level and a  less pronounced T-cell depression in PB were shown. Together, these differences  observed in specific and nonspecific host response mechanisms may be responsible for  the earlier and more extensive gingival inflammation found in the DS child.",

All patients  were karyotyped. NAP cytochemical procedures were carried out on all subjects;  biochemical NAP determinations were made in 10 patients and 20 controls;  ultrastructural electron microscopy of AP was performed in three patients and four  normal subjects. Neutrophil alkaline phosphatase from patients with trisomy 21  displayed the following changes: (1) a significant increase of enzyme activity, (2)  a high thermal lability of enzyme. Electron microscope morphology exhibited large  deposits of NAP reaction product associated with the plasma membrane and  intracellular main organelles, like phosphasomes. The NAP biochemical and  cytochemical characteristics suggest that trisomy 21 neutrophils contain a  non-specific AP isoenzyme, closely related to the early placental form.",

Here, we characterize a 4.64\u00a0Mb de  novo duplication of the same Xp11.22-p11.23 ID region in a female, but for this  reference case the diagnosis was Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Besides ASD, she  also had very persistent trichotillomania, anxiety symptoms and some non-specific  dysmorphic features. We report the detailed clinical features, as well as refine the  rearrangement breakpoints of this disease-associated copy number variation region,  which encompasses more than 50 genes.

In Experiment 1, the children  with Down syndrome were equally proficient at recognizing unfamiliar faces when  expression was varied but significantly poorer at recognizing expression overall,  with a specific deficit in perceiving surprise and fear. In Experiment 2, using  rotated faces, they were significantly worse at recognizing expression as well as at  identifying known faces. These results, in conjunction with lack of any improvement  with age, suggest that there is a specific deficit in processing facial expressions  associated with Down syndrome, a finding consistent with the emerging picture of  neurological disruption in this syndrome.",

        "Title": "Rett Syndrome Mutant Neural Cells Lacks MeCP2 Immunoreactive Bands.",
        "Abstract": "Dysfunctions of MeCP2 protein lead to various neurological disorders such as Rett  syndrome and Autism. The exact functions of MeCP2 protein is still far from clear.  At a molecular level, there exist contradictory data. MeCP2 protein is considered a  single immunoreactive band around 75 kDa by western-blot analysis but several  reports have revealed the existence of multiple MeCP2 immunoreactive bands above and  below the level where MeCP2 is expected. MeCP2 immunoreactive bands have been  interpreted in different ways. Some researchers suggest that multiple MeCP2  immunoreactive bands are unidentified proteins that cross-react with the MeCP2  antibody or degradation product of MeCP2, while others suggest that MeCP2  post-transcriptional processing generates multiple molecular forms linked to cell  signaling, but so far they have not been properly analyzed in relation to Rett  syndrome experimental models. The purpose of this study is to advance understanding  of multiple MeCP2 immunoreactive bands in control neural cells and p.T158M MeCP2e1  mutant cells. We have generated stable wild-type and p.T158M MeCP2e1-RFP mutant  expressing cells. Application of N- and C- terminal MeCP2 antibodies, and also, RFP  antibody minimized concerns about nonspecific cross-reactivity, since they react  with the same antigen at different epitopes. We report the existence of multiple  MeCP2 immunoreactive bands in control cells, stable wild-type and p.T158M  MeCP2e1-RFP mutant expressing cells. Also, MeCP2 immunoreactive bands differences  were found between wild-type and p.T158M MeCP2e1-RFP mutant expressing cells. Slower  migration phosphorylated band around 70kDa disappeared in p.T158M MeCP2e1-RFP mutant  expressing cells. These data suggest that threonine 158 could represent an important  phosphorylation site potentially involved in protein function. Our results clearly  indicate that MeCP2 antibodies have no cross-reactivity with similar epitopes on  others proteins, supporting the idea that MeCP2 may exist in multiple different  molecular forms and that molecular pattern variations derived from altered  post-transcriptional processing may underlay Rett syndrome physiophatology.",

        "Title": "MN1 C-terminal truncation syndrome is a novel neurodevelopmental and craniofacial  disorder with partial rhombencephalosynapsis.",
        "Abstract": "MN1 encodes a transcriptional co-regulator without homology to other proteins,  previously implicated in acute myeloid leukaemia and development of the palate.  Large deletions encompassing MN1 have been reported in individuals with variable  neurodevelopmental anomalies and non-specific facial features. We identified a  cluster of de novo truncating mutations in MN1 in a cohort of 23 individuals with  strikingly similar dysmorphic facial features, especially midface hypoplasia, and  intellectual disability with severe expressive language delay. Imaging revealed an  atypical form of rhombencephalosynapsis, a distinctive brain malformation  characterized by partial or complete loss of the cerebellar vermis with fusion of  the cerebellar hemispheres, in 8/10 individuals. Rhombencephalosynapsis has no  previously known definitive genetic or environmental causes. Other frequent features  included perisylvian polymicrogyria, abnormal posterior clinoid processes and  persistent trigeminal artery. MN1 is encoded by only two exons. All mutations,  including the recurrent variant p.Arg1295* observed in 8/21 probands, fall in the  terminal exon or the extreme 3' region of exon 1, and are therefore predicted to  result in escape from nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. This was confirmed in  fibroblasts from three individuals. We propose that the condition described here,  MN1 C-terminal truncation (MCTT) syndrome, is not due to MN1 haploinsufficiency but  rather is the result of dominantly acting C-terminally truncated MN1 protein. Our  data show that MN1 plays a critical role in human craniofacial and brain  development, and opens the door to understanding the biological mechanisms  underlying rhombencephalosynapsis.",

        "Abstract": "This paper presents data from a study of 190 parents and discusses their reactions  to being told that their child was likely to be severely mentally handicapped.  Dissatisfaction was related to the child's age when the parents were first told  about the impairment, which was itself related to the diagnosis of the child's  condition. Parents of children with non-specific handicap were often not informed  about the impairment until the second or third year of the child's life, while  parents of children with Down's Syndrome were usually informed within a week of  birth. The paper compares these two groups of parents and discusses the reasons for  their dissatisfaction. The study showed that parents valued early acknowledgement of  the problem, a sympathetic approach on the part of medical professionals, and the  sharing of information and uncertainty. The reasons why parents of mentally  handicapped children may continue to feel dissatisfied are discussed in the light of  the theoretical literature on doctor-patient communication.",

The morphology of the blasts was not  characteristic of myeloid and lymphoid lineage. Cytochemistry showed myeloperoxidase  (MPO), Sudan Black B (SBB), periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) and non-specific esterase  (NSE) negativity. Flowcytometry showed blasts that were positive for CD-33, CD-34  and CD-7. On second follow-up on the 10th day, the same picture persisted on  morphology. On subsequent follow-up, the blasts disappeared. This was thus confirmed  to be a case with transient leukemia with Downs syndrome.",

        "Title": "Segmental trisomy of chromosome 17: a mouse model of human aneuploidy syndromes.",
        "Abstract": "Triplication of whole autosomes or large autosomal segments is detrimental to the  development of a mammalian embryo. The trisomy of human chromosome (Chr) 21, known  as Down's syndrome, is regularly associated with mental retardation and a variable  set of other developmental anomalies. Several mouse models of Down's syndrome,  triplicating 33-104 genes of Chr16, were designed in an attempt to analyze the  contribution of specific orthologous genes to particular developmental features.  However, a recent study challenged the concept of dosage-sensitive genes as a  primary cause of an abnormal phenotype. To distinguish between the specific effects  of dosage-sensitive genes and nonspecific effects of a large number of arbitrary  genes, we revisited the mouse Ts43H/Ph segmental trisomy. It encompasses >310 known  genes triplicated within the proximal 30 megabases (Mb) of Chr17. We refined the  distal border of the trisomic segment to the interval bounded by bacterial  artificial chromosomes RP23-277B13 (location 29.0 Mb) and Cbs gene (location 30.2  Mb). The Ts43H mice, viable on a mixed genetic background, exhibited spatial  learning deficits analogous to those observed in Ts65Dn mice with unrelated trisomy.  Quantitative analysis of the brain expression of 20 genes inside the trisomic  interval and 12 genes lying outside on Chr17 revealed 1.2-fold average increase of  mRNA steady-state levels of triplicated genes and 0.9-fold average down-regulation  of genes beyond the border of trisomy. We propose that systemic comparisons of  unrelated segmental trisomies, such as Ts65Dn and Ts43H, will elucidate the pathways  leading from the triplicated sequences to the complex developmental traits.",

        "Abstract": "In the present study we investigated the co-morbidity of pervasive developmental  disorder (PDD) in 59 Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) individuals and in 59 non-specific  mentally retarded controls, matched for IQ, gender, and age. The 'Pervasive  Developmental Disorder Mentally Retardation Scale' (PDD-MRScale), a screening  questionnaire based on the DSM-III-R criteria for PDD, has been applied in the PWS  group and in the control group. Results of the present study revealed a striking  autistic-like behavioral phenotype in the majority of the PWS individuals,  particularly deficits in the quality of language and communication and of  imagination and interests. This intersection with autistic symptomatology is an  important addition to the behavioral phenotype in PWS persons. A first approach to  delineate subtypes of autistic symptomalogy among PWS persons was performed.  Nineteen percent of the PWS group did meet the full diagnostic DSM-III-R criteria  for PDD in comparison with 15% in the control group. Results revealed that a higher  IQ in PWS does not protect to develop genuine PDD and that uniparental  disomy/imprinting mutation as genetic origin seems to be an additional risk factor  for developing genuine PDD. The results of the present study suggest the importance  of reconsidering the commonly recognized obsessive-compulsive like behavior in PWS  persons within the broader spectrum of autism disorders.",

        "Title": "Epidemiology of prenatal genetic and environmental factors of mental retardation in  cuba.",
        "Abstract": "INTRODUCTION: One of the most sensitive disabilities in human beings is intellectual  disability. In April, 2003, a 10-month study was completed of all persons in Cuba  with mental retardation (MR), producing results that included epidemiological  variables on a national scale. OBJECTIVE: Through follow-up research, this paper  describes and analyzes 4 prenatal factors associated with MR: Down syndrome (DS),  fragile X syndrome (FXS), consanguinity, and maternal alcohol use during pregnancy,  in order to provide recommendations for health system decision-makers on  consolidating prevention strategies at the community level and improving individual  attention to persons with MR. Materials & METHODS: All studies were carried out on  the basis of strict ethical principles. Data for the 4 prenatal factors was gleaned  from the national study's database. Additional data on affected individuals was  obtained through home visits. A previously developed screening instrument was used  for clinical genetic analysis to classify possible MR causal factors as prenatal,  perinatal, postnatal, psychosis, and unclassifiable. Prenatal included causal  factors such as: genetic (by clinical genetic examination, metabolic screening in  urine, and routine karyotypes); nonspecific (evidence of prenatal causal factor  without diagnosis of genetic or environmental etiology); and environmental (prenatal  medical history of biological, physical, or chemical teratogens, endocrine-metabolic  diseases, or other maternal diseases known to affect fetal neurodevelopment).  Frequency, prevalence, and percentages were reported using a descriptive statistical  method. Impact of interventions and actions over time were also compared. RESULTS:  MR prevalence in Cuba is 1.25%, lower than the value of 2%-3% reported in developed  countries. National prevalence of DS was found to be 4.3 per 10,000 population,  representing 22.1% of persons with MR attributed to an ascertained genetic cause.  FXS prevalence in a population of individuals of both sexes with MR, initially  classified as nonspecific prenatal, psychosis, and unclassifiable, was 2.5 per 1,000  of that population; however, in males of the same population, prevalence was 3.7 per  1,000. At this first stage, such results indicate that this syndrome contributes  biologically to the 1.46:1 male/female ratio among the 140,489 individuals with MR.  Maternal alcohol use during pregnancy was found in 4.22% of persons with MR and  consanguinity was present in 6.89% of the population with MR (10.9% of persons with  mild prenatal MR and 14.2% with severe MR). This national data is subdivided by  regions and provinces in this paper. CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of MR in Cuba is lower  than reference values for developed countries. Knowledge generated by this study  about 4 specific causes of MR constitutes pioneering research in the Cuban context,  contributing to the field of medical genetics. The results offer the basis for  formulation of new scientific contributions related to MR genetics as well as  preventive approaches to such genetic factors as consanguinity and to environmental  factors such as maternal alcohol use during pregnancy, which affect or target  embryo-fetal development of the nervous system.",

        "Abstract": "Down syndrome (DS) is often associated with cardiac malformations, so that kidney  damage is little known. The objective of this study was to present the diversity of  renal abnormalities and their potential progression to chronic renal failure. Among  congenital abnormalities of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) abnormalities  appear to be frequent: pyelectasis, megaureters, posterior urethra valves, as well  as renal malformations such as renal hypoplasia, horseshoe kidney, or renal ectopia.  Contributing factors to acute kidney failure have been described in patients with  DS: bilateral lesions and minor renal injury, such as glomerular microcysts, tubular  dilation, and immature glomeruli. Histological lesions can be found, albeit  nonspecific; they occur earlier than in the general population. Two metabolic  specificities have also been described: decreased clearance of uric acid and a  hypercalciuria by passive hyperabsorption. End-stage renal disease can occur, thus  raising the problem of the best choice of management. In conclusion, renal  abnormalities in patients in DS should be known so as to preserve a good renal  functional prognosis: systematic screening with renal ultrasound can be proposed.",

History revealed no  parental exposures to occupational or household adverse factors or nutritional  contaminants. The parents had normal karyotypes. However, a history of urogenital  disease 1-3 years before the affected births was elucidated in all 9 families: three  cases of gonorrhea, one case of trichomoniasis and nonspecific inflammation in the  rest. After visits to genetic counseling clinics torpid urogenital infections were  identified in all 9 couples: nonspecific prostatitis and urethroprostatitis in  fathers, hysterosalpingoophoritis and vaginal dysbacteriosis in mothers.  Teratozoospermia and oligozoospermia with abnormal sperm cell proportions of 56 to  92% occurred in the fathers. It is suggested that infectious-toxic disorders of  chromosomal segregation during the meiosis may be a paternal cause of trisomy 21.  The same mechanism is feasible in mothers. After reversal of urogenital infections  and normalization of spermograms normal infants were born in 7 of 9 families, the  other 2 currently refrain from childbirth.",

        "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Amniocentesis is a popular and effective prenatal diagnostic tool for  chromosomal disorders. It is well-established that the risk of chromosomal  abnormalities increases with maternal age; however, other related indications are  seldom reported. Herein, we report our 30-year experience with amniocentesis from a  single medical center, focusing on the indications and rates of abnormality.  MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective review of 16,749 pregnant women in the  mid-trimester between January 1981 and December 2010 was conducted. The medical  records were analyzed. RESULTS: The indications for amniocentesis were advanced  maternal age (\u2265 34 years old) (n=10,970, 65.5%), increasing-risk maternal  triple-marker Down's screening test (\u2265 1/270) (n=2090, 12.5%), history of abnormal  offspring birth (n=792, 4.7%), abnormal ultrasound findings (n=484, 2.9%), parent  with abnormal karyotype (n=252, 1.5%), family history of chromosomal abnormality  (n=183, 1.1%), drug and radiation exposure (n=165), abnormal chorionic villus  sampling (CVS) results (n=25), intrauterine fetal death (n=50), and other  non-specific causes (n=1662, 9.9%). The rate of abnormality for each indication was  16% in the abnormal CVS group, 12% in the intrauterine fetal death group, 11.5% for  parental chromosomal abnormality, 8.7% in the abnormal ultrasound finding group,  3.0% in the increasing-risk maternal triple-marker Down's screening test group, 2.5%  in the advanced maternal age group, 1.5% for other non-specific causes, 1.4% for  history of abnormal offspring birth, and 1.1% for family history of chromosomal  abnormality. CONCLUSIONS: Both parents with abnormal karyotype and abnormal  ultrasound findings are indications for which consideration of further amniocentesis  is highly recommended.",

Significant differences  between individuals seem to exist. The total frequency of nonspecific terminal  lesions not located on the long arm of the X chromosome was 0.22 +/- 0.17 per cell  in 37 cultures examined. If telomeric lesions on Xq occur in more than 0.7% of the  cells from a single culture in males and more than 1.5% of the cells from a single  culture in females, then this probably indicates a specific fra(X) expression. Lower  percentages may be the result of nonspecific telomeric structural changes in q.

        "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To analyze the clinical characteristics and treatment effects of children  with acute megakaryoblastic leukemia without down syndrome (non-DS-AMKL). METHODS:  The clinical data of 19 children with non-DS-AMKL treated in the Pediatric  Hematology Ward in Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University from May  2008 to April 2018 were analyzed retrospectively. The clinical characteristics,  laboratory test and treatment methods of the children were concluded. All patients  were followed up to evaluate the effect of treatment. RESULTS: The 19 cases of  children included nine male and ten female, the median age of onset was 2 years old.  The clinical manifestations showed nonspecific. The median white blood cell of  peripheral blood was 15.88\u00d710(9)/L, the median hemoglobin was 67 g/L and median  platelet was 16\u00d710(9)/L. An increase of primitive and naive megakaryocytes was found  in the bone marrow sample. The immunophenotypes of bone marrow detected by flow  cytometry in 19 children were all positive expressed for CD41, CD61. Genetic tests  showed that five cases carrying EVI1, including one complicating with MLL/AF10, one  patient carrying HOX11, one carrying GATA1, IKZF1 and DDX11 mutations, one patient  carrying missense mutation of NRAS, one with missense mutation of KRAS and two cases  with high expression of WT1. Karyotype analysis were performed in 11 cases of  children, including four with normal karyotype, four with complex karyotypes, one  with trisomy 8, one with 7/13 trisomy 21 without Down syndrome manifestations  (considered as abnormal somatic karyotype) and one Robertsonian translocation  carrier involving chromosomes 14 and 21. Ten children received treatment, including  three cases with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT)  after complete remission (CR), two cases with complete donor implantation, and one  without implanted but hematopoietic recovered, these three children were followed up  for 26, 15 and 12 months respectively and the minimal residual disease (MRD) were  all less than 10(-4). Another three cases achieving CR after chemotherapy but  relapsed in 5, 10 and 12 months after the onset respectively, and all the three  children were died eventually. One children died of pulmonary hemorrhage during  chemotherapy and three children died from discontinuation of treatment after non  remission. The remaining nine children died because of without chemotherapy  treatment. CONCLUSION: Non-DS-AMKL was rare in children and difficult to be  diagnosed. Determination of MICM classification as early as possible was helpful for  diagnosis, and genetic testing played an important role for diagnosis and prognosis  evaluation. Early hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in patients with CR after  chemotherapy might be an effective way to cure AMKL.",

Historically, the focus of the genetic elucidation of  non-specific ID has been on genes on the X chromosome, and recent research has  brought attention to the growing contribution of autosomal genes. In addition,  next-generation sequencing (NGS) has greatly improved the ability to simultaneously  analyze multiple genetic loci, making large panel testing a practical approach to  testing for non-specific ID. We performed NGS analysis of a total of 90 genes  implicated in non-specific ID. The 90 genes included 56 X-linked genes and 34  autosomal genes. Pathogenic variants were identified in 11 of 52 (21%) patient  samples. Nine of the eleven cases harbored mutations in autosomal genes including  AP4B1, STXB1, SYNGAP1, TCF4 and UBE3A. Our mutation-positive cases provide further  evidence supporting the prevalence of autosomal mutations in patients referred for  non-specific ID testing and the utility of their inclusion in multi-gene panel  analysis.",

        "Title": "WAC-Related Intellectual Disability.",
        "Abstract": "CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: WAC-related intellectual disability (ID) is typically  characterized by variable degrees of developmental delay and/or intellectual  disability. Behavioral abnormalities including anxiety,  attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and/or autism spectrum disorder are  observed in the majority of older children and adults. Most affected infants have  significant but nonspecific features at birth such as neonatal hypotonia and feeding  problems. Some affected individuals come to medical attention with respiratory or  vision problems. Facial features may be mildly dysmorphic, but are nonspecific. To  date, 18 individuals have been identified with WAC-related ID. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING:  The diagnosis of WAC-related ID is established in a proband by identification of a  heterozygous pathogenic variant in WAC on molecular genetic testing. MANAGEMENT:  Treatment of manifestations: Standard treatment of developmental delay /  intellectual disability, behavioral abnormalities, neonatal hypotonia, and feeding  problems. Surveillance: Regular dietary evaluation in infancy to ensure optimal  nutritional status; routine monitoring of developmental progress and educational  needs; assessment for anxiety, attention, and aggressive or self-injurious behavior.  GENETIC COUNSELING: WAC-related ID is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.  With the exception of one family with presumed parental germline mosaicism, all  individuals diagnosed to date have the disorder as the result of a de novo  pathogenic variant. Once the WAC pathogenic variant has been identified in an  affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and  preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Prenatal maternal serum screening for Down's syndrome has  become an important and established part of modern antenatal care. Previously it has  been reported that non-specific immunoreactive inhibin may be useful in this  context. Using a novel assay we have evaluated dimeric inhibin A as a possible  second trimester marker of Down's syndrome. METHODS: From 1992-1993 records, stored  sera from women with Down's affected pregnancies and chromosomally normal control  pregnancies were identified and retrieved for analysis. These sera had been  prospectively collected at 15, 16 and 17 weeks gestation. SUBJECTS: Records revealed  21 women who had had a Down's syndrome pregnancy and who also had serum available  for analysis. Sera from 150 chromosomally normal controls, matched for gestation and  duration of storage, were also retrieved. MEASUREMENTS: Dimeric inhibin A was  measured using a recently developed two-site enzyme-linked immunoassay. This employs  a capture anti inhibin beta A-subunit monoclonal antibody, covalently bound to a  microtitre plate and a second anti inhibin alpha-subunit antibody conjugated to  alkaline phosphatase, allowing detection. RESULTS: The mean (95% CI) maternal serum  dimeric inhibin A in the samples from control pregnancies was 237 (201.5-273.4)  ng/l, 266.9 (235.4-298.5) ng/l and 207.2 (178.5-235.9) ng/l at 15, 16 and 17 weeks  gestation respectively. Expressing the results from the Down's samples as multiples  of the normal median (MoM), the median (95% CI) MoM was 2.6 (2.25-3.57),  significantly higher than the controls (P < 0.0001, Mann-Whitney U-test). In the  sample set tested, for a given false positive rate of 5.3% inhibin A alone afforded  a detection rate of 62%, detecting cases previously undetected by routine screening.  CONCLUSIONS: Dimeric inhibin A appears to be a promising new marker for the prenatal  detection of Down's syndrome. Further prospective evaluation and assessment with  other established markers would now be merited.",

        "Abstract": "Cytogenetic abnormalities with schizophrenia may provide a valuable clue to the  identification of target loci and successful search for major genes. We have  performed chromosomal examinations by using the GTG banding technique on 134  schizophrenics. In 43 patients (32%), random numerical and structural aberrations  were detected. Structural aberrations predominated and usually consisted of  deletions and inversion of various chromosomes. Numerical changes were present in  one or two cells in 14 cases including trizomy 21, marker and acentric chromosomes,  and 47,XXY. The seven cases with pericentric inversion and enlargement of the  heterochromatin region of chromosome 9 (inv(9); 9qh+) were observed in the study.  The incidence (5.2%) of inv(9) and 9qh+ in our schizophrenic patients were found  higher than the general population, suggesting that a susceptibility locus for  schizophrenia may be located at pericentromeric region of chromosome 9. Our study  have detected 1q21, 7q23, inv(9), 9qh+, 11q23, 21q22, 22q11-13 and Xp11-q13  suggested that these chromosomal lesions are prevalent in schizophrenics. The reason  for this might be that these anomalies increase risk for schizophrenia in a  relatively nonspecific way, such as contributing to disruption of normal  embryogenesis of the nervous system.",

        "Title": "Sonographic markers of fetal trisomies: second trimester.",
        "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Second-trimester sonographic findings of fetal trisomy may include  structural abnormalities or sonographic markers of fetal aneuploidy. Unlike  structural anomalies, sonographic markers of fetal aneuploidy are insignificant by  themselves with regard to outcome, are nonspecific--most frequently seen in normal  fetuses, and are often transient. Our objective was to review the second-trimester  sonographic findings of the major trisomic conditions, trisomies 13, 18, and 21.  METHODS: We reviewed a number of the most commonly accepted markers, including  nuchal thickening, hyperechoic bowel, echogenic intracardiac focus, renal  pyelectasis, shortened extremities, mild cerebral ventricular dilatation, and  choroid plexus cysts. Markers associated with trisomy 21 were emphasized. RESULTS:  The sensitivity of sonography for detection of fetal trisomic conditions varies with  the type of chromosome abnormality, gestational age at the time of sonography,  reasons for referral, criteria for positive sonographic findings, and the quality of  the sonography. As an estimate, 1 or more sonographic findings can be identified in  approximately 90% of fetuses with trisomy 13, 80% of fetuses with trisomy 18, and  50% to 70% of fetuses with trisomy 21 (Down syndrome). CONCLUSIONS: The presence or  absence of sonographic markers can substantially modify the risk of fetal Down  syndrome and is the basis of the so-called genetic sonogram. Because maternal  biochemical and sonographic markers are largely independent, combined risk estimates  will result in even higher detection rates than either alone.",

This finding, however, derives mainly from performance on small-scale  laboratory-based tasks. This study investigated large-scale route learning in  individuals with WS and two matched control groups (moderate learning difficulty  group [MLD], typically developing group [TD]). In a non-labelling and a labelling  (verbal information provided along the route) condition, participants were guided  along one of two unfamiliar 1-km routes with 20 junctions, and then retraced the  route themselves (two trials). The WS participants performed less well than the  other groups, but given verbal information and repeated experience they learnt  nearly all of the turns along the route. The extent of improvement in route  knowledge (correct turns) in WS was comparable to that of the control groups.  Relational knowledge (correctly identifying spatial relationships between  landmarks), compared with the TD group, remained poor for both the WS and the MLD  group. Assessment of the relationship between performance on the large-scale  route-learning task and that on three small-scale tasks (maze learning, perspective  taking, map use) showed no relationship for the TD controls, and only a few  non-specific associations in the MLD and WS groups.",

Using autologous plasma or serum as opsonizing media,  phagocytic activity of circulating leukocytes was significantly decreased in DS  subjects. A further decrease of phagocytic activity was found in neutrophils from DS  children, when normal heterologous plasma or sera were used. On the other hand, sera  or plasma from DS subjects significantly increased phagocytic activation of  leukocytes from normal donors. In DS subjects opsonizing agents such as serum  immunoglobulins and complement fractions were in the normal ranges of concentration.  Thus, the impaired chemiluminescence of neutrophils was mainly due to a metabolic  impairment at the cellular level. A decreased production of radicals derived from  the oxygen metabolism in neutrophils may be an important step of immune derangement  leading to the increased incidence of infectious diseases frequently associated with  DS.",

        "Title": "The recurrence of sonographic 'soft markers': ominous sign or 'just' genetics?",
        "Abstract": "OBJECTIVES: 'Soft markers' (SMs) are nonspecific findings that might convey a higher  risk for Down syndrome. We sought to determine the recurrence rate of the most  common SM in subsequent pregnancies. METHODS: This is a retrospective study of all  women who underwent early or late fetal sonographic anatomical screening in our  ultrasound unit. The examined SMs were pyelectasis, thickened nuchal fold (TNF) and  echogenic intracardiac foci (EIF). Data on recurrence and pregnancy outcome were  retrieved retrospectively. RESULTS: The database included 20\u00a0672 singleton  pregnancies; SMs were detected in 2347 (11.1%) of the fetuses and were isolated in  1739 (74%). Rates of solitary findings in the pregnancies were 6.5% (1360/20\u00a0672)  EIF, 3% (624/18\u00a0850) TNF and 1.7% (363/20\u00a0672) pyelectasis. The recurrence rate of  EIF, TNF and pyelectasis in subsequent consecutive pregnancies was 21%, 27% and 16%,  respectively. Overall, 62 cases of Down syndrome were diagnosed in (1\u00a0:\u00a0333  pregnancies). No cases were diagnosed in patients with recurrent SMs. CONCLUSION:  The high recurrence rate of solitary SM implies for genetic predisposition. These  results might improve our counseling for pregnant women affected by the reappearance  of solitary SM. Further studies are needed to assess the likelihood ratio for SM if  recurrence occurs. \u00a9 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

        "Abstract": "Systematic evaluation of ultrasound findings known to be associated with trisomy 21,  at an appropriate gestational age, has been referred to as a genetic sonogram. A  number of high-risk centers performing genetic sonography have reported detection of  ultrasound abnormalities in the majority of fetuses with fetal Down syndrome.  However, nonspecific markers are more commonly observed than structural  abnormalities, which are detected in less than 20% of cases in a nonselected  population. Also, the actual sensitivity of a genetic sonogram will depend on  various factors including the markers sought, gestational age, reasons for referral,  and of course the quality of the ultrasound. Appropriate use of a genetic sonogram  can help to modify the risk of fetal Down syndrome by decreasing the risk when the  ultrasound is normal, or increasing the risk when specific ultrasound markers are  detected. The postultrasound risk can be estimated by applying specific likelihood  ratios, reflecting the strength of individual markers, with the a priori risk based  on maternal age alone, or combined with biochemical markers when known. We review  this approach of age-adjusted ultrasound risk assessment for fetal Down syndrome and  illustrate how the risk can be estimated. Individual sonographic markers are also  discussed.",

        "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Subclinical hypothyroidism occurs in a number of children with Down's  syndrome (DS). The reason for the mildly elevated plasma thyrotropin (TSH)  concentrations is not known. The present study investigated whether decreased TSH  bioactivity plays a role in this phenomenon. DESIGN: A retrospective study of plasma  specimens from DS children with mildly elevated plasma TSH concentrations and  thyroid hormone levels within the reference range, using a TSH receptor-adenylate  cyclase mediated bioassay. METHODS: Strain JP26 Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells,  stable transfected with the human TSH receptor, were incubated with unfractionated  plasma (1/10 diluted in hypotonic incubation medium) of 10 DS children with  subclinical hypothyroidism and nine euthyroid children with insulin-dependent  diabetes mellitus as controls. cAMP released in the incubation medium was measured  by RIA. Mock-transfected CHO cells were used to correct for non-specific CHO  response. WHO Second International Reference Preparation of human TSH was dissolved  and diluted in pooled normal human plasma and simultaneously bioassayed to match  patient and control results. RESULTS: Plasma TSH levels were slightly increased in  DS (mean +/- S.D., 6.5+/-1.3 mU/l, reference range 0.4-4.0 mU/l). Plasma TSH levels  for controls (1.3+/-0.4 mU/l) were within the reference range. Plasma thyroid  hormone levels in patients and controls were normal, plasma TSH binding inhibitory  immunoglobulin and thyroid peroxidase antibodies were negative. cAMP levels  (corrected for non-specific CHO response) in DS patients (18.4+/-3.9 pmol/well) and  in controls (14.3+/-1.3 pmol/well) did not significantly differ from cAMP levels  generated by patient-TSH equivalent TSH standards (16.3+/-0.9 pmol/well).  CONCLUSIONS: The present results demonstrate normal TSH bioactivity in plasma of DS  children, indicating that subclinical hypothyroidism in these patients is of primary  (thyroidal) origin.",

        "Abstract": "The methyl-CpG binding domain (MBD) of the transcriptional repressor MeCP2 has been  proposed to recognize a single symmetrically methylated CpG base pair via  hydrophobic patches on an otherwise positively charged DNA binding surface. We have  tested this binding model by analysis of mutant derivatives of the MeCP2 MBD in  electrophoretic mobility shift assays complemented by NMR structural analysis.  Exposed arginine side chains on the binding face, in particular Arg-111, were found  to be critical for binding. Arg-111 was found to interact with the conserved  aspartate side chain Asp-121, which is proposed to orientate the arginine side chain  to allow specific contacts with the DNA. The conformational flexibility of the  disordered B-C loop region, which forms part of the binding face, was also shown to  be important. In contrast, mutation of the exposed hydrophobic side chains had a  less severe effect on DNA binding. This suggests that the Arg-111 side chain may  contribute to sequence-specific recognition of the CpG site rather than simply  making nonspecific contacts with the phosphate backbone. The majority of missense  mutations within the MBD found in the human genetic disorder Rett syndrome were  shown or predicted to affect folding of the domain rather than the DNA recognition  event directly.",

We evaluated the frequency of all possible combinations  of any one, two, three, or four additional co-occurring birth defects among 736  individuals with trisomy 13 using data from the Texas Birth Defects Registry for  deliveries during 1999-2014. We calculated the observed-to-expected ratio for each  combination, adjusting for the known tendency for birth defects to cluster  non-specifically. To address potential ascertainment differences among live births  and non-live births, we repeated analyses specifically among live births. The  combination of defects with the largest observed-to-expected ratio was  microcephalus, reduction deformities of brain (e.g., holoprosencephaly), anomalies  of nose, and polydactyly. As expected, most of the highest 30 observed-to-expected  ratios involved combinations with documented features of trisomy 13, including  defects of the scalp (e.g., aplasia cutis) and heart. Results were similar among  sensitivity analyses restricted to live births. Our findings may help further  delineate the phenotypic spectrum for trisomy 13 and may inform future research  related to improving screening and counseling for the condition.",

        "Abstract": "Two healthy volunteers were treated with hypoxanthine 3 x 1 g and allopurinol 3 x  100 mg daily for 1 week. During this treatment serum oxypurine concentration and  urinary oxypurine excretion increased as expected. No side effects were observed  except for some mild daytime drowsiness and lethargy. Measurements of urinary  serotonin (5-HT) excretion showed decreases to as much as 60% below initial values.  Decreased urinary 5-HT excretion was also found in a patient with incomplete  Lesch-Nyhan syndrome during treatment with high doses of hypoxanthine. His  neurological symptoms improved slightly. The results suggest that high doses of  hypoxanthine exert a nonspecific sedative effect on both patients with Lesch-Nyhan  syndrome and healthy controls. The cause is probably a reduced synthesis or release  of 5-HT.",

        "Abstract": "Staphylococcus aureus is an important cause of skin infections. We recently  described an outbreak of recurrent furunculosis involving methicillin-resistant S.  aureus among mentally retarded adults. We sought to determine the role of impaired  neutrophil functions in its pathogenesis. Blood neutrophil functions were determined  during both the outbreak (1997) and a disease-free period (2000). Chemotaxis was  measured by migration toward formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP),  specifically and randomly; phagocytosis of opsonized zymosan (OZ) was assessed by  microscopy; superoxide production was determined by cytochrome c reduction in  unstimulated neutrophils and after stimulation with 50 ng/ml phorbol myristate  acetate, 1 mg/ml OZ or 5 x 10(-7)M FMLP. Functions were compared between recurrent  furunculosis (n=10) and non-recurrent furunculosis patients (n=13). During 2000,  functions were normal among the 23 subjects, except for specific/nonspecific  chemotaxis (mean 68%+/-26 and 69%+/-28). During infection, recurrent furunculosis  patients had a significantly increased basal superoxide production as compared to  disease-free period (10.5+/-4.7 vs. 4.9+/-1.9 nmol O(-)(2)/10(6) cells/min,  p=0.003). During the disease-free period, recurrent furunculosis patients had lower  basal superoxide production (4.9+/-1.9 vs. 7.7+/-3.5, p=0.067) and impaired specific  chemotaxis (57%+/-28 vs. 76%+/-21, p<0.05) as compared to non-recurrent furunculosis  patients. Only specific chemotaxis was an independent risk factor for recurrent  furunculosis. Mentally retarded adults have impaired chemotaxis, with recurrent  furunculosis cases having an even greater impairment. Abnormal specific chemotaxis  is an independent risk factor for recurrent furunculosis. Impaired neutrophil  functions thus have a role in the pathogenesis of outbreaks of recurrent  furunculosis.",

        "Abstract": "Acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) are the most frequent illnesses in  pediatric age, frequently experienced in children with Down Syndrome (DS) due to the  associated immune defects of both specific and non-specific immunity. Pidotimod, a  synthetic immunostimulant, was shown to reduce the rates of ARTIs in children with  DS, however the mechanisms associated with this effect is currently unknown. We  analyzed immune parameters in DS children who received the seasonal 2011\u00962012  virosomal-adjuvanted influenza vaccine. Eighteen children aged 3-10 years (mean age  7.1+/-2.6 years) were randomly assigned (1:1 ratio) to receive Pidotimod 400 mg,  administered orally once a day for 90 days or placebo. At the recruitment (T0) all  children received a single dose of virosomal-adjuvanted influenza vaccine (Flu).  Blood samples were collected at T0 and 3 months after the recruitment (T3) in order  to evaluate innate and adaptative immune responses pathway. Flu-specific IgG1 and  IgG3 levels in plasma samples were determined at pre-vaccination (T0), and 1 (T1)  and 3 months (T3) post-vaccination. The use of Pidotimod was associated with the  upregulation of a number of genes involved in the activation of innate immune  responses and in antimicrobial activity. Interestingly the ratio of Flu-specific  IgG1/IgG3 was skewed in pidotimod-treated individuals, suggesting a preferential  activation of complement-dependent effector mechanisms. Although preliminary these  data suggest that Pidotimod can potentiate the beneficial effect of immunization,  possibly resulting in a stronger activity of both innate and adaptive immune  responses.",

        "Abstract": "CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: THOC6 intellectual disability syndrome is associated with  moderate-to-severe developmental delay or intellectual disability; nonspecific  dysmorphic facial features (tall forehead, deep-set eyes, short and upslanted  palpebral fissures, epicanthal folds, and long nose with low-hanging columella);  microcephaly (typically 2-3 SD below the mean); teeth anomalies (dental caries,  malocclusion, and supernumerary teeth); cardiac anomalies (most typically atrial  and/or ventricular septal defects); prenatal ventriculomegaly and hydrocephalus;  cryptorchidism in males; and renal malformations (most commonly unilateral renal  agenesis). More rarely, affected individuals may have hypergonadotropic hypogonadism  (in females), seizures, poor growth, feeding difficulties, hearing loss, refractive  errors and/or other eye abnormalities, vertebral anomalies, micro/retrognathia, and  imperforate / anteriorly placed anus. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of THOC6  intellectual disability syndrome is established in a proband with biallelic  pathogenic variants in THOC6 identified by molecular genetic testing. For  individuals from the Hutterite population suspected of having THOC6 intellectual  disability syndrome, molecular genetic testing for the specific c.136G>A  (p.Gly46Arg) founder variant can be considered. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of  manifestations: For those with poor weight gain, feeding therapy and consideration  of a gastrostomy tube; for those with hearing loss, hearing aids may be considered;  standard treatment for seizures, vision issues, dental caries/malocclusion, cardiac  malformations, genital anomalies, hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, renal  malformations, skeletal anomalies, and developmental delay / intellectual  disability. Surveillance: At each visit: monitor developmental progress, mobility,  self-help skills, and behavior; assess for signs and symptoms of hydrocephalus or  for new neurologic manifestations; measurement of growth parameters and evaluation  of nutritional status; assessment of vision and eye alignment; assessment for dental  caries and malocclusion. Evaluate renal function (BUN, creatinine, and urinalysis)  at each visit or annually for those with anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract;  annual audiology evaluation; evaluation of secondary sexual characteristics and  menstrual cycles at each visit in females older than age 12 years. GENETIC  COUNSELING: THOC6 intellectual disability syndrome is inherited in an autosomal  recessive manner. At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance  of being affected, a 50% chance of being unaffected and a carrier, and a 25% chance  of being unaffected and not a carrier. Carrier testing for at-risk relatives and  prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk are possible if the pathogenic  variants have been identified in an affected family member.",

Although all specimens of hyaluronidase also possessed iduronidase activity, a  separate corrective effect could be attributed to the endo-N-acetyl hexosaminidase  activity of at least one hyaluronidase (Wyeth M-151) for four reasons: (i) its very  low content of iduronidase activity; (ii) a decrease in intracellular macromolecular  mucopolysaccharides (believed to be largely dermatan sulfate) with a corresponding  increase in intracellular and extracellular oligosaccharides; (iii) no measurable  increase in iduronidase activity of hyaluronidase-treated cells despite near maximal  correction; (iv) direct correlation between Hurler cell correction and hyaluronidase  activity when enzymes of different strength were used at less than maximal  correction.",

The results confirm the findings of Iwata et al. [1979] but  add the notion of a relative sparing of the microneurons which represent 40-50% of  the normal neuronal population in the medialis formation and 35-40% in the posterior  formation [Dom 1976]. Although axonal and/or cortical neuronal damage has  contributed some retrograde lesions, a primary thalamic degeneration probably  represents the most important pathogenetic factor. Whether this degeneration results  specifically from the deficiency of enzymes operative in copper metabolism in some  thalamic nuclei only remains purely speculative. Its clinical significance within  the syndrome dominated by a severe psychomotor retardation cannot be evaluated.",

Human lymphocyte cultures can be used for cytogenetic monitoring of genetic  health because many cancers and genetic effects are caused by long-term unhealthy  life-styles. We have investigated the sensitivities of lymphocytes from  inherited-cancer-prone diseases to the induction of the chromosome alterations by  mutagens and carcinogens, and the correlations between the frequency of sister  chromatid exchanges (SCEs) in peripheral lymphocytes and life-styles or daily ways  of living. Lymphocytes from patients with Down syndrome, Fanconi anemia, xeroderma  pigmentosum, ataxia telangiectasia, and Bloom syndromes showed altered (usually  enhanced) susceptibilities to the induction of chromosome aberrations and SCEs by  mutagens and carcinogens in our environments. Mean frequencies of baseline SCEs in  lymphocytes from normal men with poor life-styles have also been shown to be  significantly higher than those in cells from men having good life-styles. The  former cells have further been shown to have hyper sensitivities to the induction of  SCEs by mitomycin-C' treatment compared to latter cells. Unhealthy life-styles also  make the lymphocytes to be more sensitive to ara-C's enhancement of  radiation-induced chromosome aberrations.",

        "Abstract": "SETBP1 mutations are associated with the Schinzel-Giedion syndrome (SGS),  characterized by profound neurodevelopmental delay, typical facial features, and  multiple congenital malformations (OMIM 269150). Refractory epilepsy is a common  feature of SGS. Loss of function mutations have been typically associated with a  distinct and milder phenotype characterized by intellectual disability and  expressive speech impairment. Here we report three variants of SETBP1, two novel de  novo truncating mutations, identified by NGS analysis of an Intellectual Disability  gene panel in 600 subjects with non-specific neurodevelopmental disorders, and one  missense identified by a developmental epilepsy gene panel tested in 56 pediatric  epileptic cases. The three individuals carrying the identified SETBP1 variants  presented mild to severe developmental delay and lacked the cardinal features of  classical SGS. One of these subjects, carrying the c.1765C>T (p.Arg589(*)) mutation,  had mild Intellectual Disability with speech delay; the second one carrying the  c.2199_2203del (p.Glu734Alafs19(*)) mutation had generalized epilepsy, responsive to  treatment, and moderate Intellectual Disability; the third patient showed a severe  cognitive defects and had a history of drug resistant epilepsy with West syndrome  evolved into a Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. This latter subject carries the missense  c.2572G>A (p.Glu858Lys) variant, which is absent from the control population,  reported as de novo in a subject with ASD, and located close to the SETBP1 hot spot  for SGS-associated mutations. Our findings contribute to further characterizing the  associated phenotypes and suggest inclusion of SETBP1 in the list of prioritized  genes for the genetic diagnosis of overlapping phenotypes ranging from non-specific  neurodevelopmental disorders to \"developmental and epileptic encephalopathy\" (DEE).",

We now show immunocytochemically that it is also a component of  neurofibrillary tangles in several other neurodegenerative diseases of diverse  aetiology, including Down's syndrome, dementia pugilistica and postencephalitic  parkinsonism, and in normal ageing. Ubiquitin immunoreactivity is not, however,  generally found in the neurofibrillary tangles of progressive supranuclear palsy.  These findings show that while associated ubiquitin is not a feature unique to the  tangles of Alzheimer's disease, it is not simply a non-specific response to the  presence of an inclusion body within the cell. The observations suggest that  ubiquitin may have an important role in the formation of neurofibrillary tangles in  a variety of neurodegenerative diseases.",

On cerebral angiography, multiple  collateral vessels and rete mirabile (anastomosis of meningeal vessels with internal  cerebral vessels) were noted, in addition to the supraclinoid carotid stenosis.  Computerized tomography revealed nonobstructive hydrocephalus and findings  consistent with multiple vascular insults or infarcts. It is not clear whether moya  moya disease represents a true disease entity (congenital arterial dysplasia) or is  a syndrome caused by nonspecific vascular reaction. Since abnormal vascular  morphology has previously been described in children with trisomy 21, we suggest  that the presence of these two disease entities may not be coincidental. It may  represent a genetic predisposition in Down's syndrome toward vascular abnormalities,  with variable expressivity which manifested itself in this case by abnormalities in  the cerebral circulation.",

The genetic cause of ID remains elusive in the  majority of patients due to this extreme heterogeneity. Whole exome sequencing  technology has been applied to identify pathogenic gene variants responsible for ID.  The present report described a 1.7-year-old female patient who had severe ID with  the specific features of delayed motor development, language disorders and abnormal  facial features. Exome analysis identified a novel pathogenic variant of the SETD5  gene [c.2025_2026delAG (p.Gly676Valfs*2)]. The variant was a frameshift mutation,  causing termination of the protein in advance. These findings indicated that this  mutation of the SETD5 gene may be a genetic cause for ID.

In this report,  we describe three siblings with intellectual disability (ID) or global developmental  delay and a KAT6A heterozygous nonsense mutation, i.e., c.3070C>T (p.R1024*,  ENST00000406337; chr8:41795056G>A on hg19). This mutation was identified by  whole-exome sequencing of all three siblings but not in a healthy sibling. The  mutation was not detected in the peripheral blood of their parents, suggesting the  existence of parental germline mosaicism. The primary symptoms of our patients  included severe to profound ID or global developmental delay, including speech delay  with craniofacial dysmorphism; these symptoms are consistent with symptoms  previously described for patients with KAT6A mutations. Although several features  are common among patients with KAT6A mutations, the features are relatively  nonspecific, making it difficult to establish a clinical entity based on clinical  findings alone. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of cases with  a KAT6A mutation in an Asian population and these cases represent the first reported  instances of germline mosaicism of this disease.",

        "Abstract": "Individuals with Down syndrome have an increased incidence of leukemia compared to  the general population. In addition, Down syndrome children may acquire a  myeloproliferation that resembles acute leukemia that undergoes a spontaneous,  durable remission. To clarify the relationship between these two disorders, the  morphologic, immunophenotypic and cytogenetic characteristics of 28 patients with  Down syndrome and the morphologic manifestations of acute leukemia were examined.  Three cytomorphological groups were discerned. The first two groups consisted of  five patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (group I) and three patients with  acute myeloid leukemia (group II). These leukemias resembled those of non-Down  individuals. The third and largest group (group III) consisted of 20 cases of acute  myeloid leukemia that showed prominent megakaryocytic and/or erythroid  differentiation and occurred in children under 6 years of age. The blasts in this  group were non-reactive for myeloperoxidase or non-specific esterase and expressed  CD7, CD34 and CD36 with variable expression of CD61, CD13 and CD33. Four patients in  this group had an acquired trisomy 8. Four group III leukemias underwent a durable,  spontaneous remission within 2 months of diagnosis. There were no morphologic  differences between those leukemias in this group that progressed and those that  remitted; however, all remissions occurred in newborns. It is concluded that Down  syndrome children acquire a characteristic acute myeloid leukemia that has prominent  megakaryocytic and/or erythroid differentiation and an unusual immunophenotype. This  group of leukemias may undergo a durable, spontaneous remission in the newborn  period.",

        "Abstract": "Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) first consisted of the selection of female  embryos for patients at risk of transmitting X-linked recessive diseases. Advances  in molecular biology now allow the specific diagnosis of almost any Mendelian  disease. For families with an identified X-linked recessive disease-causing  mutation, non-specific diagnosis by sex identification can be considered as a  sub-standard method, since it involves the unnecessary disposal of healthy male  embryos and reduces success rate by diminishing the pool of embryos eligible for  transfer. The most telomeric part of the X-chromosome long arm is a highly gene-rich  region encompassing disease genes such as haemophilia A, X-linked  adrenoleukodystrophy, X-linked hydrocephalus and incontinentia pigmenti. We  developed five single-cell triplex amplification protocols with microsatellite  markers DXS1073, DXS9901 (BGN), G6PD, DXS1108, DXS8087 and F8C-IVS13 located in this  Xq terminal region. These tests allow the diagnosis of all diseases previously  mentioned providing that the genetic material allowing the identification of the  morbid allele can be obtained. The choice of the microsatellite set to use depends  on the localisation of the gene responsible for the diagnosed pathology and on the  informativity of the markers in particular families. Single-cell amplification  efficiency was assessed on single lymphocytes. Amplification rate of the different  markers ranged from 89-97% with an allele drop out rate of 2-19%. So far PGD has  been carried out for three carrier females at risk of transmitting X-linked  adrenoleukodystrophy, X-linked hydrocephalus and hemophilia A. The latter one is now  pregnant.",

This disease is characterized by disrupted bone and  tooth mineralization, and reduced serum AP activity. Along with bone and tooth  symptoms, many neurological symptoms, seizure, encephalopathy, intracranial  hypertension, mental retardation, deafness, and growth hormone deficiency (GHD), are  frequently found in HPP patients. Seizure occurs in severe HPP types soon after  birth, and responds to pyridoxine, but is an indicator of lethal prognosis.  Encephalopathy rarely presents in severe HPP types, but has severe sequelae.  Intracranial hypertension complicated in mild HPP types develops after the age of 1  year and sometimes need neurosurgical intervention. Mental retardation, deafness and  GHD are more frequently found in Japanese HPP patients. Mental retardation occurs in  all HPP types. Deafness in perinatal lethal type is both conductive and  sensorineural. GHD develops in all but perinatal lethal type and the diagnosis tends  to delay. The pathogenesis of these neural features of HPP might be due to  impairment of both vitamin B6 metabolism and central nervous system development by  ALPL mutations.",

        "Abstract": "Social cognitive abilities - notably, Theory of Mind (ToM) and social information  processing (SIP) - are key skills for the development of social competence and  adjustment. By understanding affective and cognitive mental states and processing  social information correctly, children will be able to enact prosocial behaviors, to  interact with peers and adults adaptively, and to be socially included. As social  adjustment and inclusion are major issues for children with intellectual  disabilities (IDs), the present study aimed to explore their social cognitive  profile by combining cluster analysis of both ToM and SIP competence, and to  investigate the structure of relations between these skills in children with IDs.  Seventy-eight elementary school children with non-specific IDs were recruited. They  had a chronological age ranging from 4 years and 8 months to 12 years and 6 months  and presented a preschool developmental age. Performance-based measures were  administered to assess ToM and SIP abilities. Questionnaires were completed by the  children's parents to evaluate the children's social competence and adjustment and  their risk of developing externalizing or internalizing behaviors. Exploratory  analysis highlighted strengths and weaknesses in the social cognitive profiles of  these children with IDs. It also emphasized that the understanding of affective and  cognitive mental states was used differently when facing appropriate vs.  inappropriate social behaviors. The present study leads to a better understanding of  the socio-emotional profile of children with IDs and offers some suggestions on how  to implement effective interventions.",

        "Abstract": "Data from the world literature about the pathology of the urinary system in  autosomal chromosomal disorders are analyzed and compared with our own morphological  investigations of this system in 63 cases of chromosomal disorders (Patau's,  Edwards', Down's, Orbeli's, Wolf-Hirschhorn's syndromes, partial trisomy B and  inversion of chromosome 2). The urinary system is most frequently involved in  \"cat-eye\", triploidy, Orbeli's, Patau's and Edwards' syndromes. All known  malformations of the urinary system are observed in children with chromosomal  diseases, except infantile polycystic kidney and medullary \"sponge\" kidney. The  authors recognize specific and nonspecific abnormalities of the urinary system.  Nonspecific abnormalities, as simple renal dysgenesis, may be observed in all  chromosomal disorders. Specific abnormalities are found only in certain chromosomal  diseases. These malformations are an excess of embryonal lobulation of the kidney  with the increase of its weight and cystic changes (Patau's syndrome), crossed renal  ectopy with fusion and horseshoe kidney (Edwards' syndrome), unilateral renal  agenesis (Orbeli's syndrome), hypospadia (Wolf-Hirschhorn's syndrome). A possible  pathogenesis of malformations of the urinary system in chromosomal disorders is  discussed.",

        "Abstract": "Beta-propeller protein-associated neurodegeneration (BPAN) is one of the  neurodegenerative disorders characterized by iron deposition in the brain and is the  only known disease in humans to be caused by an aberration in autophagocytosis.  Here, we present the case of a 42-year-old woman with BPAN identified by the WDR45  mutation. From early childhood, she was recognized as having global developmental  delay, and she frequently sucked her hand, which was considered to be a  stereotypical movement. She had a febrile convulsion at 6 months of age but there  was no history of epilepsy. The delay in language development was more severe than  the delay in motor development; she was able to dress herself, walk unaided, and  follow simple instructions until adolescence. After the age of 20, her movement  ability rapidly declined. By the time she was 42 years old, she was bedridden and  unable to communicate. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 21 years revealed  no abnormality except non-specific cerebral atrophy. However, MRI at 39 years  revealed abnormalities in the globus pallidus and substantia nigra, with  neurodegeneration and iron accumulation in the brain. Genetic analysis for WDR45  revealed that she had a splice site mutation (NM_007075.3: c.830 + 2 T > C) which  was previously reported, and a diagnosis of BPAN was confirmed. For specific  therapies to be developed for BPAN in the future, it is necessary to establish early  diagnosis, including genetic analysis.",

Biochemical studies of biopsied muscles and  skin fibroblasts demonstrated markedly decreased pyruvate dehydrogenase complex  (PDHC) activity to about 16% of normal value. Muscle histochemistry in both patients  showed disorganized intermyofibrillar networks containing large diformazan granules  on NADH-TR, small angulated fibers with high nonspecific esterase (NSE) activity and  basophilic fibers. Ragged-red fibers and increased lipid droplet accumulation were  absent. Patient 1 had increased numbers of type 2C fibers (11.3%) and mild fiber  type grouping. On electron microscopy, most mitochondria were nearly normal. There  were focal aggregates of mildly enlarged mitochondria in the subsarcolemmal areas in  both patients. Morphometric study showed that the mean mitochondrial size and the  mitochondrial percentage of fiber volume were not significantly different amongst  patients and normal controls.",

Because of this complexity, a gender-specific approach for comprehensive  MECP2 gene testing is described. Briefly, sequencing of exons 1 to 4 of MECP2 is  recommended for patients with a Rett syndrome phenotype, unexplained neonatal  encephalopathy, an Angelman syndrome phenotype (with negative 15q11-13 analysis),  nonspecific mental retardation, or autism (females). Additional testing for  large-scale MECP2 deletions is recommended for patients with Rett syndrome or  Angelman syndrome phenotypes (with negative 15q11-13 analysis) following negative  sequencing. Alternatively, testing for large-scale MECP2 duplications is recommended  for males presenting with mental retardation, an X-linked family history of  developmental delay, and a significant proportion of previously described clinical  features (particularly a history of recurrent respiratory infections).",

Her  mother and sisters also suffered from IP. She had generalized tonic seizures at 1  month of age, and infantile spasms at 7 months. ACTH therapy was very effective to  infantile spasms. At 9 years now, she is suffering from atypical absence, mild  mental retardation and mild left hemiparesis. MRI revealed marked atrophy of the  cerebral white matter predominantly around the posterior horn of right lateral  ventricle, cystic lesions in the white matter around the anterior horns of both  lateral ventricles, which were not clear by CT scan, and atrophy of the right  cerebral peduncle and pontine basis. Although these findings are non-specific, they  may be clues which explicate the mechanism of central nervous system involvement in  incontinentia pigmenti.",

The ocular malformations, generally of a minor nature,  comprise a variety of nonspecific hyperplasia or hamartomata, hypoplasias, tissue  defects and heterotopias, and involve virtually every portion of the globe. Ocular  and extraocular abnormalities in Down's syndrome do not correlate well  embryologically, cytogenetically or in regard to incidence or severity. The type of  ocular anomalies usually encountered in trisomy 21 suggests that the globe was  affected by the chromosomal anomaly rather late in its development.",

        "Abstract": "Thiamine, in the form of thiamine pyrophosphate, is a cofactor for a number of  enzymes which play important roles in energy metabolism. Although dietary thiamine  deficiency states have long been recognised, it is only relatively recently that  inherited defects in thiamine uptake, activation and the attachment of the active  cofactor to target enzymes have been described, and the underlying genetic defects  identified. Thiamine is transported into cells by two carriers, THTR1 and THTR2, and  deficiency of these results in thiamine-responsive megaloblastic anaemia and  biotin-responsive basal ganglia disease respectively. Defective synthesis of  thiamine pyrophosphate has been found in a small number of patients with episodic  ataxia, delayed development and dystonia, while impaired transport of thiamine  pyrophosphate into the mitochondrion is associated with Amish lethal microcephaly in  most cases. In addition to defects in thiamine uptake and metabolism, patients with  pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency and maple syrup urine disease have been described  who have a significant clinical and/or biochemical response to thiamine  supplementation. In these patients, an intrinsic structural defect in the target  enzymes reduces binding of the cofactor and this can be overcome at high  concentrations. In most cases, the clinical and biochemical abnormalities in these  conditions are relatively non-specific, and the range of recognised presentations is  increasing rapidly at present as new patients are identified, often by genome  sequencing. These conditions highlight the value of a trial of thiamine  supplementation in patients whose clinical presentation falls within the spectrum of  documented cases.",

        "Abstract": "Argininosuccinic acid lyase (ASL) deficiency, caused by mutations in the ASL gene  (OMIM: 608310) is a urea cycle disorder that has pleiotropic presentations. On the  mild end, ASL deficiency can manifest as nonspecific neurocognitive abnormalities  without readily identifiable signs to differentiate it from other causes of  intellectual disability or learning disabilities. Dietary management and arginine  supplementation, if initiated early, may ameliorate symptoms.Because of the  nonspecific nature of the symptoms and the possibility for therapeutic management,  ASL deficiency is part of the recommended uniform screening panel for newborn  screening in the USA. We report here a case of ASL deficiency that was missed on  newborn screening in the USA.The case reported here has two known pathogenic  mutations - one with no residual activity and one with reported 10% residual  activity. Review of this newborn screening results showed subtle elevation of  citrulline, overlapping the normal range. These findings suggest that newborn  screening may be missing other patients with ASL deficiency with at least one  hypomorphic allele. This case was diagnosed incidentally, but in retrospect had  symptoms best attributed in full or in part to his ASA deficiency, including protein  aversion, developmental delay, and seizures. This case highlights the importance of  considering ASL deficiency in patients with nonspecific abnormal neurocognitive  signs, such as epilepsy and developmental delay, even when newborn screening was  normal.",

        "Abstract": "Premature ovarian failure (POF) is the occurrence of hypergonadotropic  hypoestrogenic amenorrhoea in women under the age of 40 years. POF is idiopathic in  74-90% of cases but can be familial (4-33%) or sporadic. The known causes are:  genetic aberrations; autoimmune ovarian damage; iatrogenic following surgery,  radiotherapy or chemotherapy; environmental factors (viruses, toxins, etc.); and  metabolic (galactosaemia, 17 OH deficiency, etc.) Genetic aberrations could involve  the X chromosome (monosomy, trisomy or translocations) or be autosomal. Genetic  mechanisms include reduced gene dosage and non-specific chromosome effect impairing  meiosis, decreasing the pool of primordial follicles and increasing atresia due to  apoptosis or failure of follicle maturation. The genes for POF-1 are localized to Xq  21.3-Xq27 and for POF-2 to Xq13.3-21.1. The FMR1 gene is responsible for the fragile  X syndrome. It occurs due to CGG expansion of more than 55 repeats at the 5'UTR (Xq  27.3), which is associated with gene silence resulting in mental retardation in  males, and POF in female carriers. Autoimmune ovarian damage is caused by the  alteration of T-cell subsets and T-cell-mediated injury, increase of autoantibody  producing B-cells and a low number of effector suppressor/cytotoxic lymphocyte and a  decrease of number and activity of natural killer cells. POF can be associated with  other non-endocrine and endocrine diseases. The mutations of AIRE gene are  responsible for polyendocrinopathies (APS I-III). As the cause of POF is unknown in  the majority of cases and the number of women with POF is increasing, the primary  goal of scientific groups worldwide should be focused on the study of the aetiology  of POF.",

        "Abstract": "Initial studies of immunoreactive inhibin using a commercial assay have shown levels  to be increased in three second-trimester series of maternal samples from Down's  syndrome-affected pregnancies. This assay detected non-specifically all forms of  circulating inhibin, dimeric and free alpha subunits, whether fully or partially  processed. More recently, a new specific assay for dimeric inhibin-A has shown  elevated results in both a first-trimester and a second-trimester series of cases.  In order to assess the value of dimeric inhibin-A as a potential marker in the  second trimester, we have analysed 157 Down's syndrome cases and used 367 unaffected  cases across the gestational range 14-20 weeks to establish control medians and  population parameters. In our series, the median MOM in Down's cases was 1.77,  significantly higher than in the controls. At a 5 per cent false-positive rate,  dimeric inhibin-A alone identified 37 per cent of cases. When used in conjunction  with maternal age and other marker combinations, mathematical modelling showed  detection rates rising from 48 per cent (inhibin-A plus age) to 61 per cent  (inhibin-A, free beta hCG, age) and 68 per cent (inhibin-A, AFP, free beta hCG,  age). Our data suggest that dimeric inhibin-A may have greater potential earlier in  gestation when median levels at 14-16 weeks are 1.92 compared with 1.46 at 17-23  weeks. Dimeric inhibin-A may be a valuable addition to screening protocols,  particularly in early gestations.",

        "Title": "ARID1B-Related Disorder.",
        "Abstract": "CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: ARID1B-related disorder (ARID1B-RD) constitutes a clinical  continuum, from classic Coffin-Siris syndrome to intellectual disability with or  without nonspecific dysmorphic features. Coffin-Siris syndrome is classically  characterized by aplasia or hypoplasia of the distal phalanx or nail of the fifth  and additional digits, developmental or cognitive delay of varying degree,  distinctive facial features, hypotonia, hypertrichosis, and sparse scalp hair.  Frequencies of other features, such as developmental delay (with speech often more  affected than motor development), is consistent across the clinical spectrum, and  may include malformations of the cardiac, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and/or  central nervous systems. Other findings seen in individuals with ARID1B-RD include  feeding difficulties, slow growth, ophthalmologic abnormalities, hearing impairment,  seizures, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and autistic features.  DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of ARID1B-RD is established by identification of a  heterozygous pathogenic variant in ARID1B by molecular genetic testing. MANAGEMENT:  Treatment of manifestations: Standard treatment for strabismus, refractive error,  hearing loss, congenital heart defects, obstructive sleep apnea, constipation,  gastroesophageal reflux, cryptorchidism, scoliosis, and seizure disorders. For  significant feeding issues, a nasogastric and/or gastrostomy tube may be required.  Developmental therapies, including speech/language and feeding therapy, is  recommended for those with developmental delay. Surveillance: At least annual  assessment of developmental progress and educational needs; annual ophthalmology  evaluation and assessment for scoliosis (until growth is complete). Audiology  evaluation, behavior assessment, and hormonal evaluation/bone age as needed based on  symptoms. Those with seizures should be monitored as clinically indicated. GENETIC  COUNSELING: ARID1B-related disorder is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion.  With the exception of two families in which a parent and child had features  consistent with ARID1B-related disorder, all individuals diagnosed to date have the  disorder as the result of a de novo pathogenic variant. Once the ARID1B pathogenic  variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal and  preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

        "Title": "Anti-gamma interferon can prevent the premature death of trisomy 16 mouse cortical  neurons in culture.",
        "Abstract": "Previous reports have indicated that human trisomy 21 and mouse trisomy 16 neurons  exhibit decreased viability in culture when compared to euploid control cultures and  that trisomic cells are significantly more sensitive to the anti-cellular effects of  the interferons. In the study reported here, cortical neurons from euploid and  trisomy 16 mouse fetuses were treated with either anti-gamma-interferon or  non-specific IgG and neuron morphology and viability measured photographically. The  addition of anti-gamma-interferon IgG to the culture media had no effect on euploid  neurons, but significantly increased trisomy neuron viability throughout the 5-day  culture period. Assay of both DNA fragmentation and phosphatidylserine  externalization suggested that the trisomic neurons were undergoing apoptosis at a  significantly higher rate than their euploid counterparts and that this increase in  apoptosis could be almost completely prevented by addition of either ligand purified  monoclonal or ligand purified polyclonal anti-gamma-interferon IgG. Taken together,  these data suggest that endogenous interferon plays an important role in the  premature death of the trisomy neuron.",

        "Title": "Two Novel Mutations of ANKRD11 Gene and Wide Clinical Spectrum in KBG Syndrome: Case  Reports and Literature Review.",
        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: KBG syndrome (OMIM #148050) is a rare, autosomal dominant inherited  genetic disorder caused by heterozygous mutations in the ankyrin repeat  domain-containing protein 11 (ANKRD11) gene or by microdeletion of chromosome  16q24.3. It is characterized by macrodontia of the upper central incisors,  distinctive facial dysmorphism, short stature, vertebral abnormalities, hand anomaly  including clinodactyly, and various degrees of developmental delay. KBG syndrome  presents with variable clinical feature and severity among individuals. Here, we  report two KBG patients who have different novel heterozygous mutations of ANKRD11  gene with wide range of clinical manifestations. CASE PRESENTATION: Two novel  heterozygous mutations of ANKRD11 gene were identified in two unrelated Korean  patients with variable clinical presentations. The first patient presented with  short stature and early puberty and was treated with growth hormone and  gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist without adverse effects. He had mild  intellectual disability. In targeted exome sequencing, a novel de novo frameshift  variant was identified in ANKRD11, c.5889del, and p. (Ile1963MetfsX9). The second  patient had severe intellectual disability with epilepsy. He had normal height and  prepubertal stage at the age of 11 years. He had behavioral problems such as  autism-like features, anxiety, and stereotypical movements. Whole exome sequencing  (WES) was performed, and the novel heterozygous mutation, c3310dup, p.  (Glu110GlyfsTer5) in ANKRD11 was identified. CONCLUSION: KBG syndrome is often  underdiagnosed because of its non-specific features and phenotypic variability.  Performing a next-generation sequencing panel, including the ANKRD11 gene for cases  of developmental delay with/without short stature may be helpful to identify  hitherto undiagnosed KBG syndrome patients.",

We describe here two sisters with a 46,XY karyotype and a  microdeletion of the oligophrenin-1 gene and 1.1 Mb of flanking DNA. We have  characterised the molecular interval defining this microdeletion syndrome with the  fibre-FISH technique. A visual physical map of 1.2 Mb was constructed which spans  the oligophrenin-1 gene and the androgen receptor gene. The analysis of the patients  revealed a deletion which extended from the 5' end of the AR gene to a region  approximately 80 kb proximal to the EPLG2 gene. The clinical manifestations of the  two sisters include psychomotor retardation, seizures, ataxia, hypotonia and  complete androgen insensitivity. Cranial MRI scans show enlargement of the cerebral  ventricles and cerebellar hypoplasia. Our findings give further support for the  involvement of the oligophrenin-1 gene in specific morphological abnormalities of  the brain which is of importance in the investigation of male patients presenting  with mental retardation. In combination with our results from physical mapping we  suggest that a region around the oligophrenin-1 locus is relatively bereft of vital  genes.",

        "Title": "MED12-Related Disorders.",
        "Abstract": "CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: MED12-related disorders include the phenotypes of FG  syndrome type 1 (FGS1), Lujan syndrome (LS), X-linked Ohdo syndrome (XLOS), Hardikar  syndrome (HS), and nonspecific intellectual disability (NSID). FGS1 and LS share the  clinical findings of cognitive impairment, hypotonia, and abnormalities of the  corpus callosum. FGS1 is further characterized by absolute or relative macrocephaly,  tall forehead, downslanted palpebral fissures, small and simple ears, constipation  and/or anal anomalies, broad thumbs and halluces, and characteristic behavior. LS is  further characterized by large head, tall thin body habitus, long thin face,  prominent nasal bridge, high narrow palate, and short philtrum. Carrier females in  families with FGS1 and LS are typically unaffected. XLOS is characterized by  intellectual disability, blepharophimosis, and facial coarsening. HS has been  described in females with cleft lip and/or cleft palate, biliary and liver  anomalies, intestinal malrotation, pigmentary retinopathy, and coarctation of the  aorta. Developmental and cognitive concerns have not been reported in females with  HS. Pathogenic variants in MED12 have been reported in an increasing number of males  and females with NSID, with affected individuals often having clinical features  identified in other MED12-related disorders. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of an  MED12-related disorder is established in a male by identification of a hemizygous  MED12 pathogenic variant on molecular genetic testing. The diagnosis of an  MED12-related disorder is established in a female with suggestive findings and a  heterozygous pathogenic variant in MED12 identified by molecular genetic testing.  MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Early individualized education; physical  therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy for developmental delays;  individualized management of behavior problems; routine management of seizures,  strabismus and other ocular anomalies, imperforate anus, chronic constipation, joint  contractures, genitourinary anomalies, congenital heart defects, hearing loss,  palate anomalies, and dental anomalies; social work support. Treatment of aneurysms,  intestinal malrotation, and liver disease in females with HS as recommended by the  appropriate specialist. Surveillance: At each visit, assess growth, development,  behavior concerns, neurologic issues, gastrointestinal functioning, and  musculoskeletal manifestations. Annual eye examination with attention to retinal  changes for individuals with HS. Annual audiology evaluation. Dental evaluation  every six months, particularly for individuals with XLOS and LS. Females with HS  should have an annual echocardiogram, carotid ultrasound, gastroenterology  evaluation with liver function testing and consideration of clotting studies, serum  bile acids, and liver ultrasound based on recommendations of a gastroenterologist;  and MRA of the head and neck for aneurysms every two years. GENETIC COUNSELING:  MED12-related disorders are inherited in an X-linked manner. If the mother of a  proband is heterozygous for a pathogenic variant, the chance of transmitting it in  each pregnancy is 50%. Males who inherit the pathogenic variant will be affected.  Females who inherit a pathogenic variant associated with FGS1, LS, or XLOS will  typically be unaffected while females who inherit a pathogenic variant associated  with HS will typically be affected. Females who inherit a MED12 pathogenic variant  associated with NSID will be at an increased risk of developing variable clinical  features. Males with a MED12-related disorder are not known to reproduce. Once the  MED12 pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member,  heterozygote testing for at-risk female relatives and prenatal and preimplantation  genetic testing for MED12-related disorders are possible.",

        "Abstract": "The interactions of phosphatidylcholine (PC) to regions of the myelin basic protein  (MBP) was examined. In solid phase binding assays the nature of the binding of  unilamellar vesicles of 14C-labeled phosphatidylcholine to bovine 18.5 kDa MBP, its  N- and C-terminal peptide fragments, photooxidized 18.5 kDa MBP and the mouse 14 kDa  protein, with an internal deletion of residues 117-157, was studied. The data were  analyzed by computer-generated Scatchard plots in which non-specific binding was  eliminated. Non-cooperative, low affinity binding of PC vesicles to MBP was  observed, and this binding found to be sensitive to pH and ionic changes. At an  ionic strength of 0.1 and pH 7.4, the binding of PC to the 14 kDa mouse MBP  exhibited a Kd similar to that obtained with both the N-terminal and photooxidized  18.5 kDa bovine MBP. The studies indicated that the sites of PC interaction with MBP  are located in the N-terminal region of the protein. The C-terminal region appeared  to modulate the strength of the interaction slightly. Under similar conditions,  lysozyme did not bind PC liposomes, and histone bound them nonspecifically.",

        "Title": "MECP2 Duplication Syndrome.",
        "Abstract": "CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: MECP2 duplication syndrome is a severe neurodevelopmental  disorder characterized by early-onset hypotonia, feeding difficulty,  gastrointestinal manifestations including gastroesophageal reflux and constipation,  delayed psychomotor development leading to severe intellectual disability, poor  speech development, progressive spasticity, recurrent respiratory infections (in  ~75% of affected individuals), and seizures (in ~50%). MECP2 duplication syndrome is  100% penetrant in males. Occasionally females have been described with a MECP2  duplication and a range of findings from mild intellectual disability to a phenotype  similar to that seen in males. In addition to the core features, autistic behaviors,  nonspecific neuroradiologic findings on brain MRI, mottled skin, and urogenital  anomalies have been observed in several affected boys. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The  diagnosis of MECP2 duplication syndrome is established in an individual by  identification of a heterozygous whole-gene duplication of MECP2 on molecular  genetic testing. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Routine management of  feeding difficulties, constipation, developmental and speech delays, spasticity, and  seizures. Physical therapy to maintain range of motion to reduce likelihood of  contractures. Prompt antibiotic treatment for respiratory infections; all vaccines  should be given; consider gastrotomy tube if aspiration is present. Social work and  care coordination as indicated. Surveillance: Routine monitoring for growth, feeding  issues, constipation, reflux, loss of speech, progressive spasticity, seizure  disorder and response to anti-seizure medication, infections, and autistic-like  features. GENETIC COUNSELING: MECP2 duplication syndrome is inherited in an X-linked  manner. The majority of affected males have inherited the MECP2 duplication from a  heterozygous mother; however, de novo genetic alterations have been reported. If the  mother of the proband has a MECP2 duplication, the chance of transmitting it in each  pregnancy is 50%. Males who inherit the MECP2 duplication will be affected; females  who inherit the MECP2 duplication are typically asymptomatic but may exhibit  clinical manifestations ranging from mild nonspecific intellectual disability to a  severe phenotype similar to that observed in males. If the mother of the proband has  a balanced structural chromosome rearrangement involving the Xq28 region, the risk  to sibs depends on the specific chromosome rearrangement. Once the MECP2 duplication  has been identified in an affected family member (and/or the mother of the proband  is found to be a carrier of a balanced translocation), prenatal testing for a  pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

In all trisomies, changes of phosphatase activity in the  cerebellar structures were demonstrated which were particularly marked with alkaline  phosphatase. The activity of this enzyme increased not only in the vascular  endothelium but in a number of cellular structures as well: in the external  embryonal and internal granular layers of the cortex, in the nuclei of Purkinje  cells and neurons of the nucleus dentatus, in the foci of heterotopia of cortical  cells into the white matter and nucleus dentatus. In Edwards' syndrome the activity  of alkaline phosphatase in cellular elements of the cerebellum was slightly higher  than in the control group. Changes in the activity was observed in the cells of the  external embryonal layer, neurons of the nucleus dentatus and in the cells of the  heterotopic foci. In autosomal trisomies dystopic cells have dissimilar levels of  phosphatase activity and stain mosaically which seems to confirm the assumption of  their dissimilar differentiation.",

Several studies have  linked the loss of MeCP2 function to alterations of brain-derived neurotrophic  factor (BDNF) levels, but non-specific overexpression of BDNF only partially  improves the phenotype of Mecp2-deficient mice. We and others have previously shown  that huntingtin (HTT) scaffolds molecular motor complexes, transports  BDNF-containing vesicles, and is under-expressed in Mecp2 knockout brains. Here, we  demonstrate that promoting HTT phosphorylation at Ser421, either by a  phospho-mimetic mutation or inhibition of the phosphatase calcineurin, restores  endogenous BDNF axonal transport in\u00a0vitro in the corticostriatal pathway, increases  striatal BDNF availability and synaptic connectivity in\u00a0vivo, and improves the  phenotype and the survival of Mecp2 knockout mice-even though treatments were  initiated only after the mice had already developed symptoms. Stimulation of  endogenous cellular pathways may thus be a promising approach for the treatment of  RTT patients.",

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a rare congenital lipid-storage  disorder, leading to a progressive multisystem disease. CTX with autosomal recessive  inheritance is caused by a defect in the CYP27A1 gene. Chronic diarrhea, tendon  xanthomas, neurologic impairment, and bilateral cataracts are common symptoms of the  disease. METHODS: Three affected siblings with an initial diagnosis of non-syndromic  intellectual disability were recruited for further molecular investigations. To  identify the possible genetic cause(s), whole exome sequencing was performed on the  proband. Sanger sequencing was applied to confirm the final variant. The clinical  and molecular genetic features of the three siblings from the new CTX family and  other patients with the same mutations, as previously reported, were analyzed. The  CYP27A1 gene was also studied for the number of pathogenic variants and their  location. RESULTS: We found a homozygous splicing mutation, NM_000784: exon6:  c.1184+1G>A, in CYP27A1 gene, which was confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Among the  detected pathogenic variants, the splice site mutation had the highest prevalence,  and the mutations were mostly found in exon 4. CONCLUSION: This study is the first  to report the c.1184+1G>A mutation in Iran. Our findings highlight the other feature  of the disease, which is the lack of relationship between phenotype and genotype.  Due to nonspecific symptoms and delay in diagnosis, CYP27A1 genetic analysis should  be the definitive method for CTX diagnosis.",

        "Abstract": "We describe the case of a seven-year-old female patient who presented in our service  with severe developmental delay, intellectual disability, facial dysmorphism, and  femur fracture, observed in the context of very low bone mineral density.  Array-based single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP array) analysis identified a 113 kb  duplication involving the morbid OMIM genes: ANKRD11 (exon1), RPL13, and PGN genes.  ANKRD11 deletions are frequently described in association with KBG syndrome, the  duplications being less frequent (one case described before). The exome sequencing  was negative for pathogenic variants or of uncertain significance in genes possibly  associated with this phenotype. The patient presented subtle signs of KBG syndrome.  It is known that the phenotype of KBG syndrome has a wide clinical spectrum, this  syndrome being often underdiagnosed due to overlapping features with other  conditions, also characterized by multiple congenital anomalies and intellectual  disability. The particularity of this case is represented by the very low bone  mineral density in a patient with 16q24.3 duplication. ANKRD11 haploinsufficiency is  known to be associated with skeletal involvement, such as short stature, or delayed  bone age. An effect on bone density has been observed only in experimental studies  on mice with induced missense mutations in the ANKRD11 gene. This CNV also involved  the duplication of the very conserved RPL13 gene, which could have a role for the  skeletal phenotype of this patient, knowing the high level of gene expression in  bone tissue and also the association with spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia Isidor  Toutain type, in case of splicing mutations.",

        "Abstract": "We have investigated the properties of mutant forms of the methyl-CpG binding  transcriptional repressor MeCP2 associated with Rett syndrome, a childhood  neurodevelopmental disorder. We find that four Rett syndrome mutations at known  sites within the methyl-CpG binding domain (MBD) impair binding to methylated DNA,  but have little effect on nonspecific interactions with unmethylated DNA. Three of  these mutations (R106W, R133C, and F155S) have their binding affinities for  methylated DNA reduced more than 100-fold; this is consistent with the hypothesis  that impaired selectivity for methylated DNA of mutant MeCP2 contributes to Rett  syndrome. However, a fourth mutant, T158M, has its binding affinity for methylated  DNA reduced only 2-fold, indicative either of additional distinct regulatory  functions associated with the MBD or of an exquisite sensitivity of developing  neurons to the selective association of MeCP2 with methylated DNA.",

Children were randomly assigned by matched  pairs to either a vitamin/mineral group or placebo group for an 8-month study  period. No significant group differences or suggestive trends were found in any  tested area of development or behavior, including intelligence (IQ), school  achievement, speech and language, and neuromotor function. No group differences in  appearance, growth, or health were seen. No support was found for the orthomolecular  hypothesis in school-aged children with Down's syndrome.",

        "Abstract": "The fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), the functional absence of which  causes fragile X syndrome, is an RNA-binding protein that has been implicated in the  regulation of local protein synthesis at the synapse. The mechanism of FMRP's  interaction with its target mRNAs, however, has remained controversial. In one  model, it has been proposed that BC1 RNA, a small non-protein-coding RNA that  localizes to synaptodendritic domains, operates as a requisite adaptor by  specifically binding to both FMRP and, via direct base-pairing, to FMRP target  mRNAs. Other models posit that FMRP interacts with its target mRNAs directly, i.e.,  in a BC1-independent manner. Here five laboratories independently set out to test  the BC1-FMRP model. We report that specific BC1-FMRP interactions could be  documented neither in vitro nor in vivo. Interactions between BC1 RNA and FMRP  target mRNAs were determined to be of a nonspecific nature. Significantly, the  association of FMRP with bona fide target mRNAs was independent of the presence of  BC1 RNA in vivo. The combined experimental evidence is discordant with a proposed  scenario in which BC1 RNA acts as a bridge between FMRP and its target mRNAs and  rather supports a model in which BC1 RNA and FMRP are translational repressors that  operate independently.",

        "Abstract": "We report on a 6-year-old boy referred for cytogenetics study. A few non-specific  features were observed in the newborn: hypotonia, failure to thrive, seizures,  pre-auricular skin tags. Cat-like cry was not identified. No remarkable facial  dysmorphism, gastrointestinal, respiratory or cardiac abnormalities were identified.  At age 4 years, speech and motor skill delays were apparent. Karyotyping and FISH  analysis revealed a de novo rearranged chromosome 5p, with subtelomeric deletion of  5p and a duplication of the cri-du-chat critical region. Array CGH using  sub-megabase resolution tiling-set (SMRT) array followed by FISH analysis with  labeled BACs showed a deletion of 5pter to 5p15.31 (0-6.9 Mb) and an inverted  duplication of the greater part of 5p15.31 to the distal end of 5p14.3 (6.9-19.9  Mb). Although very rare, inverted duplications with terminal deletion (inv dup del)  have been reported at different chromosomal ends. Our finding adds a second patient  of inv dup del 5p to this growing list, and the potential causative mechanisms for  this rearrangement are discussed. Review of the mapping information of cri-du-chat  patients and the comparison with a previously reported patient suggested that the  critical region for cat-like cry is located within a 0.6 Mb region.",

When the accumulated hair extends  into the small intestine, it causes a rare disturbance called Rapunzel syndrome  (RS). DISCUSSION: Affected patients infrequently remain asymptomatic for several  years. Symptoms begin while the bezoar increases in size to the point of  obstruction, these symptoms are nonspecific like vomiting, nausea, anorexia,  asymptomatic abdominal mass and digestive bleeding. PRESENTATION OF CASE: The  authors report an unusual case of a 25 years old young woman who presented with  acute abdominal pain and gastrointestinal symptoms. With an upper gastroscopy, the  condition was first diagnosed as a Trichobezoar that occupied the stomach. A  decision to perform a surgical procedure was taken, only to discover, during the  procedure, that the mass was extended to the duodenum and jejunum, thus diagnosing  the condition as Rapunzel syndrome. The patient was managed by surgical removal of  the huge mass. CONCLUSION: Trichobezoar considers as a differential diagnosis for  any patient with mental retardation and has gastrointestinal symptoms.",

Indirect  immunofluorescence staining revealed that catalase was mainly detected in the  cytosol of fibroblasts from these patients, but a small amount of catalase was  detected in granular pattern in a small percentage of cells. Double  immunofluorescence staining revealed that catalase-containing particles in these  patients also contained acyl-CoA oxidase and nonspecific lipid transfer protein.  However, a 70 kD integral membrane protein and 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase were detected  in all cells in granular pattern. Subcellular fractionation using digitonin after  cell labeling revealed that a small amount of acyl-CoA oxidase and about half of  thiolase in the precursor form were detected in the particulate fraction. These data  suggest that the mechanisms of the transport and processing of catalase, acyl-CoA  oxidase and nonspecific lipid transfer protein are different from those of the 70 kD  integral membrane protein and 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase.",

        "Title": "Eye and ocular adnexa manifestations of MED12-related disorders.",
        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: MED12-related disorders are a rare group of intellectual disability  syndromes with a broad range of phenotypic characteristics. The phenotypic spectrum  of MED12-related disorders currently includes X-Linked Ohdo Syndrome, Lujan-Fryns  Syndrome (LS), and FG syndrome type 1 (FG), also known as Opitz-Kaveggia Syndrome.  The MED12 gene encodes the largest component of the mediator complex of RNA  polymerase II, which is critical for recruiting activators and repressors to  regulate the transcription of genes critical to growth, development, and  differentiation. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature review of previously  published cases to highlight the key ocular features in individuals with  MED12-related disorders. In addition, we present a new case of a female patient with  a de novo pathogenic c. 3866A>G, p.Q1289R variant. Ocular manifestations are not  uncommon in MED12-related disorders, but have not been characterized in literature  reports. Commonly reoccurring reported eye and ocular adnexa features within the  spectrum include ptosis, downslanting palpebral fissures, and hypertelorism. Other  less common findings include strabismus, astigmatism, and optic nerve hypoplasia.  RESULTS: Our patient presented with developmental delay, mild hypotonia and  dysmorphic features including frontal bossing, high arched palate, and syndactyly of  the 2(nd) and 3(rd) toes bilaterally. DISCUSSION: Ocular manifestations identified  in this patient included intermittent esotropia, hyperopic astigmatism, epicanthal  folds and ptosis bilaterally.",

        "Abstract": "Neutrophil alkaline phosphatase (NAP) was analysed in 25 pregnant women with trisomy  21 foetuses whose chromosomal aberration was recognized by cytogenetic study after  amniocentesis. Enzyme investigation was performed at 20-22 weeks of gestation using  cytochemical and biochemical techniques. Twenty-nine women at the same stage of  normal pregnancies were selected as controls. In parallel, each mother was  karyotyped. Ten subjects from each series underwent biochemical and immunological  investigation: measurement of enzyme levels, thermostability study and immunological  tests with alkaline phosphatase isoenzyme antibodies. NAP from pregnant women with  trisomy 21 foetuses was characterized by: (1) a lower rate of enzyme activity, (2) a  large amount of heat-stable enzyme (T = 56 degrees C for biochemical assays, T = 85  degrees C for cytochemical tests), and (3) a marked loss of liver antigenicity.  These findings suggest the presence in trisomy 21 pregnancies of a non-specific  alkaline phosphatase isoenzyme which appears as an \"enzyme marker\" in maternal  circulating neutrophils.",

        "Abstract": "The prevalence of antibodies to hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV) was measured in a  number of groups known to be at increased risk of blood-borne viral infections,  using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (EIA) based on a nonstructural peptide  generated by recombinant DNA technology. The assay was repeatably reactive in 75.6%  of men with haemophilia, 61.9% of intravenous drug users, 34.1% of homosexual men  who were regular attenders at a gay sauna and 30.8% of prisoners. A lower reactivity  was detected in sera collected from female prostitutes (10.4%), patients undergoing  maintenance haemodialysis (5.9%), or renal transplantation (6.9%) and patients  attending a sexually transmitted diseases clinic (6.2%). We also measured reactivity  among inmates of a large institution for the mentally handicapped in which hepatitis  B is known to be endemic, and in panels of sera which had been stored for 25-35  years. The test was positive in 41.1% of mentally handicapped patients with Down's  syndrome and 7% of subjects with other forms of mental retardation. Similarly some  23% and 20% of sera collected in 1954 and 1964 from patients with a variety of  illnesses were found to be reactive. As most diagnostic assays suffer from some  degree of non-specificity and confirmatory tests for the anti-HCV assay were not  initially available in Australia, we analysed the distribution of optical density  (OD) values in the different groups, in an attempt to obtain an insight into the  specificity of the results being obtained. Whereas the ODs of sera collected from  patients with haemophilia and IVDU had a bimodal pattern, with two well separated  sets of results on either side of the cut-off.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Of the incidences, no proband with true complete tetrasomy 21 has  survived the neonatal period. We report complete mosaic tetrasomy 21 in a female  infant with the typical Down syndrome phenotype, including Hirschsprung's disease  and atrioventricular (AV) canal defect. This is in contrast to cases of partial  tetrasomy 21, which often have an atypical trisomy 21 presentation and multiple  nonspecific traits, including short stature, microcephaly, and developmental delays.  This case demonstrates the difference in clinical presentation between the partial  and complete subtype of tetrasomy 21 and provides the first postnatal clinical  picture of an infant with true mosaic complete tetrasomy 21.",

One aim of this study was  to investigate the Simple View of Reading as a theoretical framework to describe  cognitive and linguistic abilities predicting individual differences in reading  comprehension in adolescents with non-specific ID. A second aim was to investigate  whether predictors of listening comprehension and reading comprehension suggest that  individuals with ID have a delayed pattern of development (copying early grade  variance in reading comprehension) or a different pattern of development involving a  new or an unusual pattern of cognitive and linguistic predictors. A sample of 136  adolescents with non-specific ID was assessed on reading comprehension, decoding,  linguistic, and cognitive measures. The hypotheses were evaluated using structural  equation models. The results showed that the Simple View of Reading was not  applicable in explaining reading comprehension in this group, however, the  concurrent predictors of comprehension (vocabulary and phonological executive-loaded  working memory) followed a delayed profile.",

        "Title": "Mosaic variegated aneuploidy without microcephaly: implications for cytogenetic  diagnosis.",
        "Abstract": "Mosaic variegated aneuploidy (MVA) is a rare condition characterized by multiple  trisomies, rarely monosomies, and a non-specific phenotype including microcephaly,  growth and mental retardation, mild malformations, and an increased risk of  malignancy. We describe a patient with MVA in whom trisomy 19 mosaicism was  originally suspected. The patient was the product of an uncomplicated term pregnancy  and delivery. Significant findings were mental retardation, obesity, mild epicanthal  folds, tapering fingers, relatively small hands and feet, alternating exotropia,  nasal speech limited to short phrases, and generalized hypotonia. There is no family  history for birth defects, mental retardation, or consanguinity. The initial  peripheral blood chromosome study showed trisomy 19 in 4 of 31 metaphase cells.  Because mosaic trisomy 19 is rare, the study was extended to 100 cells, wherein two  cells with trisomy 8 were identified. A second blood karyotype was obtained and  found to be 47,XX,+8[3]/47,XX,+19[3]/47,XX, +18[2]/47,XX,+9[1]/46,XX[91]. Skin  fibroblast chromosome studies revealed a 46,XX karyotype in 120 cells examined.  There was no evidence of premature centromere separation. Mutations in the BUB1B  gene that encodes a key mitotic spindle checkpoint protein have been described in  MVA; however, no mutations of this gene were identified in our patient. This case  illustrates the importance of considering other possibilities when confronted with  an extremely rare diagnosis such as mosaic trisomy 19. In addition, it shows the  importance of not simply interpreting a low percentage of multiple aneuploidies as  cell culture artifact, because an additional work-up to rule out MVA may be  warranted since this diagnosis is associated with an increased risk of malignancy.",

        "Abstract": "In idiopathic or nonspecific mental retardation, the overall rate of cryptic  subtelomeric rearrangements is estimated to be about 5%. Development of  cost-effective screening for subtelomeric deletions would help clinical geneticists  to make specific diagnoses in children with idiopathic mental retardation. Current  screening modalities include fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using  subtelomeric probes and PCR-based quantitative analyses. Reductions in the cost and  turnaround time will make the complete screening of subtelomeric rearrangements more  widely used in clinical settings. Recently, a versatile method, called the multiplex  PCR/liquid chromatography assay (MP/LC), was developed to assess copy numbers in  this assay. Multiple genomic regions are amplified using unlabeled primers, then  separated by ion-pair reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. In the  present study, we developed an MP/LC-based subtelomeric screening system that  involves 21 multiple reactions and validated the protocol by analyzing 16 publicly  available cell lines with known cytogenetic abnormalities involving at least one  subtelomere per patient. To confirm the validity of the MP/LC method, we analyzed  these cell lines concurrently with array-based comparative genomic hybridization  (array-CGH), which gives higher resolution than the conventional G-banding  technique. Among those 16 samples, the results from MP/LC and array-CGH agreed with  each other perfectly. In 2 of the 16 samples, MP/LC correctly revealed subtelomeric  duplications that were detected by array-CGH but were undetected by conventional  cytogenetics, demonstrating the sensitivity of the MP/LC assay. This system is  expected to be useful for making specific diagnoses and in genetic counseling for  children with idiopathic mental retardation, a sizable fraction of whom have  subtelomeric rearrangements.",

        "Abstract": "Down syndrome is associated with an increased susceptibility to infections due to a  deficiency of both specific and nonspecific immunity. AIM: The aim of the study was  to analyze the temporal trends, if any, of some variables related to the  immunological status of children affected by Down syndrome. METHODS: Heparinized  blood samples were obtained by venipuncture in 30 children with Down syndrome, who  were regularly followed in our department and analyzed for hematologic values,  lymphocyte subpopulations, immunoglobulin dosage and zinc level. Results were  compared with those of the normal population. RESULTS: In the first 5 years of life,  we observed a progressive decrease in the medium values of lymphocytes, CD4(+) and  plasma zinc levels, and an increase in CD8(+), immunoglobulin A, immunoglobulin G,  immunoglobulin M and natural killer, but generally without exceeding the interval of  normality. CONCLUSIONS: In Down syndrome children, the immune cellular status is  similar to the normal population as far as white blood cell, lymphocyte, CD4(+),  CD8(+), natural killer and immunoglobulins are concerned. Plasma level of zinc is  normal from birth until 5 years but with a temporal trend of progressive reduction.  This observation supports the hypothesis that a pharmacological supplementation may  be necessary in Down syndrome children only after 5 years of age.",

        "Abstract": "Twenty patients: seven with herpes simplex virus encephalitis (HSVE), six with other  severe central nervous system (CNS) infections and 7 with Rett syndrome were studied  to determine whether they showed any intrathecal synthesis of virus-specific or  total IgG in CNS. The study of the postinfectious patients was made a mean of 20  years after the primary infection in childhood. Four of seven patients with HSVE had  an elevated IgG index and four showed intrathecal viral antibody production which  was both specific (against HSV) and non-specific. One patient with congenital  syphilis and one with tuberculotic meningitis showed non-specific intrathecal viral  antibody synthesis. In three of seven patients with Rett syndrome intrathecal  antibody production was observed. The clarification of the mechanism of polyclonal  immunoactivation in postinfectious diseases would be of interest since similar  persistent immunoactivation is a common feature in multiple sclerosis. In Rett  syndrome the immunoactivation may also have pathogenetic significance.",

        "Abstract": "Nuclear DNA of higher eukaryotes is organized in supercoiled loops anchored to a  proteinaceous substructure commonly known as the nuclear matrix. Current evidence  suggests that important processes of nuclear physiology, such as replication,  transcription, and processing of primary transcripts, take place at macromolecular  complexes located at discrete, well-defined sites upon the nuclear matrix. A number  of authors have reported that actively transcribed genes are closely associated with  the nuclear matrix. The topological relationship between the gene sequences located  in the DNA loops and the nuclear matrix appears to be very important for appropriate  nuclear physiology. Here, we describe a polymerase chain reaction-based method for  directly mapping any DNA sequence position relative to the nuclear matrix that  avoids the problem posed by DNA fragments nonspecifically bound to the nuclear  matrix, without the need of purifying the specifically nuclear matrix-bound DNA.",

        "Abstract": "TCF4 gene (18q21.1) encodes for a transcription factor with multiple isoforms  playing a critical role during neurodevelopment. Molecular alterations of this gene  are associated with Pitt-Hopkins syndrome, a severe condition characterized by  intellectual disability, specific facial features and autonomic nervous system  dysfunction. We report here three patients presenting with structural variations of  the proximal part of TCF4 associated with a mild phenotype. The first patient is a  six-years-old girl carrier of a pericentric inversion of chromosome 18,  46,XX,inv(18)(p11.2q21.1). Whole genome sequencing (WGS) characterized the  breakpoint at the base-pair level at chr18:1262334_1262336 and  chr18:53254747_53254751 (hg19). This latter breakpoint disrupted the proximal  promotor region of TCF4 in the first intron of the gene. The second and third  patients are a son and his mother, carrier of a 46\u202fkb deletion characterized by  high-resolution chromosomal micro-array and WGS (chr:18:53243454_53287927, hg19)  encompassing the first three exon of TCF4 gene and including the proximal promotor  region. Expression studies on blood lymphocytes in these patients showed a marked  decrease of mRNA level for long isoforms of TCF4 and an increased level for shorter  isoforms. The patients described here, together with previously reported patients  with proximal structural alterations of TCF4, help to delineate a phenotype of mild  ID with non-specific facial dysmorphism without characteristic features of PTHS. It  also suggests a gradient of phenotypic severity inversely correlated with the number  of intact TCF4 promotor regions, with expression of short isoforms compensating in  part the loss of longer isoforms.",

        "Abstract": "The authors report the evolution since birth of a third patient belonging to a  sibship affected by the infantile form of Hallervorden-Spatz disease. The diagnosis  has been histologically proven in each case. Due to a lack of full clinical reports  in the available literature, the emphasis has mainly been placed on the complex  extrapyramidal syndrome characteristic of this disorder and illustrated by our own  cases. We stree here the occurrence of extrapyramidal fits with exceptionally severe  hemiballic movements and torsion spasms. Moreover the clinical signs and their  succession in time are strikingly similar in our three patients. Our main purpose is  to document accurately the early stages of this disorder; they are characterized by  a non-specific spastic diplegia associated with mental retardation. There is a  progressive but incomplete improvement during the following years. Thereafter the  extrapyramidal syndrome appears. It is to early to decide whether all the infantile  cases of Hallervorden-Spatz disease do indeed present a diphasic evoluation because  our third patient is the only one to have been followed up since birth; relevant  data are scarcely available in the other reported cases. On the other hand, it is  correct to state that a spastic diplegia with mental retardation under the age of  two--provided a perinatal anoxic excephalopathy has been ruled out--can lead to a  wide range of conditions from normality to a neurological disorder as severe as the  one reported here.",

As voxel-based morphometry reveals regional volume differences, we applied  this method to 119 subjects with cognitive impairments and familial need for  full-time SE--graded into three levels from specific disorders of cognitive  processes (level 1) to intellectual disability (IQ <70; level 3)--and to 43  age-matched controls attending mainstream education (level 0). Subjects in SE groups  had smaller global brain white matter (WM), cerebrospinal fluid, and total brain  volume than controls. Compared with controls, subjects with intellectual  disabilities in SE level 3 showed greater regional gray matter volumes bilaterally  in the ventral and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and smaller regional gray matter  volumes in the left thalamus and cerebellar hemisphere. Further, they had greater WM  volume in the left frontoparietal region and smaller WM volumes in the posterior  limbs of the internal capsules. Subjects in SE level 1 and 2 groups showed the same  tendency, but the results were nonsignificant. In conclusion, compared with  controls, subjects with intellectual disabilities showed in voxel-based morphometry  analysis several regional brain alterations.",

Blood from 15 healthy controls closely  matched for age and sex was also assayed. The mean blastogenic value in PHA  stimulated patient lymphocyte cultures was similar to that calculated in the  controls. In contrast, the mitogenic response of lymphocytes from patients with  Down's syndrome to anti-CD3 stimulation was on average significantly reduced.  Immunofluorescence studies and additional experiments carried out by using  semiallogeneic (maternal) monocytes as a source of antigen presenting cells showed  that the impaired anti-CD3 induced mitogenesis in Down's syndrome could not be  ascribed either to a lack of binding of the antibody to the trisomic cells, or to a  defective monocyte-T cell interaction. These findings help to explain the cellular  basis of the immune defect in Down's syndrome.",

        "Abstract": "3q29 deletion syndrome is a rare disorder, causing a complex phenotype. Clinical  features are variable and relatively non-specific. Our report aims to present an  atypical, de novo deletion in chromosome band 3q29 in a preschool boy, first child  of healthy non-consanguineous parents, presenting a particular phenotype  (microcephaly, \"full moon\" face, flattened facial profile, large ears, auricular  polyp, and dental dystrophies), motor and cognitive delay, characteristics of autism  spectrum disorder and aggressive behavior. He also presented intrauterine growth  restriction (birth weight 2,400 g) and a ventricular septal defect. SNP Array  revealed a 962 kb copy number loss, on the chromosome 3q29 band  (195519857-196482211), consistent with 3q29 microdeletion syndrome. FISH analysis  using a RP11-252K11 probe confirmed the deletion in the proband, which was not  present in the parents. Although the patient's deletion is relatively small, it  partly overlaps the canonical 3q29 deletion (defined between TFRC and DLG1 gene) and  extends upstream, associating a different facial phenotype compared to the classic  3q29 deletion, nonetheless showing a similar psychiatric disorder. This deletion is  different from the canonical region, as it does not include the PAK2 and DLG1 genes,  considered as candidates for causing intellectual disability. Thus, narrowing the  genotype-phenotype correlation for the 3q29 band, FBX045 is suggested as a candidate  gene for the neuropsychiatric phenotype.",

The authors report on a 3-year-old girl with  global developmental delay harboring a de novo 1.24 Mb distal chromosome 22q11.2  microduplication and a paternally inherited 0.25 Mb chromosome 4p14  microduplication. The authors review clinical features of 30 reported cases of  distal 22q11.2 duplications. Common features include developmental delay (93%),  neuropsychiatric features (26%), and nonspecific facial dysmorphisms (74%). In 70%  of cases, the distal 22q11.2 duplications were inherited, and the majority of the  carrier parents were phenotypically normal. Furthermore, 30% of probands carried an  additional copy number variant. Review of the phenotype in individuals carrying  microduplications involving similar low copy repeats (LCR) failed to establish any  clear genotype-phenotype correlations. Distal 22q11.2 duplications represent a major  challenge for genetic counseling and prediction of clinical consequences. Our report  suggests a pathogenic role of distal 22q11.2 duplications and supports a \"multiple  hit\" hypothesis underlying its variable expressivity and phenotypic severity.",

In this study we have evaluated the effects of  the new synthetic immunomodulator pidotimod in recurrent infections of the upper  respiratory tract in a group of children with DS. It was an open trial vs untreated  control, the pidotimod-treated group consisted of 14 subjects and the control group  of 12. Pidotimod was administered at the dose of one 400 mg oral bottle/day for 90  days. There was a significant reduction in the frequency, severity and duration of  infectious episodes in the pidotimod-treated group vs the untreated control group.  The beneficial effects of pidotimod were also confirmed by a series of recordings  made over the 90-day treatment period which showed a significant reduction in the  number of days of fever, severity of the signs and symptoms of the acute episodes  and use of antibiotics and antipyretic drugs. Pidotimod was well tolerated and no  clinical, hematological or biochemical side-effects were noted.",

        "Title": "Diet, genetics, and mental retardation interaction between phenylketonuric  heterozygous mother and fetus to produce nonspecific diminution of IQ: evidence in  support of the justification hypothesis.",
        "Abstract": "The justification hypothesis postulates that an individual genetically deficient in  the synthesis of any of the 12 nonessential amino acids requires that amino acid in  the diet just as a normal individual requires any essential amino acid. The  deficiency of that single amino acid causes diminished protein synthesis. The  hypothesis proposes that mental retardation develops during the late stage of fetal  development, when the brain is growing most rapidly, as a result of the inability of  the mother to deliver an appropriate amount of that nonessential amino acid to her  fetus who, in turn, is unable to correct for this deficiency due to his genetic  constitution. A paradigm is provided by the disease phenylketonuria in which the  homozygote lacks the enzyme for synthesis of the nonessential amino acid tyrosine.  By measuring the appearance of tyrosine in the plasma after an oral dose of  phenylalanine, it is possible to show differential capability among siblings of  known phenylketonuric children, in the expected Mendelian ratio. The mean IQ of the  two-thirds of the siblings who were least able to convert phenylalanine to tyrosine  (presumably heterozygotes) was 10 points lower than the mean IQ of the \"normals,\"  who were most able to synthesize tyrosine. The difference is statistically  significant (P <0.01). The mean maternal IQ was halfway between that of the  heterozygote group and that of the normal group, confirming the prediction of  maternal-fetal interaction.",

        "Title": "Diagnosis and long-term course of Dravet syndrome.",
        "Abstract": "Dravet syndrome is a severe infantile-onset epilepsy syndrome with a distinctive but  complex electroclinical presentation. A healthy, developmentally normal infant  presents at around 6 months of age with convulsive status epilepticus, which may be  hemiclonic or generalized; seizures may be triggered by fever, illness or  vaccination. The infant typically has further episodes of status epilepticus every  month or two, often triggered by fever. Other seizure types including focal  dyscognitive seizures, absence and myoclonic seizures develop between 1 and 4 years.  Atonic drop attacks and episodes of non-convulsive status may occur. Early  development is normal but slows in the second year. Developmental regression may  occur, particularly with status epilepticus. EEG studies are initially normal, but  after 2 years they show generalized spike-wave and polyspike-wave activity with  multifocal discharges. Photosensitivity may be seen. Imaging is normal or shows  non-specific findings such as atrophy. Dravet syndrome is associated with mutations  of the gene encoding the alpha-1 subunit of the sodium channel, SCN1A, in >70% of  patients. These include sequencing mutations and copy number variant anomalies; 90%  of mutations arise de novo. PCDH19 mutational analysis is a second-tier test for  girls with a Dravet-like picture who do not have SCN1A mutations. Outcome is poor,  with intellectual disability in most patients and ongoing seizures. Intellectual  impairment varies from severe in 50% patients, to moderate and mild intellectual  disability each accounting for 25% cases. Rare patients have normal intellect. The  long-term course involves ongoing, brief nocturnal convulsions and a characteristic  deterioration in gait.",

        "Abstract": "Angelman syndrome (AS) is characterized by severe intellectual disability, limited,  or absent speech and a generally happy demeanor. The four known etiological  mechanisms; deletions, uniparental disomy, imprinting defects, and UBE3A mutation  all affect expression of the UBE3A gene at 15q11-q13. An atypical phenotype is seen  in individuals who are mosaic for a chromosome 15q11-q13 imprinting defect on the  maternal allele. These patients present with a milder phenotype, often with  hyperphagia and obesity or non-specific intellectual disability. Unlike typical AS  syndrome, they can have a vocabulary up to 100 words and speak in sentences. Ataxia  and seizures may not be present, and the majority of individuals do not have  microcephaly. Here we review the current literature and present three individuals  with atypical AS caused by a mosaic imprinting defect to demonstrate why DNA  methylation analysis at the SNRPN locus needs to be considered in a broader clinical  context. \u00a9 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

        "Abstract": "In genetic endocrine diseases, genetic testing is necessary for a precise diagnosis,  which will provide a better knowledge of the evolution and prognosis and also  indicate the adequate therapy, targeting the precise etiopathogenesis of the  disease. Genetic testing in endocrinology is often based on classical cytogenetic  techniques, molecular cytogenetic analysis or molecular biology techniques. Genetic  testing in disorders of sex development includes the karyotype and SRY gene analysis  and depending on the presence of associated clinical signs and on the observations  at paraclinical examination, these tests will be followed by chromosomal array  techniques and NGS sequencing. In short stature, the decision to perform a genetic  test is taken depending on clinical, paraclinical and imaging signs. In case of a  short stature associated with a low weight/length for gestational age, genetic  testing is proposed to evaluate a Russell-Silver syndrome or if the short stature is  associated with other clinical signs (e.g. intellectual disability), chromosomal  analysis by microarray is proposed. If the short stature is disproportionate, it is  indicated to perform a next generation sequencing (NGS) of a panel of genes involved  in skeletal dysplasia. If an endocrine cause for short stature is observed at the  hormonal evaluation, it is indicated to test a panel of genes involved in these  pathways. In genetic obesity, depending on clinical signs associated to obesity, it  will be a more targeted genetic testing. If obesity is associated with intellectual  disability or other nonspecific neurological changes, a chromosomal analysis by  microarray will be indicated. If monogenic obesity is suspected, NGS testing will be  indicated (as genes panel or whole exome or genome analysis). Genetic testing in  endocrine diseases brings an etiological diagnosis, but a favorable cost-benefit  ratio derives from an adequate indication of these tests, generally proposed in  expert centers for rare endocrine diseases.",

        "Abstract": "Neurological dysfunction is a prominent feature of most peroxisomal disorders.  Enormous progress in defining their gene defects has been achieved. The genes and  gene products, peroxins (PEX), in five of the complementation groups have been  defined. These studies confirm that Zellweger syndrome (ZS), neonatal  adrenoleukodystrophy (NALD), and infantile Refsum disease (IRD) are a disease  continuum. The gene defect in adreno-leukodystrophy (ALD) / adrenomyeloneuropathy  (AMN) involves an integral peroxisomal membrane protein. Neuropathologic lesions are  of three major classes: (i) abnormalities in neuronal migration or differentiation,  (ii) defects in the formation or maintenance of central white matter, and (iii)  postdevelopmental neuronal degenerations. The central white matter lesions are those  of: (i) inflammatory demyelination, (ii) non-inflammatory dysmyelination, and (iii)  non-specific reductions in myelin volume or staining with or without reactive  astrocytosis. The neuronal degenerations are of two major types: (i) the axonopathy  of AMN involving ascending and descending tracts of the spinal cord, and (ii)  cerebellar atrophy in rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata and probably IRD. We  postulate that the abnormal fatty acids in peroxisomal disorders, particularly very  long chain fatty acids and phytanic acid, are incorporated into cell membranes and  perturb their microenvironments resulting in dysfunction, atrophy and death of  vulnerable cells. The advent of mouse models for ZS and ALD is anticipated to  provide even greater pathogenetic insights into the peroxisomal disorders.",

Two children in one family presented with progressive myoclonic epilepsy  syndrome, and two children in the other family presented with ataxochoreo-athetoid  symptoms. Early-onset childhood dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy involved mental  retardation, whereas myoclonic epilepsy was the predominant complaint in later-onset  childhood version of the disease. Aspiration pneumonia was common in the late stage  of disease. Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy is an autosomal dominant condition  attributed to CAG trinucleotide repeats in the dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy  gene. The four children in this series had 63 to 79 CAG repeats. The expanded allele  was inherited from the father in both families. One father had 54 CAG repeats and  was asymptomatic; the other had 66 repeats and had an unsteady gait. Because the  radiological, electroencephalographic, and electrophysiological findings were  non-specific, we suggest that DRPLA gene testing should be performed in any child  presenting with a variable combination of myoclonic epilepsy, mental retardation or  developmental regression, and ataxochoreo-athetosis.",

        "Abstract": "It is now known that 15 monogenic, mostly neurological, disorders are caused by the  same type of mutations that occur in trinucleotide repeat sequences in certain  genes. Since they share a nonspecific and variable phenotype, the accurate diagnosis  could be made only by DNA analysis. We developed an Expand Long PCR assay that  provides more reliable molecular diagnosis of such disorders. Its main  characteristics are robust amplification of expanded alleles, simplicity, low cost  and speed. We suggest the use of Expand Long PCR for routine molecular diagnosis of  triplet repeat diseases, and present such analysis of the fragile X syndrome,  myotonic dystrophy and Huntington's disease.",

        "Abstract": "Although Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are generally assumed to be lifelong, we  review evidence that between 3% and 25% of children reportedly lose their ASD  diagnosis and enter the normal range of cognitive, adaptive and social skills.  Predictors of recovery include relatively high intelligence, receptive language,  verbal and motor imitation, and motor development, but not overall symptom severity.  Earlier age of diagnosis and treatment, and a diagnosis of Pervasive Developmental  Disorder-Not Otherwise Specified are also favorable signs. The presence of seizures,  mental retardation and genetic syndromes are unfavorable signs, whereas head growth  does not predict outcome. Controlled studies that report the most recovery came  about after the use of behavioral techniques. Residual vulnerabilities affect  higher-order communication and attention. Tics, depression and phobias are frequent  residual co-morbidities after recovery. Possible mechanisms of recovery include:  normalizing input by forcing attention outward or enriching the environment;  promoting the reinforcement value of social stimuli; preventing interfering  behaviors; mass practice of weak skills; reducing stress and stabilizing arousal.  Improving nutrition and sleep quality is non-specifically beneficial.",

The aim of the study was to demonstrate the similarity of lesions in a  genetic and a nutritional form of copper deficiency in support of the view that all  lesions in Menkes' disease could be ascribed to simple hypocupraemia. All lesions of  Menkes' disease were shown to have their counterpart in swayback, with exception of  the abnormal arborisations of the Purkinje cell dendrites. These have often been  interpreted as malformations and cited in evidence of the prenatal origin of the  cerebral lesions. They are, however, non-specific and similar lesions have been  reported in conditions arising in later life. While there is abundant collateral  evidence of disturbed copper metabolism in utero, the problem of the prenatal versus  postnatal origin of cerebral damage remains unresolved.",

In these cases with an abnormal phenotype, the duplications were  maternally derived. Paternal origin of the duplication has been associated with a  normal phenotype. We report on a patient who presented with nonspecific  developmental delay and partial agenesis of the rostral corpus callosum.  Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) studies using probes specific for the  PWS/AS region demonstrated a double signal on one chromosome 15, indicating the  presence of an interstitial duplication of proximal 15q involving the PWS/ AS region  in the patient. Parental chromosomes were normal with FISH studies. Methylation  analysis at exon alpha of the SNRPN locus showed a maternal band at 4.2 kb and a  paternal band of apparent double intensity at 0.9 kb, suggestive of one copy of the  maternal allele and two copies of the paternal allele in the patient. Microsatellite  analysis was informative at the GABRB3 locus in the family, which showed the  inheritance of two different paternal alleles and a maternal allele in the patient  consistent with the origin of this duplication from an unequal crossing over between  the two chromosome 15 homologs in the father. This is the first report of an  abnormal phenotype associated with a paternally derived duplication of proximal 15q  shown to contain the PWS/AS region by molecular techniques.",

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Analysis of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHc) activity in human  skin fibroblasts is hampered by low enzyme activity in the cells. The most commonly  used radiochemical method detects the formation of (14)CO(2), an endproduct of the  E1 component of PDHc, from [1-(14)C]pyruvate. METHODS: We report a  spectrophotometric method for the analysis of PDHc activity in fibroblasts based on  detection of NADH formation via a p-iodonitrotetrazolium violet (INT)-coupled  system. We investigated in detail the specific requirements of this assay, such as  cofactor requirements and the effects of suggested stimulatory compounds and  different cell disruption procedures. The reliability of the optimized assay was  studied by investigation of patients previously diagnosed with PDHc deficiency and  by comparison with results from the radiochemical method. RESULTS: Mean (SD) total  PDHc activities were 136 (31) and 58 (21) mU/U of citrate synthase in fibroblast  homogenates from 10 healthy volunteers and 7 PDHc-deficient patients, respectively,  by the spectrophotometric assay. Similar results were obtained in a mitochondrial  fraction. Dithiothreitol (DTT) increased the nonspecific inhibitor-insensitive rate  with less pronounced effect on the specific rate of PDHc activity. Administration of  DTT increased PDHc activity to 193 (3)% of control activity (without DTT), but  decreased the inhibitor-sensitive rate from 99 (0.3)% (without DTT) to 69 (2)% (with  0.3 mmol/L DTT). CONCLUSION: The simple, optimized spectrophotometric assay for PDHc  analysis allows reliable investigation of the enzyme complex in human skin  fibroblasts.",

In Amish, all affected individuals have a homozygous one  nucleotide deletion; c.1110delA. In the Omani kindred, all affected have a  homozygous two nucleotides deletion; c.364_365delTA (p.Met122ValfsTer2). Here we  report the results of homozygosity mapping and whole exome sequencing in two  siblings of a consanguineous Turkish family with mild intellectual disability,  spastic paraplegia, and muscular dystrophy. We identified the same deletion that has  been identified in the Omani kindred, but haplotype analysis suggests a recurrent  event, and not a founder mutation. We summarize current knowledge of Troyer  syndrome, and propose wider use of whole exome sequencing in routine diagnostics.  This applies in particular to nonspecific phenotypes with high heterogeneity, such  as spastic paraplegia, intellectual disability, and muscular dystrophy, since in  such cases the assignment of a definite diagnosis is frequently delayed.",

        "Title": "A study of 63 cases with eyelid myoclonia with or without absences: type of seizure  or an epileptic syndrome?",
        "Abstract": "PURPOSE: Eyelid myoclonia and absences (EMA) induced by eye closure associated with  brief, fast, and generalized paroxysms of polyspikes and waves was considered as an  epileptic syndrome and a type of seizure as well. We analyzed the electroclinical  features and evolution of EMA, and tried to determine if it represents a  well-defined epileptic syndrome or a non-specific condition associated to other  epilepsies. METHODS: Between June 1994 and June 2005, 63 patients who met diagnostic  criteria of EMA were enrolled in the study and have been followed up to the present  time. RESULTS: Two main groups could be identified. The first group was divided into  two subgroups. One subgroup of 28 patients presented EMA associated with infrequent  generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS), and the other 1 of 9 patients presented  early-onset EMA refractory to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), associated or not with  GTCS and mental retardation. Four of them had self-induced seizures. The second  group included 26 patients with EMA associated with GTCS and/or massive myoclonias,  or GTCS induced by intermittent photic stimulation. All these patients had  electroclinical features compatible with idiopathic generalized epilepsies.  CONCLUSION: In the first group, EMA should be considered as a photosensitive  idiopathic epileptic syndrome. A subgroup of early-onset of EMA refractory to AEDs,  associated or not with GTCS and mental retardation should also be considered as a  variant or a distinct photosensitive idiopathic epileptic syndrome. Finally, in the  second group EMA may correspond to a type of seizures in idiopathic generalized  epilepsies.",

        "Abstract": "Congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) constitute an ever-growing group of  genetic diseases affecting the glycosylation of proteins. CDG individuals usually  present with severe multisystem disorders. MAN1B1-CDG is a CDG with nonspecific  clinical symptoms such as intellectual deficiency and developmental delay. Although  up to 40 affected individuals were described so far, its final diagnosis is not  straightforward using common biochemical methods due to the trace-level accumulation  of defective glycan structures. In this study, we present three unreported  MAN1B1-CDG individuals and propose a decision tree to reach diagnosis using a panel  of techniques ranging from exome sequencing to gel electrophoresis and mass  spectrometry. The occurrence of MAN1B1-CDG in patients showing unexplained  intellectual disability and development delay, as well as a particular transferrin  glycosylation profile, can be ascertained notably using matrix assisted laser  desorption/ionization - time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry analysis of  endo-\u03b2-acetylglucosaminidase H-released serum N-glycans. In addition to reporting  new pathogenic variants and additional clinical signs such as hypersialorrhea, we  highlight particular biochemical features of MAN1B1-CDG with potential  glycoprotein-specific glycosylation defects.",

Since psychotic persons may commit horrifying acts, such as enucleation of  an eye or amputation of a body part, identification of high risk patients is  crucial. Stereotypical self-mutilation, such as head banging and biting off of  fingertips, is associated with mental retardation and with the syndromes of  Lesch-Nyhan, deLange, and Tourette. This type of self-mutilation is the focus of  biological research or endorphins and on dopamine receptors. Skin cutting and  burning, the most common type of self-mutilation, is often associated with  personality disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, and multiple personality  disorder. When cutting and burning become established as responses to disturbing  psychological symptoms on environmental events, a specific Axis I impulse disorder  known as Repetitive Self Mutilation may be diagnosed. Patients with this newly  identified syndrome may alternate their direct acts of self-mutilation with eating  disorders and episodic alcoholism.",

This study reviews 176 children who were referred for  treatment. Clumsiness was the most common reason for referral. Not all children  benefited from group treatment, and those who had significant degrees of mental  retardation, or mild spasticity worsening on effort, needed individual handling.  Movement training aims mainly to reduce physical clumsiness, and it is hoped that  certain nonspecific benefits may result. The greatest improvement occurred in the  ability to mix with others. Group counselling of parents, with a social worker as  leader, is considered to have played an essential part in the management of these  children's problems.",

        "Abstract": "Genetic isolates, which provide outstanding opportunities for identification of  susceptibility genes for complex diseases, can be classified as primary (having an  ancient demographic history in a stable environment) or secondary (having a younger  demographic history) Neel [1992: Minority populations: Genetics, demography, and  health, pp. 1-13]. Daghestan contains 26 out of 50 indigenous Caucasus ethnicities  that have been in existence for hundreds of generations in the same highland region.  The ethnic groups are subdivided into numerous primary isolates. The founder effect  and gene drift in these primary isolates may have caused aggregation of specific  haplotypes with limited numbers of pathogenic alleles and loci in some isolates  relative to others. These are expressed as inter-population differences in lifetime  prevalence and features of certain complex clinical phenotypes and in patterns of  genetic linkage and linkage disequilibrium (LD). Stable highland and ethnic-cultural  environments have led to increased penetrance and a reduced number of phenocopies,  which typically hamper the identification of any susceptibility genes for complex  diseases. Owing to these characteristics of the primary isolates, a comparative  linkage study in the primary isolates allows us to define the number of  susceptibility genes for any complex disease and to identify the source of  variability and non-replication of linkage analysis results. As part of an ongoing  study, seven extended schizophrenia and one nonspecific mental retardation kindreds  have been ascertained from Daghestan isolates. Lifetime morbid risk for  schizophrenia in the isolates varied from 0 to 5%. A genome scan with markers spaced  10 cM apart was carried out on these pedigrees and linkage analysis was performed  using descent graph methods, as implemented in Simwalk2. To identify regions  containing susceptibility genes within these kindreds, we followed up those regions  with non-parametric and parametric linkage analyses, with the choice of genetic  model guided by the results obtained in the NPL. While the analyses are ongoing, the  most positive findings were made in different isolated pedigrees on chromosomes  17p11, 3q24, and 22q for schizophrenia and on chromosome 12q for nonspecific mental  retardation.",

        "Title": "Presynaptic dopaminergic deficits in Lesch-Nyhan disease.",
        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Lesch-Nyhan disease is a rare, devastating, X-linked recessive disorder  of purine synthesis. Patients present with hyperuricemia, choreoathetosis, dystonia,  and aggressive and self-injurious behavior. Although the genetic and biochemical  abnormalities have been identified, the causes of the neuropsychiatric syndrome  remain unclear. METHODS: We used positron-emission tomography to measure presynaptic  accumulation of fluorodopa F 18 tracer in the dopaminergic regions of the brains of  12 patients with Lesch-Nyhan disease (age, 10 to 20 years) and 15 healthy controls  (age, 12 to 23). The results were expressed as ratios of specific to nonspecific  radioactive counts. A low ratio indicates decreased dopa decarboxylase activity and  dopamine storage. RESULTS: The fluorodopa F 18 ratio was significantly lower in the  putamen (31 percent of control values), caudate nucleus (39 percent), frontal cortex  (44 percent), and ventral tegmental complex (substantia nigra and ventral tegmentum;  57 percent) in the patients with Lesch-Nyhan disease than in the controls. Uptake of  the tracer was abnormally low even in the youngest patients tested, and there was no  overlap in the values between patients and controls. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with  Lesch-Nyhan disease have abnormally few dopaminergic nerve terminals and cell  bodies. The abnormality involves all dopaminergic pathways and is not restricted to  the basal ganglia. These dopaminergic deficits are pervasive and appear to be  developmental in origin, which suggests that they contribute to the characteristic  neuropsychiatric manifestations of the disease.",

        "Title": "ASXL3-Related Disorder.",
        "Abstract": "CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: ASXL3-related disorder is characterized by developmental  delay or intellectual disability, typically in the moderate to severe range, with  speech and language delay and/or absent speech. Affected individuals may also  display autistic features. There may be issues with feeding. While dysmorphic facial  features have been described, they are typically nonspecific. Affected individuals  may also have hypotonia that can transition to spasticity resulting in unusual  posture with flexion contractions of the elbows, wrists, and fingers. Other findings  may include poor postnatal growth, strabismus, seizures, sleep disturbance, and  dental anomalies. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of ASXL3-related disorder is  established in a proband by identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in  ASXL3 by molecular genetic testing. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Feeding  therapy; gastrostomy tube placement for those with persistent feeding issues;  anti-reflux medication and/or fundoplication for those with gastroesophageal  disease; standard treatment for epilepsy, joint contractures, sleep apnea, dental  anomalies, strabismus and/or refractive error, and developmental delay /  intellectual disability. Surveillance: At each visit: Measurement of growth  parameters and nutritional status; assessment of developmental progress, behavioral  issues, new neurologic manifestations (change in tone, seizure onset and/or  frequency), mobility and self-help skills, as well as signs and symptoms of sleep  disturbance. Dental evaluation every six months after age three years or as  clinically indicated. At least annual ophthalmology evaluation. GENETIC COUNSELING:  ASXL3-related disorder is an autosomal dominant disorder typically caused by a de  novo pathogenic variant. Rarely, individuals diagnosed with ASXL3-related disorder  have the disorder as the result of a pathogenic variant inherited from a parent. If  the ASXL3 pathogenic variant identified in the proband is not identified in either  parent, the risk to sibs is presumed to be low but greater than that of the general  population because of the possibility of parental germline mosaicism. Once the ASXL3  pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal  testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are  possible.",

        "Title": "Syndromic Craniosynostosis Can Define New Candidate Genes for Suture Development or  Result from the Non-specifc Effects of Pleiotropic Genes: Rasopathies and  Chromatinopathies as Examples.",
        "Abstract": "Craniosynostosis is a heterogeneous condition caused by the premature fusion of  cranial sutures, occurring mostly as an isolated anomaly. Pathogenesis of  non-syndromic forms of craniosynostosis is largely unknown. In about 15-30% of cases  craniosynostosis occurs in association with other physical anomalies and it is  referred to as syndromic craniosynostosis. Syndromic forms of craniosynostosis arise  from mutations in genes belonging to the Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor (FGFR)  family and the interconnected molecular pathways in most cases. However it can occur  in association with other gene variants and with a variety of chromosome  abnormalities as well, usually in association with intellectual disability (ID) and  additional physical anomalies. Evaluating the molecular properties of the genes  undergoing intragenic mutations or copy number variations (CNVs) along with  prevalence of craniosynostosis in different conditions and animal models if  available, we made an attempt to define two distinct groups of unusual syndromic  craniosynostosis, which can reflect direct effects of emerging new candidate genes  with roles in suture homeostasis or a non-specific phenotypic manifestation of  pleiotropic genes, respectively. RASopathies and 9p23p22.3 deletions are reviewed as  examples of conditions in the first group. In particular, we found that  craniosynostosis is a relatively common component manifestation of  cardio-facio-cutaneous (CFC) syndrome. Chromatinopathies and neurocristopathies are  presented as examples of conditions in the second group. We observed that  craniosynostosis is uncommon on average in these conditions. It was randomly  associated with Kabuki, Koolen-de Vries/KANSL1 haploinsufficiency and Mowat-Wilson  syndromes and in KAT6B-related disorders. As an exception, trigonocephaly in  Bohring-Opitz syndrome reflects specific molecular properties of the chromatin  modifier ASXL1 gene. Surveillance for craniosynostosis in syndromic forms of  intellectual disability, as well as ascertainment of genomic CNVs by array-CGH in  apparently non-syndromic craniosynostosis is recommended, to allow for improvement  of both the clinical outcome of patients and the accurate individual diagnosis.",

        "Title": "Fragile X-Associated Diminished Ovarian Reserve and Primary Ovarian Insufficiency  from Molecular Mechanisms to Clinical Manifestations.",
        "Abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS), is caused by a loss-of-function mutation in the FMR1 gene  located on the X-chromosome, which leads to the most common cause of inherited  intellectual disability in males and the leading single-gene defect associated with  autism. A full mutation (FM) is represented by more than 200 CGG repeats within the  FMR1 gene, resulting in FXS. A FM is inherited from women carrying a FM or a  premutation (PM; 55-200 CGG repeats) allele. PM is associated with phenotypes  distinct from those associated with FM. Some manifestations of the PM are unique;  fragile-X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), and fragile-X-associated  primary ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI), while others tend to be non-specific such as  intellectual disability. In addition, women carrying a PM may suffer from  subfertility or infertility. There is a need to elucidate whether the impairment of  ovarian function found in PM carriers arises during the primordial germ cell (PGC)  development stage, or due to a rapidly diminishing oocyte pool throughout life or  even both. Due to the possibility of expansion into a FM in the next generation, and  other ramifications, carrying a PM can have an enormous impact on one's life;  therefore, preconception counseling for couples carrying the PM is of paramount  importance. In this review, we will elaborate on the clinical manifestations in  female PM carriers and propose the definition of fragile-X-associated diminished  ovarian reserve (FXDOR), then we will review recent scientific findings regarding  possible mechanisms leading to FXDOR and FXPOI. Lastly, we will discuss counseling,  preventative measures and interventions available for women carrying a PM regarding  different aspects of their reproductive life, fertility treatment, pregnancy,  prenatal testing, contraception and fertility preservation options.",

        "Title": "Phylogenetic analysis of teneurin genes and comparison to the rearrangement hot spot  elements of E. coli.",
        "Abstract": "Teneurins are a novel family of transmembrane proteins conserved between  invertebrates and vertebrates. There are two members in Drosophila, one in C.  elegans and four members in mouse. Here, we describe the analysis of the genomic  structure of the human teneurin-1 gene. The entire human teneurin-1 (TEN1) gene is  contained in eight PAC clones representing part of the chromosomal locus Xq25.  Interestingly, many X-linked mental retardation syndromes (XLMR) and non-specific  mental retardation (MRX) are mapped to this region. The location of the human TEN1  together with the neuronal expression makes TEN1 a candidate gene for XLMR and MRX.  We also identified large parts of the human teneurin-2 sequence on chromosome 5 and  sections of human teneurin-4 at chromosomal position 11q14. Database searches  resulted in the identification of ESTs encoding parts of all four human members of  the teneurin family. Analysis of the genomic organization of the Drosophila ten-a  gene revealed the presence of exons encoding a long form of ten-a, which can be  aligned with all other teneurins known. Sequence comparison and phylogenetic trees  of teneurins show that insects and vertebrates diverged before the teneurin ancestor  was duplicated independently in the two phyla. This is supported by the presence of  conserved intron positions between teneurin genes of man, Drosophila and C. elegans.  It is therefore not possible to class any of the vertebrate teneurins with either  Drosophila Ten-a or Ten-m. The C-terminal part of all teneurins harbours 26  repetitive sequence motifs termed YD-repeats. YD-repeats are most similar to the  repeats encoded by the core of the rearrangement hot spot (rhs) elements of  Escherichia coli. This makes the teneurin ancestor a candidate gene for the source  of the rhs core acquired by horizontal gene transfer.",

RESULTS: We describe a de novo 14q interstitial deletion in a 6-year-old boy with  dysmorphic facial traits such as hypertelorism, short and narrow palpebral fissures,  broad nose with anteverted nostrils, long philtrum, thin upper lip with cupid's bow,  prominent and everted lower lip, mildly low-set ears, as well as moderate  developmental delay and mild mental retardation. Array-CGH mapped the deletion to  the region 14q24.3 to 14q31.3, including 13.11\u00a0Mb, proximal to the imprinted genomic  region of 14q32. CONCLUSION: This mild phenotypic presentation suggests that the  deleted segment does not contain essential genes for early organ development.  Twenty-two genes with known functions, including Neurexin III (NRXN3, OMIM 600567),  map to the region deleted in the propositus.",

        "Abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited form of intellectual  disability and is caused by a CGG repeat expansion at Xq27.3 on the FMR1 gene. The  majority of young boys with FXS display poor attention and hyperactivity that is  disproportionate to their cognitive disability, and approximately 70% meet  diagnostic criteria for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Psychopharmacology  is employed with 82% of young males 5-17\u00a0years of age, with stimulant medication as  the most common medication prescribed. This study evaluated the effects of stimulant  medication on the academic performance, attention, motor activity, and  psychophysiological arousal of boys with FXS, as well as the concordance of effects  within individuals. Participants in this study included 12 boys with FXS who were  treated with stimulants. Participants completed videotaped academic testing on two  consecutive days and were randomly assigned to be off stimulants for 1\u00a0day and on  stimulants the other day. On each day, multiple measures including academic  performance, behavior regulation, and psychophysiological arousal were collected.  Approximately 75% of participants performed better on attention and academic  measures, and 70% showed improved physiological regulation while on stimulant  medication. A high degree of concordance among measures was found. Lower  intelligence quotient (IQ), but not age, correlated with greater improvements in  in-seat behavior. IQ and age did not relate to on-task behaviors. The frequency and  magnitude of response to stimulant medication in boys with FXS is higher than those  reported for most children with non-specific intellectual disabilities and autism  spectrum disorder.",

Pathogenic variants in MBOAT7 gene show these nonspecific  clinical features that are seen in many other neurometabolic diseases. Therefore,  specific neuroimaging findings can be valuable key factors for differential  diagnosis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of T2 hyperintensity in  bilateral globus pallidi and dentate nuclei are seen in a few neurometabolic  diseases with similar clinical features of developmental delay and hypotonia, as in  our cases. While evaluating the patients with similar phenotypes and specific MRI  findings, MBOAT7 deficiency should be kept in mind.

CASE REPORT: A male newborn  presented a dysmorphic syndrome with a marked nasal hypoplasia, a macroglossia and a  short neck. The diagnosis of chondrodysplasia punctata was made by radiography  whereas the chromosomal chart revealed the existence of an additional Y fragment in  Xpter, effectuating a partial disomy Yp and a monosomy Xpter. Molecular biology  showed a deletion of very small size, isolated and located between the gene missing  aryl sulfatase E and the microsatellite DXS 1233, sping gene MRX2 (non-specific gene  of mental retardation), and making it possible to give the reassuring elements as  regards the psychomotor prognosis, sometimes compromised in this disorder.  CONCLUSION: In case of chondrodysplasia punctata with dysmorphy, it is important to  execute a chromosomal chart in the search for a chromosomal reorganization on the X  and a study in molecular biology.",

We describe an  automated fluorometric micromethod for galactose in whole blood spotted on filter  paper. Galactose is oxidized by galactose oxidase to D-galacto-hexadialdose and H2O2  and measured as the highly fluorescent condensation product of homovanillic acid  formed when H2O2 is acted upon by horseradish peroxidase. The procedure is 10-fold  more sensitive than colorimetric procedures for galactose and is not hampered by the  nonspecific fluorescence from endogenous NADPH that is encountered in methods in  which galactose dehydrogenase is used. At a sampling rate of 40/h with a  sample-to-wash ratio of 1/2, carryover is negligible, reproducibility is excellent,  and 80% of steady state is achieved. Analytical recovery of added galactose was 95%.  The method has the requisite sensitivity and accuracy for quantification of  galactosemia and galactosuria in milkfed newborn infants and genetic evaluation of  families of patients.",

The combination of several variables (Phe,  Phe/Tyr, Phe2/Tyr) gave a safe diagnosis in more than 96% of cases. We then  computerized a random selection of our population, which was divided into two  groups: the first was \"selected\" to compute discriminant functions, while the  second, excluded from computation, was used to check the fitness of our method.  Despite the reduction of sample size, 95.2% of unknown subjects were correctly  classified. Finally, we used our equation to detect heterozygotes for  phenylketonuria in a population of 26 children, affected by non-specific mental  retardation, and their mothers. We found a high proportion of carriers for  phenylketonuria, defined as subjects having a percent probability of correct  classification higher than 90.

        "Abstract": "Mutations in hundreds of genes contribute to cognitive and behavioral dysfunction  associated with developmental brain disorders (DBDs). Due to the sheer number of  risk factors available for study combined with the cost of developing new animal  models, it remains an open question how genes should be prioritized for in-depth  neurobiological investigations. Recent reviews have argued that priority should be  given to frequently mutated genes commonly found in sporadic DBD patients. Intrigued  by this idea, we explored to what extent \"high priority\" risk factors have been  studied in animals in an effort to assess their potential for generating valuable  preclinical models capable of advancing the neurobiological understanding of DBDs.  We found that in-depth whole animal studies are lacking for many high priority  genes, with relatively few neurobiological studies performed in construct valid  animal models aimed at understanding the pathological substrates associated with  disease phenotypes. However, some high priority risk factors have been extensively  studied in animal models and they have generated novel insights into DBD  patho-neurobiology while also advancing early pre-clinical therapeutic treatment  strategies. We suggest that prioritizing model development toward genes frequently  mutated in non-specific DBD populations will accelerate the understanding of DBD  patho-neurobiology and drive novel therapeutic strategies.

        "Abstract": "CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: CHD4 neurodevelopmental disorder (CHD4-NDD) is associated  with developmental delay, speech delay, and usually mild-to-moderate intellectual  disability. Variability between individuals with CHD4-NDD is significant, and a few  have normal intelligence. Other manifestations can include brain anomalies, heart  defects, and skeletal abnormalities; less common features are hypogonadism in males,  hearing impairment, and ophthalmic abnormalities. Most affected individuals have  mild nonspecific dysmorphic facial features with or without macrocephaly.  DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of CHD4-NDD is established in a proband with  suggestive findings and a heterozygous pathogenic variant in CHD4 identified by  molecular genetic testing. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Developmental  delay / intellectual disability, cervical spine instability and risk of spinal cord  compression, refractive errors and strabismus, hearing impairment, congenital heart  defects, behavioral issues, growth delay, hypogonadism in males, and renal anomalies  are managed per standard care. Surveillance: Follow up of the common manifestations  at each clinic visit. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Activities that involve rapid  neck motion and/or possible trauma to the head and neck region (e.g., contact sports  or thrill rides at amusement parks) because of the possible increased risk for  cervical spine instability and spinal cord compression. GENETIC COUNSELING: CHD4-NDD  is an autosomal dominant disorder typically caused by a de novo pathogenic variant.  If the CHD4 pathogenic variant identified in the proband is not identified in either  parent, the risk to sibs is low (~1%) but greater than that of the general  population because of the possibility of parental germline mosaicism. Once the CHD4  pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal and  preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

        "Abstract": "Frequency and type of incontinence and its association with other variables were  assessed in females with Rett Syndrome (RS) (n\u2009=\u200963), using an adapted Dutch version  of the 'Parental Questionnaire: Enuresis/Urinary Incontinence' (Beetz et al. 1994).  Also, incontinence in RS was compared to a control group consisting of females with  non-specific (mixed) intellectual disability (n\u2009=\u200926). Urinary incontinence (UI)  (i.e., daytime incontinence and nocturnal enuresis) and faecal incontinence (FI)  were found to be common problems among females with RS that occur in a high  frequency of days/nights. UI and FI were mostly primary in nature and occur  independent of participants' age and level of adaptive functioning. Solid stool,  lower urinary tract symptoms and urinary tract infections (UTI's) were also common  problems in females with RS. No differences in incontinence between RS and the  control group were found, except for solid stool that was more common in RS than in  the control group. It is concluded that incontinence is not part of the behavioural  phenotype of RS, but that there is an increased risk for solid stool in females with  RS.",

A number of considerations  are outlined because of their relevance to both clinical practice and research  concerning assessment and treatment of sleep disturbance in children in general and  especially those with psychiatric and/or neurological conditions. These  considerations (which illustrate the importance of combined medical and  psychological involvement) are as follows: the importance of screening for sleep  disturbance which otherwise may well be overlooked; the need to specify sleep  disorders rather than simply nonspecific sleep problems as this will guide choice of  appropriate advice and treatment; the risk of sleep disorders being misdiagnosed  because of clinicians' unfamiliarity with the sleep disorders field; the possibility  that a child's sleep disturbance is of multiple aetiology; a wide range of  treatments for disturbed sleep is now described from which a choice is possible  given an accurate diagnosis; sleep problems may be intensified if a child's  condition is complicated by intellectual disability but the same principles of  assessment and management apply as in other children in the expectation that  treatment can be effective.",

It is characterized by the triad of Ichthyosis Follicularis, Alopecia, and  Photophobia from birth. Other features such as short stature, intellectual  disability, and seizures may develop in the first few years of life. Skin  histopathology is non-specific and consists of dilated hair follicles with keratin  plugs extending above the surface of the skin, decreased or absent sebaceous glands,  and decreased desmosomes in number and size. The disorder results from mutations in  the MBTPS2 gene that impairs cholesterol homeostasis and the ability to cope with  endoplasmic reticulum stress. Follicular hyperkeratosis can be treated using topical  keratolytics, emollients and urea preparations. A moderate response to acitretin  therapy has been noted in some patients. Intensive lubrication of the ocular surface  is essential. Life expectancy in patients with IFAP syndrome can vary from death in  the neonatal period to normal surviving. Cardiopulmonary complications remain the  major cause of death.",

Removal of T  cells with anti-T-cell serum eliminated LIF activity, indicating that in humans it  is probably the T cell that produces LIF. Cord blood lymphocytes produce LIF,  although spontaneous migration of leucocytes is less than in older children. The  cause of this apparently does not reside in the PMN leucocytes. Studies of children  with immunodeficiency suggest that the T-cell population in humans is heterogenous.  B-cell deficiencies such as hypogammaglobulinaemia, have normal PPD and PHA induced  LIF production, whilst some patients with ataxia-telangiectasia have defective PPD  LIF activity, their PHA LIF activity being only minimally depressed. On the other  hand, Down's syndrome patients with reduced blood T cells have remarkably deficient  LIF activity to PHA and relatively good activity to PPD. Children receiving steroid  therapy lose much of their ability to produce LIF to the specific antigen PPD, but  not to the non-specific mitogen PHA.",

        "Abstract": "Developments in human genome research enabled the first steps toward a molecular  understanding of cognitive function. That there are numerous genes on the X  chromosome affecting intelligence at the lower end of the cognitive range is no  longer in doubt. Naturally occurring mutations have so far led to the identification  of seven genes accounting for a small proportion of familial nonspecific X-linked  mental retardation. These new data indicate that normal expression of many more  X-linked and autosomal genes contribute to cognitive function. The emerging  knowledge implicating genes in intracellular signaling pathways provides the insight  to identify as candidates other X-linked and autosomal genes regulating the normal  development of cognitive function. Recent advances in unravelling the underlying  molecular complexity have been spectacular but represent only the beginning, and new  technologies will need to be introduced to complete the picture.",

Practical points concerning  the biochemical diagnosis of this condition, arising from unusual characteristics of  the deficient enzyme acetyl CoA: alpha-glucosaminide N-acetyltransferase, are  discussed. Because phenotypic manifestations of mucopolysaccharidosis are mild in  all four types of Sanfilippo's syndrome and screening tests for  mucopolysacchariduria in these patients may be negative, many cases may be passed  unrecognized or simply labelled as cases of nonspecific mental retardation. It is  suggested that Sanfilippo's syndrome is grossly underdiagnosed in the RSA and  clinicians are urged to develop a greater awareness of the existence, and often  subtle presentation, of the condition.",

Since these features may occur in most patients with  chromosomal imbalance, and the terminal 8p- syndrome has hitherto been assumed to  result from terminal deletions of 8p, ranging from p21.3 to p23, it is likely that  these features are simply related to the chromosomal imbalance rather than to band  specific imbalance of 8p11.23. The present study suggests that two different types  of deletion, interstitial and terminal, are associated with still poorly defined,  rather non-specific clinical features.",

CMV infection was confirmed by serological investigations and virus culture  in the neonatal period. Nine children had severe mental retardation and cerebral  palsy, 1 patient suffered from microcephaly, ataxia and deafness. The cranial MRI  examination showed the following abnormalities (N): dilated lateral ventricles (10)  and subarachnoid space (8), oligo/pachygyria (8), delayed/pathological myelination  (7), paraventricular cysts (6), intracerebral calcification (1). This lack of  sensitivity for calcification is explainable by the basic principles of MRI. The  paraventricular cystic lesions were adjacent to the occipital horns of the lateral  ventricles and separated only by a thin membrane. This finding might represent a  \"new sign\" for congenital CMV infection in MRI examinations, being characteristic  but nevertheless nonspecific, like calcification in CT.",

        "Abstract": "Functional imaging and gene expression studies both implicate the medial prefrontal  cortex (mPFC), particularly deep-layer projection neurons, as a potential locus for  autism pathology. Here, we explored how specific deep-layer prefrontal neurons  contribute to abnormal physiology and behavior in mouse models of autism. First, we  find that across three etiologically distinct models-in utero valproic acid (VPA)  exposure, CNTNAP2 knockout and FMR1 knockout-layer 5 subcortically projecting (SC)  neurons consistently exhibit reduced input resistance and action potential firing.  To explore how altered SC neuron physiology might impact behavior, we took advantage  of the fact that in deep layers of the mPFC, dopamine D2 receptors (D2Rs) are mainly  expressed by SC neurons, and used D2-Cre mice to label D2R+ neurons for calcium  imaging or optogenetics. We found that social exploration preferentially recruits  mPFC D2R+ cells, but that this recruitment is attenuated in VPA-exposed mice.  Stimulating mPFC D2R+ neurons disrupts normal social interaction. Conversely,  inhibiting these cells enhances social behavior in VPA-exposed mice. Importantly,  this effect was not reproduced by nonspecifically inhibiting mPFC neurons in  VPA-exposed mice, or by inhibiting D2R+ neurons in wild-type mice. These findings  suggest that multiple forms of autism may alter the physiology of specific  deep-layer prefrontal neurons that project to subcortical targets. Furthermore, a  highly overlapping population-prefrontal D2R+ neurons-plays an important role in  both normal and abnormal social behavior, such that targeting these cells can elicit  potentially therapeutic effects.",

        "Title": "Squalene Synthase Deficiency.",
        "Abstract": "CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Squalene synthase deficiency (SQSD) is a rare inborn error  of cholesterol biosynthesis with multisystem clinical manifestations similar to  Smith-Lemli-Optiz syndrome. Key clinical features include facial dysmorphism, a  generalized seizure disorder presenting in the neonatal period, nonspecific  structural brain malformations, cortical visual impairment, optic nerve hypoplasia,  profound developmental delay / intellectual disability, dry skin with  photosensitivity, and genital malformations in males. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: Individuals  with SQSD have a unique urine metabolic profile with increased saturated and  unsaturated branched-chain dicarboxylic acids and glucuronides derived from  farnesol. The diagnosis of squalene synthase deficiency is established in a proband  with characteristic urine metabolites on urine organic acids analysis or by the  identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in FDFT1 by molecular genetic  testing. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Currently there are no specific  disease-modifying treatments. Standard treatment for epilepsy, congenital heart  defects, constipation, cryptorchidism, hypospadias, spasticity, and developmental  delay / intellectual disability is appropriate. Feeding therapy may be useful,  although placement of a gastrostomy tube is recommended for those with dysphagia  and/or poor growth. In those with visual impairment, early intervention may help to  stimulate visual development. In those with sleep disturbance, a trial of melatonin  may be considered. Surveillance: At each visit: asses for new manifestations such as  seizures, changes in tone, and movement disorder; monitor developmental progress,  educational needs, and behavior; assess for evidence of aspiration or respiratory  insufficiency; assess for evidence of sleep disorder; monitor growth, nutritional  status, and signs and symptoms of constipation. Ophthalmology evaluation annually or  as clinically indicated. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Sun and UV light exposure;  skin photosensitivity has produced clinically significant UV-related sunburns within  ten minutes of direct sunlight exposure. GENETIC COUNSELING: SQSD is inherited in an  autosomal recessive manner. At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a  25% change of being affected, a 50% change of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a  25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Carrier testing for at-risk  relatives and prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk are possible if the  FDFT1 pathogenic variants in the family are known.",

        "Abstract": "Altered responses to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in obstructive sleep  apnea syndrome (OSAS), restless legs syndrome (RLS), insomnia, and sleep-deprived  healthy subjects have been reported. We have reviewed the relevant literature in  order to identify eventual distinctive electrocortical profiles based on single and  paired-pulse TMS, sensorimotor modulation, plasticity-related and repetitive TMS  measures. Although obtained from heterogeneous studies, the detected changes might  be the result of the different pathophysiological substrates underlying OSAS, RLS,  insomnia and sleep deprivation rather than reflect the general effect of  non-specific sleep loss and instability. OSAS tends to exhibit an increased motor  cortex inhibition, which is reduced in RLS; intracortical excitability seems to be  in favor of an \"activating\" profile in chronic insomnia and in sleep-deprived  healthy individuals. Abnormal plasticity-related TMS phenomena have been  demonstrated in OSAS and RLS. This review provides a perspective of TMS techniques  by further understanding the role of neurotransmission pathways and plastic  remodeling of neuronal networks involved in common sleep disorders. TMS might be  considered a valuable tool in the assessment of sleep disorders, the evaluation of  the effect of therapy and the design of non-pharmacological approaches.",

        "Title": "Secondary late-onset Lennox-Gastaut syndrome: a critical view.",
        "Abstract": "From a group of 66 patients with the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, 12 whose  manifestations had started after the 6th year of life were selected for study. These  patients were observed clinically and electroencephalographically for an average  period of 2.5 years. We concluded that the late-onset syndrome can: occur after a  long interval between diffuse encephalopathy and the first clinical manifestations,  with or without previous alterations in psychomotor development; be associated from  the onset with serious mental retardation; exhibit simple, complex and mixed  seizures similar to those observed in the early form. These patients can also:  suffer complex and mixed epileptic seizures previously unreported; paroxysmal  interictal EEG abnormalities that overlap those of the early form; and spike-slow  wave complexes in the EEG that can be actived by hyperpnea. Our results demonstrate  that the incidence of LGS after 6 years of age does not necessarily imply a lower  frequency of organic antecedents, or better neuropsychomotor development up to the  onset of the syndrome or the presence of a higher rate of nonspecific seizures  (generalized or partial seizures, and mainly those with elaborate symptomatology).  The critical and encephalographic expression of the syndrome, which is secondary and  starts after the 6th year of age, may depend at least in part on the age when  diffuse encephalopathy started.",

The gene encoding HOPA, which contains a  rare polymorphism tightly associated with non-specific mental retardation, is 25 kb  in length and consists of 44 exons. A promoter scan analysis demonstrates two  possible transcription initiation sites without TATA boxes upstream from the  putative translation initiation start site. Several informative polymorphisms are  evident in the sequence including a large pentanucleotide repeat. Northern blot  analysis of the gene transcript and its murine orthologue, MOPA-1, demonstrates that  only one transcript is expressed throughout the soma and the CNS, and that the  transcript is highly expressed during early fetal development. We conclude that the  delineation of the function of the HOPA gene locus merits further study.",

It usually manifests  during the early stages with nonspecific neurological symptoms that progress to  involve multiple systems. Its presentation similarity to other neurological  disorders makes the diagnosis difficult, hence causing a delay in treatment and  worse prognosis due to complications. If undiagnosed during childhood, it often  presents during adolescence with the most common complication of acute kidney injury  due to nephronophthisis. Here, we present a case of JS in late adolescence with  renal complications and other neurological abnormalities. We aim to emphasize the  importance of its early diagnosis by physicians in childhood to prevent further  complications. It also highlights the possible diagnostic value and significance of  brain imaging in the early stages when only mild mental retardation signs may be the  only clues.",

        "Abstract": "We report four infants (two males, two females) with ring 14 chromosome presenting  with early-onset partial epilepsy. The first seizure occurred between 3 and 6 months  (3, 3, 4, and 6mo respectively). In all four cases, diagnosis was based on early  focal seizures, rather than on psychomotor retardation or morphological features,  which were not prominent at seizure onset. Moreover, despite the young age of the  patients and the high frequency of seizures, neither epileptic spasms nor  progression to 'epileptic encephalopathy', such as hypsarrhythmia, were observed.  Epilepsy remained partial in these patients. At the most recent follow-up, all four  children had slight or mild psychomotor delay, and two of them had moderate  non-specific dysmorphic traits. Data from the literature about epilepsy in ring 14  chromosome syndrome were also reviewed. Ring 14 chromosome syndrome may be revealed  by isolated, early-onset focal epilepsy suggestive of focal lesions with only mild  mental retardation and morphological features at the time of diagnosis. The  characteristics of these observations differ from classic ring 14 syndrome, and may  enlarge this clinical spectrum. Many unanswered questions remain concerning  phenotype-genotype correlation and identification of the potential genes and  molecular mechanisms responsible for epilepsy in patients with ring 14 syndrome.",

METHODS: We conducted a descriptive cross-sectional  study on a population of 304 children assessed by their teachers as having academic  difficulty. A multidisciplinary assessment including a neurological examination, an  assessment of score of intelligence and language assessment has been performed for  209 children. RESULTS: Referring to our sample, learning disorders affect 21.3% of  children in the region Sfax. The frequency of specific learning disorder is  estimated at 10.3% (reading disorder 5.9%, dyscalculia 2.4%, reading disorder  associated with dyscalculia 2%). Non-specific learning disorders were found in 11%  of children. Etiologies in this group were dominated by mental retardation (2.1%),  inappropriate education (2.3%). CONCLUSION: Our study revealed the high frequency of  learning difficulties. It allows us to distinguish between specific learning  disabilities and non specific learning disorders secondary to neurological or  precarious socio-economic conditions. However, the profile and severity of specific  learning disorders could not be studied due to the lack of standardized Arabic tests  in Tunisia. In countries with a lack of professional and specialized unit care as in  Tunisia, reading interventions in school should be proposed. Only children with  remaining difficulties after this training will be sent to specialized  professionals.",

        "Abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Pentasomy 49,XXXXY is a rare sex chromosome polysomy usually diagnosed  postnatally by the combina- tion of mental retardation, facial dysmorphism, and  genital, cardiac and skeletal malformations. Prenatal detection of 49,XXXXY is  unusual and may be incidental due to non-specific ultrasound (US) findings. We  report a case of 49,XXXXY diagnosed prenatally and present a literature review of  the few prenatally diagnosed cases. METHODS: We searched the PubMed electronic  database without year and language restriction, using the keywords 'Prenatal',  'Diagnosis', and '49,XXXY', performing a systematic review. RESULTS: We report a  35-year-old patient with normal first-trimester US but increased combined risk for  trisomies 18 and 13. Amniocentesis at 16 weeks of gestation revealed a 49,XXXXY  karyotype. Pregnancy was terminated at 19 weeks' gestation, and a male fetus with  facial dysmorphism and hypospadia was delivered. A total of 12 articles were  identified in the systematic review. All were case reports and dated from 1980 until  2008. The mean maternal age was 34.8 years (range 30-41). The most common prenatal  US feature was cystic hygroma, present in 5 cases. Hypogenitalism was the most  common macroscopic clinical feature identified after pathology examination in 7  cases. In 2 cases, there was an increase in first-trimester combined risk for  trisomy 21. CONCLUSIONS: Pentasomy 49,XXXXY is associated with a variety of  non-specific US findings, of which cystic hygroma was the commonest. No specific  sequence of findings could be identified in this review.",

        "Abstract": "The 22q13 deletion syndrome is characterised by intellectual disability (ID),  delayed or absent speech, autistic-like behaviour and minor, nonspecific dysmorphic  features. The deletion of the SHANK3 gene is thought to be responsible for these  features. In this study, the clinical data of 7 patients with the 22q13 deletion  syndrome are presented, obtained by clinical genetic examination, direct behavioural  observation and by interview of family members and/or caregivers, complemented by  behavioural questionnaires. The specific focus was on behaviour, psychopathology and  the level of functioning during life course in order to determine common features  that might contribute to the delineation of the syndrome. Major findings were a high  incidence of psychiatric disorders, more in particular bipolar disorder (BPD) and  attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and a sudden deterioration after  acute events, in addition to a progressive loss of skills over years. Therefore, a  deletion of SHANK3 may result in a dysfunctional nervous system, more susceptible to  developmental problems and psychiatric disorders on the one hand, less able to  recuperate after psychiatric and somatic events, and more vulnerable to degeneration  at long term on the other hand. These results are exploratory and need to be  confirmed in a larger sample.",

        "Abstract": "Leukodystrophies usually affect children, but in the last several decades, many  instances of adult leukodystrophies have been reported in the medical literature.  Because the clinical manifestation of these diseases can be nonspecific, MRI can  help with establishing a diagnosis. A step-by-step approach to assist in the  diagnosis of adult leukodystrophies is proposed in this article. The first step is  to identify symmetric white matter involvement, which is more commonly observed in  these patients. The next step is to fit the symmetric white matter involvement into  one of the proposed patterns. However, a patient may present with more than one  pattern of white matter involvement. Thus, the third step is to evaluate for five  distinct characteristics-including enhancement, lesions with signal intensity  similar to that of cerebrospinal fluid, susceptibility-weighted MRI signal intensity  abnormalities, abnormal peaks at MR spectroscopy, and spinal cord involvement-to  further narrow the differential diagnosis.

As a histone demethylase, plant homeodomain finger protein 8 (Phf8) is  a candidate gene for syndromal and non-specific forms of X-chromosome-linked  intellectual disability (XLID). Here we report that Phf8 knockout mice displayed  impaired learning and memory, and impaired hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP)  without gross morphological defects. We also show that mTOR signaling pathway is  hyperactive in hippocampus in Phf8 knockout mouse. Mechanistically, we show that  demethylation of H4K20me1 by Phf8 results in transcriptional suppression of RSK1 and  homeostasis of mTOR signaling. Pharmacological suppression of mTOR signaling with  rapamycin in Phf8 knockout mice recovers the weakened LTP and cognitive deficits.  Together, our results indicate that loss of Phf8 in animals causes deficient  learning and memory by epigenetic disruption of mTOR signaling, and provides a  potential therapeutic drug target to treat XLID.",

Most of the currently used antiepileptic therapeutic agents can be  said to contain either a hydantoin or a moiety stereochemically closely related to  one. We have added a hydantoin group to naloxone and created a new combined  chemical, naloxyl-6-alpha spirohydantoin. The new compound was ten times as  effective as naloxone against hyperthermic seizures in 15-day old rat pups. Unlike  naloxone, the new naloxone-hydantoin derivative retained a protective effect 24 hrs  after injection.",

It represents a diffuse  encephalopathy with mutual transition between other age-dependent epileptic  encephalopathies. This electroclinical condition may be appropriately named  Markand-Blume-Ohtahara syndrome, after Markand and Blume, who initially described in  detail the EEG pattern of multifocal spike discharges with its major clinical  correlates, and Ohtahara, who extensively studied the group of patients with both  clinical and EEG characteristics and proposed the concept of severe epilepsy with  multiple independent spike foci, classifying it as one type of generalized epilepsy.",

During the period 1987 to 1995, 42 patients were noted  to have BGC and it constituted 0.93% of all CT scan of brain carried out during the  relevant period. These patients presented with diverse neurological and endocrine  disorders i.e., epilepsy (22 patients), mental retardation (five patients),  extra-pyramidal syndromes (five patients), abnormal behaviour (three patients),  stroke (two patients), raised intracranial tension without localizing signs (one  patient), following radiotherapy (one patient), and with hypoparathyroidism (three  patients). These patients were noted to have variable degree of calcification in  different parts of brain i.e., basal ganglia (42 cases), cerebellum (12 cases) and  cerebral cortex (nine cases). Family history of a neurological disorder was  available in five patients. This study highlights the fact that calcification of  basal ganglia and other parts of the brain is often a nonspecific finding on CT scan  and it may not be possible to establish a clinicopathological correlation.",

        "Abstract": "FMR2 is the gene associated with FRAXE fragile site non-specific mental retardation  (FRAXE MRX). Previously a male patient was identified with developmental delay and  speech problems who had a deletion within intron 3 of FMR2. No known FMR2 exonic  sequences were missing in this patient. Detailed northern blot analysis revealed  existence of a new large isoform of FRM2 in foetal brain. This isoform was  characterised and found to be due entirely to an addition of an extra 4.9 kb of the  3' UTR to the previously characterised 8.755 kb FMR2 transcript. This excluded  involvement of the large FMR2 isoform in the MRX phenotype of three individuals now  known to have the same deletion of intron 3 FMR2 sequences. Expression studies on  the new 13.7 kb FMR2 isoform show that it is expressed predominantly in foetal brain  and adult pituitary gland, whilst the expression of the shorter previously  characterised 8.755 kb isoform is broader, including testis, thymus and placenta.  Possible consequences of the alternative processing and expression of FMR2 for the  molecular pathology of FRAXE MRX are discussed.",

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: This study presents two experiments that investigated whether children  with autism were susceptible to the Thatcher illusion. Perception of the Thatcher  illusion requires being able to compute second-order configural relations for facial  stimuli. METHOD: In both experiments children with autism were matched for  non-verbal and verbal ability with a group of children with moderate (non-specific)  mental retardation (MLD) and a group of typically developing children respectively.  Participants were asked to detect the 'unusual' face in a  two-alternative-forced-choice version of the Margaret Thatcher illusion with  grey-scale (Experiment 1) and monochrome 'Mooney' face images (Experiment 2). In  Experiment 1 participants also performed a control task where buildings had been  doctored in the same way as the facial stimuli. RESULTS: Children with autism were  as susceptible to the Thatcher illusion as both control groups, in terms of accuracy  and reaction time to make decisions about which face was unusual. Children with  autism performed more accurately than children with MLD in the buildings task.  CONCLUSION: Children with autism are able to compute second-order configural  features in faces and exhibit no difference in face processing, relative to  appropriate control groups.",

The clinical features are remarkably similar to those  recently recognized and increasingly reported in full short arm (9p) trisomy and  should be considered a modification of the same syndrome. In addition to  non-specific mental retardation and short stature, there is, in common, a  characteristic facies, including down-turned corners of the mouth, a slightly  bulbous nose, moderately large ears, suggestively wide-set eyes with an  antimongoloid slant, dysplasia and hypolasis of the nails, clindactyly of the 5th  fingers, and abnormal dermatoglyphs. It appears that the 'trisomy 9p syndrome' in  its variant forms, including trisomies for more or less than just the short (p) arm,  is one of the most common clinical autosome anomalies in humans, exceeded only by  trisomy 21 (Down's syndrome) and possibly trisomies of chromosomes 13 and 18.",

        "Title": "Kinetic comparison of tissue non-specific and placental human alkaline phosphatases  expressed in baculovirus infected cells: application to screening for Down's  syndrome.",
        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: In humans, there are four alkaline phosphatases, and each form exhibits  a characteristic pattern of tissue distribution. The availability of an easy method  to reveal their activity has resulted in large amount of data reporting correlations  between variations in activity and illnesses. For example, alkaline phosphatase from  neutrophils of mothers pregnant with a trisomy 21 fetus (Down's syndrome) displays  significant differences both in its biochemical and immunological properties, and in  its affinity for some specific inhibitors. RESULTS: To analyse these differences,  the biochemical characteristics of two isozymes (non specific and placental alkaline  phosphatases) were expressed in baculovirus infected cells. Comparative analysis of  the two proteins allowed us to estimate the kinetic constants of denaturation and  sensitivity to two inhibitors (L-p-bromotetramisole and thiophosphate), allowing  better discrimination between the two enzymes. These parameters were then used to  estimate the ratio of the two isoenzymes in neutrophils of pregnant mothers with or  without a trisomy 21 fetus. It appeared that the placental isozyme represented 13%  of the total activity of neutrophils of non pregnant women. This proportion did not  significantly increase with normal pregnancy. By contrast, in pregnancies with  trisomy 21 fetus, the proportion reached 60-80% of activity. CONCLUSION:  Over-expression of the placental isozyme compared with the tissue-nonspecific form  in neutrophils of mother with a trisomy 21 fetus may explain why the characteristics  of the alkaline phosphatase in these cells is different from normal. Application of  this knowledge could improve the potential of using alkaline phosphatase  measurements to screen for Down's syndrome.",

The patient's variant is  novel and some features such as clivus dysplasia, occult spina bifida, tapered  fingers, and upturned fleshy earlobes have not been reported in the literature  before. This new case report will expand the knowledge of BBIS and provide more  information about the genetic variants and phenotypic spectrum. Also, new cases with  THOC6 variants will define the core clinical features and common phenotypes of the  BBIS over time.",

        "Title": "Testing for Inborn Errors of Metabolism.",
        "Abstract": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This article provides an overview of genetic metabolic disorders  that can be identified by metabolic tests readily available to neurologists, such as  tests for ammonia, plasma amino acids, and urine organic acids. The limitations of  these tests are also discussed, as they only screen for a subset of the many inborn  errors of metabolism that exist. RECENT FINDINGS: Advances in next-generation  sequencing and the emerging use of advanced metabolomic screening have made it  possible to diagnose treatable inborn errors of metabolism that are not included in  current newborn screening programs. Some of these inborn errors of metabolism are  especially likely to present with nonspecific neurologic phenotypes, such as  epilepsy, ataxia, or intellectual disability. However, cost may be a barrier to  obtaining these newer tests. It is important to keep in mind that common metabolic  testing may lead to treatable diagnoses. Resources are available to guide  neurologists in diagnosing genetic metabolic conditions. SUMMARY: This article  introduces the clinical presentations of treatable inborn errors of metabolism that  are important for neurologists to consider in patients of all ages. Inborn errors of  metabolism are rare, but they can present with neurologic symptoms. Newborns are now  screened for many treatable metabolic disorders, but these screening tests may miss  milder presentations of treatable inborn errors of metabolism that present later in  life. These patients may present to adult neurologists who may be less likely to  consider metabolic genetic testing.",

Clinically, this is  a recognizable microdeletion syndrome associated with intellectual disability (ID),  acquired microcephaly, typical dysmorphic features, structural anomalies of the  brain, and nonspecific multiple organ anomalies. Most of the reported cases have  cytogenetically visible interstitial deletions or subtelomeric microdeletions. We  report on a boy with global developmental delay, distinct dysmorphic features,  dysgenesis of the corpus callosum, limb anomalies, and genital hypoplasia who has a  small interstitial deletion of the long arm of chromosome 6 detected by comparative  genomic hybridization (CGH). The deleted region spans around 1 Mb of DNA and  contains only two coding genes, ARID1B and ZDHHC14. To the best of our knowledge,  this case represents the typical phenotype with the smallest deletion reported so  far. We discuss the possible role of these genes in the phenotypic manifestations.",

        "Title": "Neuropsychiatric perspectives on nodding syndrome in northern Uganda: a case series  study and a review of the literature.",
        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Nodding Syndrome (NS), previously called Nodding Disease, is a chronic  and debilitating illness affecting thousands of children aged 3-18 years in  post-conflict Northern Uganda and South Sudan. Characterised by malnutrition,  stunted growth, mental retardation and seizures, some researchers have designated it  as epilepsy. With reports appearing in Northern Uganda in1997, NS reached epidemic  proportions around 2000-2003 when people were moved into Internally Displaced  People's (IDP) camps. Investigations for infections (onchocerciasis) and toxins have  been inconclusive as to cause, treatment or outcome. No study has addressed the  possible relationship of NS to childhood war-trauma experiences. OBJECTIVE: To  explore a possible relationship of exposure to prolonged war-trauma and the  emergence of epidemic NS in Northern Uganda. METHOD: This study was a case-series  descriptive psychiatric naturalistic field observations of NS cases from homesteads  in Northern Uganda and psychiatric investigations and treatment of NS cases referred  to Mulago National Referral and Teaching Hospital. RESULTS: Detailed Psychiatric  clinical evaluations and field observations revealed that NS children had been  exposed to severe war-related psychological and physical trauma as well as  non-specific CNS insults including untreated CNS infections/infestations and  malnutrition possibly causing seizures. Many children suffered post-traumatic stress  disorder (PTSD) and depression. CONCLUSION: NS could present as an association of  childhood complex PTSD, (called Developmental Trauma Disorder), occurring in the  chronically war-traumatised children of Northern Uganda, complicated by severe  prolonged depression with its characteristic symptoms of psychomotor retardation,  anxiety, anhedonia and anorexia. This, coupled with food shortages, resulted in  malnutrition, wasting and stunted growth with severe avitaminoses. Many children had  seizures. All this calls for multi-disciplinary treatment approaches.",

        "Abstract": "Iodine deficiency is the most common cause of hypothyroidism worldwide. In persons  living in iodine-replete areas, causes are congenital, spontaneous because of  chronic autoimmune disease (atrophic autoimmune thyroiditis or goitrous autoimmune  thyroiditis [Hashimoto's thyroiditis]), or iatrogenic because of goitrogens, drugs,  or destructive treatment for thyrotoxicosis. Screening for congenital hypothyroidism  exists and its use prevents mental retardation. The prevalence of spontaneous  hypothyroidism is between 1% and 2% and is more common in older women and 10 times  more common in women than in men. A significant proportion of subjects have  asymptomatic chronic autoimmune thyroiditis and 8% of women (10% of women over 55  years of age) and 3% of men have subclinical hypothyroidism. Approximately one third  of patients with newly diagnosed overt hypothyroidism have received destructive  therapy for hyperthyroidism and indefinite surveillance is required. There is not  much that can be done to prevent the occurrence of spontaneous autoimmune  hypothyroidism, but if identified early, something can be done to prevent  progression to overt disease. Controversy exists as to whether healthy adults would  benefit from screening for autoimmune thyroid disease because a significant  proportion of subjects tested will have evidence of mild thyroid failure. Case  finding in women at menopause or visiting a primary care physician with nonspecific  symptoms appears justified.",

        "Abstract": "Tandem repeats of a novel, putative, zinc-binding motif (MYM) have been described  within the products of two, highly homologous genes: ZNF198/RAMP/FIM and  ZNF261/DXS6673E. ZNF198, mapping to 13q11-q12, was recently shown to fuse to the  fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 gene in the t(8;13)(p11;q11-q12) rearrangement  associated with a stem cell leukemia/lymphoma syndrome. ZNF261 at Xq13.1 is  disrupted by a t(X;13)(q13.1;q32) rearrangement in a mentally retarded patient and  is a candidate gene for nonspecific X-linked mental retardation. Here we have cloned  another member of this family, designated ZNF258, and mapped it to chromosome band  14q12. In addition, ZNF262/KIAA0425 was identified as a further member of the family  and mapped to 1p32-p34. The predicted protein products of ZNF258 and ZNF262 maintain  the repeats of the MYM motif. Isolation of these new members will facilitate the  functional characterization of the MYM family and motif.",

        "Abstract": "The clinicopathological features of a previously unrecognised type of acute  encephalopathy prevalent among Japanese children is described by reviewing the  records of 13 consecutive patients treated and 28 previously reported cases. The  hallmark of this encephalopathy, proposed to be a novel entity termed acute  necrotising encephalopathy of childhood, is multiple, necrotic brain lesions showing  a symmetric distribution. The encephalopathy was noted in previously healthy  children after respiratory tract infections, with presenting symptoms of coma,  convulsions, vomiting, hyperpyrexia, and hepatomegaly. Laboratory examinations  disclosed liver dysfunction, uraemia, and hypoproteinaemia. The histological  appearance of the liver was variable and non-specific. Cerebrospinal fluid contained  an increased amount of protein. Computed tomography and MRI showed the presence of  symmetrically distributed brain lesions of the thalamus, cerebral white matter,  brainstem, and cerebellum. Necropsy examination confirmed extensive fresh necrosis  of these regions with evidence of local breakdown of the blood-brain barrier. Based  on the characteristic combination of clinical and pathological findings, acute  necrotising encephalopathy of childhood can be distinguished from previously known  encephalopathies, including Reye's syndrome.",

        "Abstract": "There is an increasing awareness that alcohol and drug abuse and smoking are not  only harmful for the consumer but will also, when taken by a pregnant woman,  adversely affect her unborn child. The consequence of the abuse will result from a  combination of specific toxic effects of abusing substances and a nonspecific effect  from the often very unstable environment of an alcohol- or drug-dependent mother.  Poor prenatal care is a common finding in alcohol and drug abuse leading to a high  incidence of complications during pregnancy and delivery including premature labor  and small-for-gestational-age babies. An increased perinatal mortality has been  reported following all types of abuse including tobacco use, probably as a  consequence of poor prenatal care as well as of a toxic effect on the fetus.  Withdrawal symptoms after birth are most prominent in opiate addiction. The already  intrauterinely damaged child will if it stays with its parents often continue to be  exposed to several abverse environmental factors. However, symptoms such as mental  retardation following alcohol abuse and hyperactivity and emotional disturbances  following drug exposure during intrauterine life have also been found in children  who have been taken from the parents and placed in foster homes immediately after  birth. This means that children of abusing parents both in their custody and in  foster home will have to be regarded as risk children that should be subjected to  careful medical and psychological follow-up.",

Here we report the identification and characterization of the orthologous  mouse gene, Arhgef6. The gene transcript of approximately 4.4 kb is present in  various mouse tissues indicating ubiquitous expression as found for human ARHGEF6.  The open reading frame encodes a polypeptide of 771 amino acids with high homology  to human ARHGEF6. The structural motifs of both proteins are conserved including an  N-terminal CH domain, followed by an SH3 domain, and a tandem organization of the DH  and PH domains. Analysis of the temporal expression pattern revealed that Arhgef6 is  strongly expressed in the very early embryo and somewhat less in later stages. A  genomic cosmid clone containing Arhgef6 exons 1 and 2 has been isolated and used for  mapping the gene on the mouse X chromosome.",

        "Abstract": "MED13L syndrome is a rare congenital disorder comprising moderate intellectual  disability, hypotonia and facial dysmorphism. Whole exome or genome sequencing in  patients with non-specific neurodevelopmental disorders leads to identification of  an increasing number of MED13L missense variations of unknown signification. The aim  of our study was to identify relevant annotation parameters enhancing discrimination  between candidate pathogenic or neutral missense variations, and to assess the  performance of seven meta-predictor algorithms: BayesDel, CADD, DANN, FATHMM-XF,  M-CAP, MISTIC and REVEL for the classification of MED13L missense variants.  Significant differences were identified for five parameters: global conservation  through verPhyloP and verPhCons scores; physico-chemical difference between amino  acids estimated by Grantham scores; conservation of residues between MED13L and  MED13 protein; proximity to phosphorylation sites for pathogenic variations. Among  the seven selected in-silico tools, BayesDel, REVEL, and MISTIC provided the most  interesting performances to discriminate pathogenic from neutral missense  variations. Individual gene parameter studies with MED13L have provided expertise on  elements of annotation improving meta-predictor choices. The in-silico approach  allows us to make valuable hypotheses to predict the involvement of these amino  acids in MED13L pathogenic missense variations.",

        "Abstract": "Joubert syndrome (JBTS) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by  intellectual disability, hypotonia, ataxia, tachypnea/apnea, and abnormal eye  movements. A pathognomonic midbrain-hindbrain malformation seen on cranial magnetic  resonance imaging (MRI), which consists of hypoplasia of the midline cerebellar  vermis that resembles the cross-section through a molar tooth, has been described  previously. The molar tooth sign is defined by a peculiar appearance resembling a  molar tooth secondary to an abnormally deep interpeduncular fossa and enlarged  superior cerebellar peduncles on axial images at the pontomesencephalic level. The  term Joubert Syndrome and Related Disorders (JSRD) has recently been adopted to  describe all disorders presenting the \"molar tooth sign\" (MTS) on brain imaging.  JSRD is characterized by lack of decussation of the superior cerebellar peduncles,  central pontine tracts and corticospinal tracts suggesting defective axon guidance.  Prenatal sonographic findings in fetuses with JSRD are relatively nonspecific and  include increased nuchal translucency, enlarged cisterna magna, cerebellar vermian  agenesis, occipital encephalocele, ventriculomegaly and polydactyly. We report a  case of JSRD detected prenatally at 23 weeks of gestation. The fetus in the present  case had a normal karyotype. Sonographic features of the fetus included polydactyly,  partial vermian hypoplasia, dilated 4(th) ventricle and mild ventriculomegaly which  were also confirmed by prenatal MRI. MTS was demonstrated in a postnatal MRI after  pregnancy termination.",

        "Title": "Pathogenic WDFY3 variants cause neurodevelopmental disorders and opposing effects on  brain size.",
        "Abstract": "The underpinnings of mild to moderate neurodevelopmental delay remain elusive, often  leading to late diagnosis and interventions. Here, we present data on exome and  genome sequencing as well as array analysis of 13 individuals that point to  pathogenic, heterozygous, mostly de novo variants in WDFY3 (significant de novo  enrichment P = 0.003) as a monogenic cause of mild and non-specific  neurodevelopmental delay. Nine variants were protein-truncating and four missense.  Overlapping symptoms included neurodevelopmental delay, intellectual disability,  macrocephaly, and psychiatric disorders (autism spectrum disorders/attention deficit  hyperactivity disorder). One proband presented with an opposing phenotype of  microcephaly and the only missense-variant located in the PH-domain of WDFY3.  Findings of this case are supported by previously published data, demonstrating that  pathogenic PH-domain variants can lead to microcephaly via canonical Wnt-pathway  upregulation. In a separate study, we reported that the autophagy scaffolding  protein WDFY3 is required for cerebral cortical size regulation in mice, by  controlling proper division of neural progenitors. Here, we show that proliferating  cortical neural progenitors of human embryonic brains highly express WDFY3, further  supporting a role for this molecule in the regulation of prenatal neurogenesis. We  present data on Wnt-pathway dysregulation in Wdfy3-haploinsufficient mice, which  display macrocephaly and deficits in motor coordination and associative learning,  recapitulating the human phenotype. Consequently, we propose that in humans WDFY3  loss-of-function variants lead to macrocephaly via downregulation of the Wnt  pathway. In summary, we present WDFY3 as a novel gene linked to mild to moderate  neurodevelopmental delay and intellectual disability and conclude that variants  putatively causing haploinsufficiency lead to macrocephaly, while an opposing  pathomechanism due to variants in the PH-domain of WDFY3 leads to microcephaly.",

        "Abstract": "Malformations are common causes of pediatric morbidity and mortality, and genetic  factors are a significant component of their etiology. Autosomal deletions, in  almost all cases, cause a nonspecific embryopathy that presents after birth as  growth failure, mental retardation, and multiple malformations. We have constructed  a chromosome map of autosomal deletions associated with 47 different congenital  malformations, using detailed clinical and cytogenetic information on 1,753 patients  with nonmosaic single contiguous autosomal deletions. The 1,753 deletions involved  258 (89%) of 289 possible autosomal bands (by the use of ISCN 400-band  nomenclature), giving a total of 4,190 deleted autosomal bands for analysis. We  compared the band distributions of deletions associated with common major  malformations with the distribution of all 1,753 deletions. We noted 283 positive  associations between deleted bands and specific malformations, of which 199 were  significant (P<.05, P>.001) and 84 were highly significant (P<.001). These  \"malformation-associated bands\" (MABs) were distributed among 137  malformation-associated chromosome regions (MACRs). An average of 6 MABs in 2.9  MACRs were detected per malformation studied; 18 (6%) of 283 MABs contain a locus  known to be associated with the particular malformation. A further 18 (6%) of 283  are in seven recognized specific malformation-associated aneuploid regions.  Therefore, 36 (26%) of 137 of the MACRs contain an MAB coinciding with a previously  recognized locus or malformation-associated aneuploid region.

        "Abstract": "Joubert syndrome is characterized by neonatal breathing disorders that are thought  to improve with age, but recent findings indicate that sleep-related breathing  disorders can occur even after infancy. A 15-year-old boy who had a breathing  disorder during the neonatal period developed mental retardation and hypotonia. He  was diagnosed with Joubert syndrome based on the clinical course and molar tooth  sign on brain MRI at 9 years of age. Daytime sleepiness developed at 15 years of  age. An interview and the results of sleep questionnaires (Epworth sleepiness scale,  Pediatric sleep questionnaire and Pittsburgh sleep quality index), indicated that  the patient had daytime sleepiness and a sleep-related breathing disorder. Overnight  polysomnography showed central apnea with an apnea hypopnea index of 16, indicating  that the patient had central sleep apnea syndrome. After nighttime oxygen therapy at  home for one month, the sleep questionnaires showed improved daytime sleepiness and  the sleep-related breathing disorder. The improvement persisted for over 12 months  thereafter. Sleep-related breathing disorders could be indicated by non-specific  complaints such as daytime sleepiness and lead to appropriate therapies. Such  disorders should be considered as a complication of Joubert syndrome even after  infancy.",

Its origin may be functional or biological and it has a higher  prevalence in females and in psychologically impaired individuals. Seventy per cent  of autistic patients have SIB. Seventy-five per cent of factitial injuries are  located in the head and neck region. A paediatric case report concerning a  4-year-old autistic female is presented. Detailed medical history, physical  examination, clinical intraoral and radiographic examination, incisional biopsy,  neuropaediatrical, psychological and speech evaluation were undertaken. Diagnosis  included hypochromic macrocytic anaemia, caries, coronal fracture, factitial ulcer,  factitial periodontitis, self-extraction of primary teeth and permanent teeth buds,  non-specific oral ulcer with inflammatory reaction, mild mental retardation, speech  impairment, autistic syndrome and self injurious behaviour consisting of putting  fingers and foreign objects in the gingiva, fingernail biting and hair pulling.  Differential diagnosis included hystiocitosis X, prepuberal periodontitis and  leukocyte adhesion deficiency. Dental preventive and restorative treatment was  performed. Non-contingent reinforcement therapy was successfully used to diminish  SIB. Treatment of factitial oral injuries must be interdisciplinary and requires  cooperation of the patient, the parents, health care providers, and medical team.",

        "Title": "Prospective evaluation of esophageal motor dysfunction in Down's syndrome.",
        "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and way of  presentation of esophageal motor dysfunction in a nonselected population of subjects  with Down's syndrome. METHODS: The study was conducted in 58 Down's syndrome  patients and 38 healthy controls. A global symptom score and individual scores for  dysphagia for liquids and solids, heartburn, vomiting/regurgitation, and chest pain  were obtained. Esophageal function was evaluated initially by scintigraphy using  liquid and semisolid bolus. Time-activity curves based on the mean condensed images  were used to calculate residual activity at 100 s after swallowing. According to  both scintigraphy and clinical evaluation results, participants underwent a  radiological and manometric study. RESULTS: The most frequent symptoms in Down's  syndrome patients were: dysphagia for liquids (n = 9), dysphagia for solids (n =  10), vomiting/regurgitation (n = 8), and chest pain (n = 2). Liquid and semisolid  retention of the tracer was significantly higher in Down's syndrome patients than in  controls (p < 0.05). In 15 participants with Down's syndrome, tracer retention was  higher than the 95 percentile of controls' retention. No correlation was found  between the global or individual symptom score and esophageal retention quantified  by scintigraphy. Hypothyroidism was unrelated to esophageal symptoms or retention.  Five of the 15 esophagograms performed were abnormal, showing barium retention  and/or esophageal dilation. Manometry showed achalasia in two subjects, total body  aperistalsis in one, and nonspecific esophageal motor disorder in two. CONCLUSION:  Esophageal motor disorders, particularly achalasia, are frequent in individuals with  Down's syndrome. Awareness of esophageal dysmotility in this population is  important, even though symptoms are not evident, to avoid potential complications.",

        "Abstract": "Chromosome imbalance affecting the short arm of chromosome 4 results in a variety of  distinct clinical conditions. Most of them share a number of manifestations, such as  mental retardation, microcephaly, pre- and post-natal growth retardation, anteverted  and low-set ears, that can be considered as nonspecific signs, generally  attributable to gene dosage impairment. On the other hand, more distinctive  phenotypic traits correlate with the segmental aneuploidy. Duplications of the  distal half of 4p give rise to the partial trisomy 4 syndrome, characterized by a  \"boxer\" nose configuration and deep-set eyes. These signs are usually observed even  in cases of small terminal duplications. Haploinsufficiency of 4p16.3 results in the  so-called Wolf-Hirschhorn (WH) syndrome, a contiguous gene syndrome characterized by  maxillary hypoplasia, large and protruding eyes, high nasal bridge, skeletal  abnormalities, and midline defects. The smallest overlapping deletion described so  far as a cause of this condition is only 165 kb long, suggesting that one or a few  genes in this region act as \"master\" regulators of different developmental pathways.  A \"tandem\" duplication of 4p16.1p16.3 was detected in association with a subtle  deletion of 4p16.3pter on the same chromosome in a patient with the WH phenotype.  The 3.2 Mb deletion, spanning the genomic region from the vicinity of D4S43 to the  telomere, encompasses the recently delimited \"WHS critical region\" [Wright et al.,  1997: Hum. Mol. Genet. 6:317-324]. This unusual chromosome rearrangement resulted in  WH phenotype, clinical manifestations of partial 4p trisomy being mild or absent.  This observation led us to speculate that the regulatory gene/genes in the critical  WH region affect the expression of other genes in a dose-dependent manner.  Haploinsufficiency of this region could be more deleterious than various partial  trisomies.",

        "Abstract": "We report on two siblings doubly heterozygous for null mutations in the recently  identified AGS5 gene SAMHD1. The older female child showed mild intellectual  disability with microcephaly. Her brother demonstrated a significant spastic  paraparesis with normal intellect and head size. Both children had an unclassified  chronic inflammatory skin condition with chilblains, and recurrent mouth ulcers. One  child had a chronic progressive deforming arthropathy of the small and large joints,  with secondary contractures. This family illustrate the remarkable phenotypic  diversity accruing from mutations in genes associated with Aicardi-Gouti\u00e8res  syndrome (AGS). The association of arthropathy with SAMHD1 mutations highlights a  phenotypic overlap of AGS with familial autoinflammatory disorders such as chronic  infantile neurological cutaneous and articular syndrome (CINCA). This family  therefore illustrate the need to consider mutation analysis of SAMHD1 in  non-specific inflammatory phenotypes of childhood. We propose that arthropathy with  progressive contractures should now be considered part of the spectrum of  Aicardi-Gouti\u00e8res syndrome because of SAMHD1 mutations.",

The common feature is the quantitative  depletion of mitochondrial DNA without qualitative defects. Diagnosis of these  diseases poses a challenge and whole exome sequencing is often needed for their  diagnoses. CASE: Two siblings of a quartet family, presenting with hypotonia,  microcephaly and severe intellectual disability, have been diagnosed to harbor two  heterozygous variants in trans in the DTYMK gene of the thymidine biosynthesis  pathway. Mitochondrial DNA depletion has been demonstrated in silico in the more  severe sibling. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest the consideration of incorporating DTYMK as  one of the associated genes of mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome (MDDS). DTYMK  may be the missing link in the mitochondrial nucleotide salvage pathway but further  characterization and additional evidence would be needed.",

        "Abstract": "Danon disease is a rare X-linked disorder comprising hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,  skeletal myopathy, intellectual disability, and retinopathy; mutations of the  lysosome-associated membrane protein gene LAMP2 are responsible. Most affected  persons exhibit \"private\" point mutations; small locus rearrangements have recently  been reported in four cases. Here, we describe the clinical, pathologic, and  molecular features of a male proband and his affected mother with Danon disease and  a small LAMP2 microduplication. The proband presented at age 12 years with exercise  intolerance, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and increased creatine kinase.  Endomyocardial biopsy findings were nonspecific, showing myocyte hypertrophy and  reactive mitochondrial changes. Quadriceps muscle biopsy demonstrated the  characteristic autophagic vacuoles with sarcolemma-like features. LAMP2 tissue  immunostaining was absent; however, LAMP2 sequencing was normal.  Deletion/duplication testing by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification  (MLPA) assay revealed a 1.5kb microduplication containing LAMP2 exons 4 and 5.  RT-PCR studies were consistent with the inclusion of these two duplicated exons in  the final spliced transcript, resulting in a frameshift. The proband's mother, who  had died following cardiac transplantation due to suspected myocarditis at age 35,  was reviewed and was shown to be affected upon immunostaining of banked myocardial  tissue. This case constitutes the second report of a pathogenic microduplication in  Danon disease, and illustrates a number of potential diagnostic pitfalls. Firstly,  given the imperfect sensitivity of LAMP2 sequencing, tissue immunostaining and/or  MLPA should be considered as a diagnostic adjunct in the workup for this disorder.  Secondly, the pathological findings in myocardium may be falsely indicative of  relatively common conditions such as myocarditis.",

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hypothalamic hamartoma with gelastic seizures (HHGS) is an uncommon,  often unrecognized, epileptic syndrome with onset of symptoms during childhood. AIM:  In order to study the occurrence, clinical symptoms and different investigations of  HHGS in Swedish children and adolescents, a nationwide survey was undertaken.  Methods. Twelve patients, three females, aged 5 to 19 years were identified and  their hospital records reviewed. MRI examinations were reinvestigated. RESULTS:  Gelastic seizures were noted before the age of six months in seven patients in at  least three as early as the neonatal period. During the course of disease one or  more other seizure types developed in 11 patients. Behaviour disorder became  subsequently obvious in ten patients, and mental retardation was diagnosed in seven.  Precocious puberty was diagnosed in five patients. A total of 46 MRI examinations  were performed in 11 patients, revealing hypothalamic tumors, eight of which were  drooping with a broad base. Interictal and ictal EEG examinations were pathological  in 10 patients with nonspecific results. Nonspecific results were also found on  SPECT and PET performed in six and two patients, respectively. Available  antiepileptic drugs had little or no effect on gelastic seizures, but some effect on  other seizure types. Precocious puberty was treated with a GnRH-agonist.  Neurosurgical treatment of the hypothalamic hamartoma, performed in three patients,  had a rather good outcome concerning gelastic seizures and behaviour. Vagal nerve  stimulation in five patients had no effect. CONCLUSIONS: Review of the literature  and experience from this group's own cases confirms that early diagnosis of HHGS is  important. Hypothalamic hamartoma should be considered in any child with laughing  attacks. MRI investigation is compulsory, and neurosurgery the most important  treatment.",

        "Abstract": "INTRODUCTION: and importance: WAGR syndrome is a rare genetic disorder consist of  Wilms tumor, Aniridia, Genitourinary abnormalities, and Intellectual disability.  During the enduring COVID-19 pandemic, it has become extremely important to document  the properties of SARS-CoV-2 and its interactions with other diseases. Herein, we  present the first case of Syrian child with WAGR syndrome that has been affected by  COVID-19. CASE PRESENTATION: a 17-month-old boy was diagnosed with WAGR syndrome.  During the follow-up, he developed rhinorrhea, cough, and moderate dyspnea with no  fever. Computed tomography scan was normal and polymerase chain reaction test was  positive. The child started an oxygen therapy with broad-spectrum antibiotics based  on laboratory findings. His vital signs and laboratory values improved gradually  without any further complications. DISCUSSION: COVID-19 has a special interest  regarding its course in children. Although the clinical presentation varies, the  current data reveal a better prognosis in children. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 infection  may result in non-specific symptoms and normal CT scan findings in children with  WAGR syndrome. The accurate diagnosis, effective isolation and monitoring of the  child, and successful management can improve the prognosis and shorten the infection  period.",

Most women are asymptomatic or experience  nonspecific symptoms, which can lead to long-term sequelae in newborns including  neurological impairment, hearing loss, and mental retardation. A 41-year-old woman  (G6 P2), with a medical history of epilepsy, presented for her routine anomaly scan  at 20 + 4/40. A single finding of echogenic bowel was noted on ultrasound which  prompted a full investigation. A repeat ultrasound only five days later demonstrated  progressive changes, which included bilateral ventriculomegaly with oedema of the  posterior ventricular wall, periventricular hyperechogenicity, and enlargement of  the cisterna magna. CMV DNA was detected at amniocentesis. Ultrasound findings are  not diagnostic for CMV with only 11-15% of at-risk fetuses being identified.  Unfortunately, these findings may be the only indication of an abnormality. There is  a well-documented lack of awareness surrounding CMV and screening is not routinely  offered. Given the risk to the pregnancy of CMV and to subsequent pregnancies,  simple education at the start of a pregnancy could significantly reduce the  incidence of maternal CMV.",

        "Abstract": "Two cases (father and son) clinically diagnosed as Menzel type of heredoataxia were  examined pathologically, and found nonspecific, multisystem degenerations of central  nervous system spreading from brain stem to cerebellum and spinal cord. Common  neuropathological findings of both cases were marked neuronal loss, demyelination  and cellular and fibrous gliosis in pallidum (esp. internal segment), body of Luys,  substantia nigra, dentate nucleus, red nucleus, cranial and spinal motor nuclei,  spinocerebellar tracts and Clarke's column. There were no abnormalities in cerebral  cortex, caudate nucleus, putamen, thalamus and inferior olive nucleus. These  findings had enough similarity to that of Japanese type of Joseph disease. The son  who died 36 years old had showed clinically hyperreflexia, cerebellar ataxia,  dystonic extrapyramidal movement, muscle atrophy and bulging eyes. Dominant  pathological findings compared to the father case were neuronal loss of substantia  nigra and red nucleus, fibrous gliosis of superior peduncles and grumose  degeneration of dentate nucleus. The father case died 76 years old had showed  hyporeflexia, cerebellar ataxia and no bulging eyes clinically. The pathologica  findings of pallidum, cranial and spinal motor nuclei, dorsal column and  spinocerebellar tracts were more dominant than the other reported case. Dementia,  mental retardation, epileptic episodes were not found in this family pedigree.  Pathological changes of pallidonigral, pallidoluysian, dentatorubral and spinal cord  which were common in Japanese type were less found in original type of Joseph  disease in Europe. Authors discussed this difference in relation with progressive  pallidumatrophy, dentato-rubro-pallido-luisian atrophy and hereditary spastic  ataxia. According to the classification of clinical feature of Joseph disease in  Europe, the father case was classified as type III (Machado phenotype) and the son  case was as type I (Joseph phenotype). Reported cases of type III and familial  autopsy cases of Joseph disease were so rare in Japan, authors reported on their  clinicopathological findings.",

        "Abstract": "DXS6673E is a candidate gene for nonspecific X-linked mental retardation and encodes  a novel Zn-finger protein. The ortholog murine gene DXHXS6673E in XC-D was isolated  and characterized. It is ubiquitously expressed in all embryonic stages and adult  tissues. Two different transcription start sites exist that result in two major  transcripts of 6055 and 5352 nucleotides, each composed of 25 exons. Exon 1A is  tissue specific, whereas exon 1B is transcribed constitutively. Both variants are  translated into the same 1370-amino-acid protein. Transcripts are subject to  alternative splicing at the 5'-end. Some of the isoforms are developmental stage and  tissue specific. Among them, one was present only in embryos and adult brain.  Sequence analysis demonstrated evolutionary conservation down to the arthropods and  defined several conserved protein motifs. Subcellular localization studies with  green fluorescent protein as a reporter showed that DXS6673E is predominantly  located in the nucleus due to several functional nuclear localization signals. Three  distinct protein distribution patterns in COS-7 cells could be identified.",

Two prior reports noted an  anticonvulsant effect from high-dose dextromethorphan (DM) in this disorder,  although the two reported patients demonstrated widely disparate DM requirements and  drug levels. We report two children with NKH who also demonstrated disparate and  variable DM metabolism which markedly influenced the dose-concentration-response  relationship. Levels of DM and its primary metabolite dextrorphan (DX) were utilized  to guide DM therapy and exhibited patterns reflective of the extensive and poor  metabolizer phenotypes for CYP2D6, the cytochrome P450 isoform responsible for DM  metabolism. In the patient who appeared to represent the extensive metabolizer (EM)  phenotype, treatment with the non-specific cytochrome P450 inhibitor cimetidine was  required to reduce biotransformation of DM to DX and, thus, to increase DM plasma  concentrations. In the patient with the apparent poor metabolizer (PM) phenotype, a  change in the DM preparation to a sustained-release form and increase in the dosing  interval was required to lower DM plasma concentrations. These cases demonstrate the  importance of CYP2D6 phenotype in providing safe and effective DM therapy to  patients with NKH.",

        "Abstract": "Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) is a rare and slowly progressing  neurodegenerative disease characterized by the presence of eosinophilic intranuclear  inclusions in the nervous system and multiple visceral organs. Sporadic NIID case  was more frequently encountered than familial. In our study, we reported two  adult-onset NIID patients from a family and described their clinical, imaging, and  pathological features. The first patient was a 61-year-old man who only presented  with non-specific headache and dizziness; however, Brain MRI with diffusion-weighted  images (DWI) sequence showed high-intensity signal involving a small regional  portion of corticomedullary junction in the frontal and parietal lobe. The older  sister of former, a 64-year-old female, who developed sudden onset of weakness of  the right limb was admitted to our neurology department. Compared with the first  patient, similar DWI high-intensity signal but more extensive area in the  corticomedullary junction was found in her brain MRI examination, also prominent  leukoencephalopathy in T2-weighted image. Significantly, skin pathology of the first  patient showed that typical inclusions with strongly positive P62 and ubiquitin  antibody could be seen in the nuclei of sweat gland cells, adipocytes, and  fibroblasts. FMR1 gene was negative. Although rare, adult-onset NIID should be  considered when the characteristic radiology changes of high intensity signal  involving the corticomedullary junction in the brain DWI sequence was found. In  addition, the pathological result of skin biopsy combined with negative genetic  testing FMR1 or NOTCH2NLC can contribute to the accurate diagnosis of the disease.  This article aims to improve the radiologists' knowledge of NIID by our cases  presentation and reviewing literature.",

        "Abstract": "We report on eight children with severe diarrhea beginning in the first 6 months of  life (< 1 month in six cases), who had a number of features in common. All were  small for gestational age and had an abnormal phenotype, including facial  dysmorphism, hypertelorism, and woolly, easily removable hair with trichorhexis  nodosa. Two were products of consanguineous marriages. Severe secretory diarrhea  persisted despite bowel rest (n = 7). Jejunal biopsy specimens showed total or  subtotal villous atrophy with crypt necrosis, and inconstant T-cell activation in  some cases (n = 3). Colon biopsy specimens showed moderate nonspecific colitis. All  the patients had defective antibody responses despite normal serum immunoglobulin  levels, and defective antigen-specific skin tests despite positive proliferative  responses in vitro. Three had monoclonal hyper-immunoglobulinemia A. The course was  marked by diffuse erythroderma in two cases and mental retardation in three.  Treatment included bowel rest, intravenous administration of immune globulins,  administration of corticosteroids (n = 6) and cyclosporine (n = 2), and bone marrow  transplantation (n = 1). Five patients died between the ages of 2 and 5 years (of  sepsis or cirrhosis), two are being fed enterally, and one continues to receive  total parenteral nutrition. The cause of the combined low birth weight, dysmorphism,  severe diarrhea, trichorrhexis, and immunodeficiency is unclear. These features may  constitute a specific syndrome within the group of intractable diarrheas of infancy.",

        "Abstract": "Spinal epidural abscesses are rare, accounting for only 0.2-1.2 of every 10,000  hospital admissions. Because they often present with non-specific symptoms, they are  frequently misdiagnosed. We present a case in which superconduction MRI was used to  make the diagnosis and to follow the clinical course of a spinal epidural abscess.  In December 1988, a 33-year-old male developed spiking fever and the sudden onset of  torticollis. He had had a cerebral palsy from birth, with chronic tetraparesis and  mental retardation. Isolation of staphylococcus aureus in urine and blood cultures  confirmed the diagnosis of pyelonephritis and septicemia. A high fever persisted  despite antibiotic therapy commenced immediately. A technetium 99 m scan showed a  localized uptake of isotope in the cervical spine. An MRI examination performed in  the following day under sedation showed a mass with the same signal intensity as  muscle on T1-weighted images. It was located behind the vertebral bodies C1-Th1  compressing the spinal cord. In addition, a lesion with a decreased signal was also  evident in the C5-C6 vertebral bodies. Because of torticollis, the patient was  unable to keep his head still for a sufficient period of time, to obtain T2-weighted  imaging. The MRI findings indicated the presence of a spinal epidural abscess and  osteomyelitis. A second MRI done one month after admission showed a reduction in the  size of the epidural mass, but further diminishing of the signal intensity of the  vertebral lesion. One month later, the patient underwent the surgical removal of the  pus and inflammatory soft tissue, and anterior fusion. The torticollis resolved  following the operation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "Title": "Phytobezoar: A train can hide another.",
        "Abstract": "INTRODUCTION AND IMPORTANCE: Acute bowel obstruction is a life-threatening  condition; late or incomplete management worsens the prognosis. Bezoars are a rare  etiology of this disease, and the diagnosis can be confusing. This study aims to  present and discuss a very rare case of concomitant bezoars. CASE PRESENTATION: We  report the case of a 22-year-old male with a history of mental retardation who was  admitted to the emergency department for acute intestinal obstruction with diffuse  abdominal guarding. Laboratory findings revealed a biological inflammatory syndrome  and an electrolyte imbalance. The abdominal X-ray was without abnormalities.  Intraoperatively, a phytobezoar in the jejunum was initially discovered. However,  the entire digestive tract's meticulous exploration discovered a concomitant  vegetable bezoar in the stomach. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: Phytobezoar obstruction is  very rare and usually located in the distal small bowel, related to the reduced  intraluminal diameter, the decreased mobility, and the higher water absorption in  this portion. The clinical presentation is non-specific and reflects acute  intestinal obstruction in the majority of cases. The abdominal CT-scan is useful for  diagnosis. However, Surgeons should not delay the intervention until they recognize  the etiology preoperatively because it is not always obvious. Besides, surgeons  should explore the entire gastrointestinal tract during the intervention; a second  phytobezoars' location is undoubtedly exceptional but exists, as evidenced by our  case. CONCLUSION: When phytobezoar obstruction, urgent care is required, and the  intraoperative exploration of the entire digestive tract is a simple gesture with  capital importance. It allows to prevent avoidable complications, especially a  second surgery.",

METHODS: This retrospective study was carried  out between January 1994 and August 2011 on children with delayed development, gait  disorders and motor handicaps, with signs of symmetrical pyramidal tract  involvement. A detailed perinatal and family history, including the age of onset of  symptoms, was recorded. The children were labelled as having either the pure or  complicated form of HSP based on the established diagnostic criteria. In families  with more than one affected child, parents and all other siblings were also  examined. RESULTS: Within the study, 74 children from 31 families were diagnosed  with HSP. Parental consanguinity was seen in 91% of cases, with 44 children (59.4%)  experiencing onset of the disease under one year of age. Complicated HSP was the  most common type, seen in 81.1%. Speech involvement, mental retardation, and  epilepsy were the most common associated abnormalities. Nonspecific white matter  changes and corpus callosum abnormalities were noted in 24.3% of cases on magnetic  resonance imaging. CONCLUSION: The study described clinical features of 74 children  with HSP. Autosomal recessive complicated HSP was seen in 81.1% of cases.",

RESULTS: Twelve cases fulfilled  criteria of typical AHC and 5 were atypical. Mean age at diagnosis was 26 months and  47% cases had a family history of migraine. Mean age at onset of hemiplegic attacks  was 9.3 months. Symptoms disappeared during sleep and precipitating factors were  present in 94% cases. Most patients developed mental retardation with ataxia and  dysarthria. Work-up tests (metabolic, neurophysiologic and radiologic) were normal  or nonspecific. In 3 patients mutations in CACNA1A, ATP1A2 were ruled out. Positive  responses to flunarizine was observed in 81%. CONCLUSIONS: The characteristic  clinical symptoms are still the clue to make the diagnosis of this disease, with a  lack of genetic, biochemical or radiological specific studies. Early diagnosis  avoids invasive tests, repeating procedures, using ineffective and potentially toxic  treatments, and allows to start treatment with flunarizine without delay. More  genetic studies are needed in broader series of patients.",

        "Title": "Toxoplasmosis in pregnancy.",
        "Abstract": "Primary infection with Toxoplasma gondii in pregnant women occurs all over the world  with frequencies between 0.1-1%. In approximately 40% of the cases, the unborn child  is infected. The risk of fetal infection increases during pregnancy, while at the  same time the risk of severe disease decreases. As a result, infants with congenital  toxoplasmosis are mostly asymptomatic at birth, but long-term studies indicate that  up to 85% of them will develop sequelae including chorioretinitis (leading to severe  impairment of vision), hearing loss or mental retardation. Early recognition of  maternal infection and treatment with spiramycin or pyrimethamine-sulphadiazine will  reduce the parasitic colonization of the placenta by more than 60% and prevent  infection in the fetus. If fetal infection has already occurred, maternal treatment  modifies the fetal disease. Therapy during the first year of life improves the  prognosis. It is possible today to identify infected fetuses by prenatal diagnosis  based on detection of the parasite in cord blood, amniotic fluid and placental  tissue. Specific antibodies and non-specific signs of infection in fetal blood give  additional information. Advances in laboratory techniques have made it feasible to  consider serological surveillance of pregnant women. The present recommendation is  that each country should provide data on the incidence of toxoplasma infection in  pregnancy and thereby decide whether it represents a problem and what measures  should be adopted. This paper summarizes the present knowledge of the parasite and  its implication for the mother and unborn child. The effect and problems of primary  and secondary prevention in pregnancy are discussed as well as the efficacy of  treatment. The need for future research including long-term follow-up studies are  emphasized.",

        "Title": "GRIN1 mutations cause encephalopathy with infantile-onset epilepsy, and hyperkinetic  and stereotyped movement disorders.",
        "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Recently, de novo mutations in GRIN1 have been identified in patients  with nonsyndromic intellectual disability and epileptic encephalopathy. Whole exome  sequencing (WES) analysis of patients with genetically unsolved epileptic  encephalopathies identified four patients with GRIN1 mutations, allowing us to  investigate the phenotypic spectrum of GRIN1 mutations. METHODS: Eighty-eight  patients with unclassified early onset epileptic encephalopathies (EOEEs) with an  age of onset <1 year were analyzed by WES. The effect of mutations on  N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors was examined by mapping altered amino acids  onto three-dimensional models. RESULTS: We identified four de novo missense GRIN1  mutations in 4 of 88 patients with unclassified EOEEs. In these four patients,  initial symptoms appeared within 3 months of birth, including hyperkinetic movements  in two patients (2/4, 50%), and seizures in two patients (2/4, 50%). Involuntary  movements, severe developmental delay, and intellectual disability were recognized  in all four patients. In addition, abnormal eye movements resembling oculogyric  crises and stereotypic hand movements were observed in two and three patients,  respectively. All the four patients exhibited only nonspecific focal and diffuse  epileptiform abnormality, and never showed suppression-burst or hypsarrhythmia  during infancy. A de novo mosaic mutation (c.1923G>A) with a mutant allele frequency  of 16% (in DNA of blood leukocytes) was detected in one patient. Three mutations  were located in the transmembrane domain (3/4, 75%), and one in the extracellular  loop near transmembrane helix 1. All the mutations were predicted to impair the  function of the NMDA receptor. SIGNIFICANCE: Clinical features of de novo GRIN1  mutations include infantile involuntary movements, seizures, and hand stereotypies,  suggesting that GRIN1 mutations cause encephalopathy resulting in seizures and  movement disorders.",

        "Title": "Utility of whole exome sequencing for the early diagnosis of pediatric-onset  cerebellar atrophy associated with developmental delay in an inbred population.",
        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cerebellar atrophy and developmental delay are commonly associated  features in large numbers of genetic diseases that frequently also include epilepsy.  These defects are highly heterogeneous on both the genetic and clinical levels.  Patients with these signs also typically present with non-specific neuroimaging  results that can help prioritize further investigation but don't suggest a specific  molecular diagnosis. METHODS: To genetically explore a cohort of 18 Egyptian  families with undiagnosed cerebellar atrophy identified on MRI, we sequenced  probands and some non-affected family members via high-coverage whole exome  sequencing (WES; >97\u00a0% of the exome covered at least by 30x). Patients were mostly  from consanguineous families, either sporadic or multiplex. We analyzed WES data and  filtered variants according to dominant and recessive inheritance models. RESULTS:  We successfully identified disease-causing mutations in half of the families  screened (9/18). These mutations are located in seven different genes, PLA2G6 being  the gene most frequently mutated (n\u2009=\u20093). We also identified a recurrent de novo  mutation in the KIF1A gene and a molybdenum cofactor deficiency caused by the loss  of the start codon in the MOCS2A open-reading frame in a mildly affected subject.  CONCLUSIONS: This study illustrates the necessity of screening for dominant  mutations in WES data from consanguineous families. Our identification of a patient  with a mild and improving phenotype carrying a previously characterized severe loss  of function mutation also broadens the clinical spectrum associated with molybdenum  cofactor deficiency.",

        "Title": "GLUT1 deficiency syndrome: an update.",
        "Abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Glucose transporter type 1 deficiency syndrome is caused by  heterozygous, mostly de novo, mutations in the SLC2A1 gene encoding the glucose  transporter GLUT1. Mutations in this gene limit brain glucose availability and lead  to cerebral energy deficiency. STATE OF THE ART: The phenotype is characterized by  the variable association of mental retardation, acquired microcephaly, complex motor  disorders, and paroxysmal manifestations including seizures and non-epileptic  paroxysmal episodes. Clinical severity varies from mild motor dysfunction to severe  neurological disability. In patients with mild phenotypes, paroxysmal manifestations  may be the sole manifestations of the disease. In particular, the diagnosis should  be considered in patients with paroxysmal exercise-induced dyskinesia or with  early-onset generalized epilepsy. Low CSF level of glucose, relative to blood level,  is the best biochemical clue to the diagnosis although not constantly found.  Molecular analysis of the SLC2A1 gene confirms the diagnosis. Ketogenic diet is the  cornerstone of the treatment and implicates a close monitoring by a  multidisciplinary team including trained dieticians. Non-specific drugs may be used  as add-on symptomatic treatments but their effects are often disappointing.  CONCLUSION: Glucose transporter type 1 deficiency syndrome is likely under diagnosed  due to its complex and pleiotropic phenotype. Proper identification of the affected  patients is important for clinical practice since the disease is treatable.",

        "Abstract": "Neuronal ceroid-lipofuscinosis is the most common class of neurodegenerative disease  in children. After decades of study, the biochemical basis for this group of  diseases continues to elude scientists. One obstacle has been the difficulty in  establishing specific criteria for diagnosis. This paper reviews case material from  65 patients referred to the Shriver Center for study from January, 1984 to December,  1986. The late-infantile type was the most commonly encountered (35%) with a mean  age-of-onset of 3.1 +/- 0.5 yr. The juvenile type was slightly less frequent (32%)  with a mean age-of-onset of 7.8 +/- 4 yr. The infantile type ranked third (23%);  age-of-onset 11 +/- 4 months) and the adult form of the disease was the least common  (10%; age-of-onset 25 +/- 4 yr). Consistent clinical findings were a progressive  decline in mental faculties and seizures, predominantly of the myoclonic type.  Neuroradiological changes of cerebral and cerebellar cortical atrophy were common  when studies were obtained more than a year after clinical onset. Ataxia was a  frequent manifestation in the late-infantile and juvenile types whereas dystonia was  unique to the latter. There was a diversity of ultrastructural findings in skin  biopsies between and within types. The absence of findings in a few familial cases  necessitated sampling a second tissue such as muscle, particularly when the history  was suggestive and urine dolichols were high. Elevated urine dolichol levels was a  nonspecific but helpful finding.",

        "Abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To determine the demands on healthcare resources caused by different  types of illnesses and variation with age and sex. DESIGN: Information on healthcare  use was obtained from all 22 healthcare sectors in the Netherlands. Most important  sectors (hospitals, nursing homes, inpatient psychiatric care, institutions for  mentally disabled people) have national registries. Total expenditures for each  sector were subdivided into 21 age groups, sex, and 34 diagnostic groups. SETTING:  Netherlands, 1994. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Proportion of healthcare budget spent on  each category of disease and cost of health care per person at various ages.  RESULTS: After the first year of life, costs per person for children were lowest.  Costs rose slowly throughout adult life and increased exponentially from age 50  onwards till the oldest age group (> or = 95). The top five areas of healthcare  costs were mental retardation, musculoskeletal disease (predominantly joint disease  and dorsopathy), dementia, a heterogeneous group of other mental disorders, and ill  defined conditions. Stroke, all cancers combined, and coronary heart disease ranked  7, 8, and 10, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The main determinants of healthcare use in  the Netherlands are old age and disabling conditions, particularly mental  disability. A large share of the healthcare budget is spent on long term nursing  care, and this cost will inevitably increase further in an ageing population.  Non-specific cost containment measures may endanger the quality of care for old and  mentally disabled people.",

        "Title": "Prevalence and risk of violence against adults with disabilities: a systematic  review and meta-analysis of observational studies.",
        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: About 15% of adults worldwide have a disability. These individuals are  frequently reported to be at increased risk of violence, yet quantitative syntheses  of studies of this issue are scarce. We aimed to quantify violence against adults  with disabilities. METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched  12 electronic databases to identify primary research studies published between Jan  1, 1990, and Aug 17, 2010, reporting prevalence estimates of violence against adults  (aged mainly \u226518 years) with disabilities, or their risk of violence compared with  non-disabled adults. We included only studies reporting violence occurring within  the 12 months before the study. We assessed studies with six core quality criteria,  and pooled data for analysis. FINDINGS: Of 10,663 references initially identified,  26 were eligible for inclusion, with data for 21,557 individuals with disabilities.  21 studies provided data suitable for meta-analysis of prevalence of violence, and  ten for meta-analysis of risks of violence. Pooled prevalence of any (physical,  sexual, or intimate partner) recent violence was 24\u00b73% (95% CI 18\u00b73-31\u00b70) in people  with mental illnesses, 6\u00b71% (2\u00b75-11\u00b71) in those with intellectual impairments, and  3\u00b72% (2\u00b75-4\u00b71) in those with non-specific impairments. We identified substantial  heterogeneity in most prevalence estimates (I(2) >75%). We noted large uncertainty  around pooled risk estimates. Pooled crude odds ratios for the risk of violence in  disabled compared with non-disabled individuals were 1\u00b750 (95% CI 1\u00b709-2\u00b705) for all  studies combined, 1\u00b731 (0\u00b793-1\u00b784) for people with non-specific impairments, 1\u00b760  (1\u00b705-2\u00b745) for people with intellectual impairments, and 3\u00b786 (0\u00b791-16\u00b743) for  those with mental illnesses. INTERPRETATION: Adults with disabilities are at a  higher risk of violence than are non-disabled adults, and those with mental  illnesses could be particularly vulnerable. However, available studies have  methodological weaknesses and gaps exist in the types of disability and violence  they address. Robust studies are absent for most regions of the world, particularly  low-income and middle-income countries. FUNDING: WHO Department of Violence and  Injury Prevention and Disability.",

        "Abstract": "Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of bile  acid synthesis caused by mutations in the cytochrome P450 CYP27A1 gene that result  in production of a defective sterol 27-hydroxylase enzyme. CTX is associated with  abnormally high levels of cholestanol in the blood and accumulation of cholestanol  and cholesterol in the brain, tendon xanthomas, and bile. Hallmark clinical  manifestations of CTX include chronic diarrhea, bilateral cataracts, tendon  xanthomas, and neurologic dysfunction. Although CTX is a rare disorder, it is  thought to be underdiagnosed, as presenting signs and symptoms may be nonspecific  with significant overlap with other more common conditions. There is marked  variability in signs and symptoms, severity, and age of onset between patients. The  disease course is progressive and potentially debilitating or fatal, particularly  with respect to neurologic presentations that can include intellectual disability,  autism, behavioral and psychiatric problems, and dementia, among others. Treatment  with chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA; chenodiol) is the current standard of care. CDCA  can help restore normal sterol, bile acid, bile alcohol, and cholestanol levels.  CDCA also appears to be generally effective in preventing adverse clinical  manifestations of the disease from occurring or progressing if administered early  enough. Improved screening and awareness of the condition may help facilitate early  diagnosis and treatment.",

Besides common clinical features, non-specific or more  subtle clinical symptoms may be present in association with different types of MCD.  Especially in severely affected individuals, subtle but specific underlying clinical  symptoms can be overlooked or overshadowed by the global clinical presentation. To  facilitate the interpretation of genetic variants detailed clinical information is  indispensable. Detailed (neurological) examination can be helpful in assisting with  the diagnostic trajectory, both when referring for genetic work-up as well as when  interpreting data from molecular genetic testing. This systematic literature review  focusses on different clues derived from the neurological examination and potential  further work-up triggered by these signs and symptoms in genetically defined MCDs. A  concise overview of specific neurological findings and their associations with MCD  subtype and genotype are presented, easily applicable in daily clinical practice.  The following pathologies will be discussed: neuropathy, myopathy, muscular  dystrophies and spastic paraplegia.

        "Title": "Genetics of bipolar disorder.",
        "Abstract": "Bipolar disorder is a common, complex genetic disorder, but the mode of transmission  remains to be discovered. Many researchers assume that common genomic variants carry  some risk for manifesting the disease. The research community has celebrated the  first genome-wide significant associations between common single nucleotide  polymorphisms (SNPs) and bipolar disorder. Currently, attempts are under way to  translate these findings into clinical practice, genetic counseling, and predictive  testing. However, some experts remain cautious. After all, common variants explain  only a very small percentage of the genetic risk, and functional consequences of the  discovered SNPs are inconclusive. Furthermore, the associated SNPs are not disease  specific, and the majority of individuals with a \"risk\" allele are healthy. On the  other hand, population-based genome-wide studies in psychiatric disorders have  rediscovered rare structural variants and mutations in genes, which were previously  known to cause genetic syndromes and monogenic Mendelian disorders. In many  Mendelian syndromes, psychiatric symptoms are prevalent. Although these conditions  do not fit the classic description of any specific psychiatric disorder, they often  show nonspecific psychiatric symptoms that cross diagnostic boundaries, including  intellectual disability, behavioral abnormalities, mood disorders, anxiety  disorders, attention deficit, impulse control deficit, and psychosis. Although  testing for chromosomal disorders and monogenic Mendelian disorders is well  established, testing for common variants is still controversial. The standard  concept of genetic testing includes at least three broad criteria that need to be  fulfilled before new genetic tests should be introduced: analytical validity,  clinical validity, and clinical utility. These criteria are currently not fulfilled  for common genomic variants in psychiatric disorders. Further work is clearly needed  before genetic testing for common variants in psychiatric disorders should be  established.",

        "Abstract": "Medical interest in cytomegalovirus (CMV) is based on lifelong neurological  sequelae, such as sensorineural hearing loss and mental retardation, resulting from  congenital infection of the fetus in utero, as well as on CMV disease with multiple  organ manifestations and graft loss in recipients of hematopoietic cell  transplantation or solid organ transplantation. CMV infection of transplantation  recipients occurs consequent to reactivation of virus harbored in a latent state in  the transplanted donor cells and tissues, or in the tissues of the transplantation  recipient herself or himself. Hence, CMV infection is a paradigm for a viral  infection that causes disease primarily in the immunocompromised host, while  infection of the immunocompetent host is associated with only mild and nonspecific  symptoms so that it usually goes unnoticed. Thus, CMV is kept under strict immune  surveillance. These medical facts are in apparent conflict with the notion that CMVs  in general, human CMV as well as animal CMVs, are masters of 'immune evasion', which  during virus-host co-speciation have convergently evolved sophisticated mechanisms  to avoid their recognition by innate and adaptive immunity of their respective host  species, with viral genes apparently dedicated to serve just this purpose (Reddehase  in Nat Rev Immunol 2:831-844, 2002). With focus on viral interference with antigen  presentation to CD8 T cells in the preclinical model of murine CMV infection, we try  here to shed some more light on the in vivo balance between host immune surveillance  of CMV infection and viral 'immune evasion' strategies.",

        "Abstract": "The view that lysosomes simply represent end organelles in the serial degradation of  polymeric molecules derived from the cell surface and its interior has led to major  misconceptions about the nature of lysosomal storage diseases and the pathogenic  cascades that characterize them. Accordingly, lysosomal storage bodies are often  considered 'inert', inducing cell dysfunction and death primarily through mechanical  overcrowding of normal organelles or by other non-specific means leading to  generalized cytotoxicity. However, modern studies of lysosomes and their component  proteins provide evidence to support a far greater role for these organelles in cell  metabolism. In intimate association with endosomal, autophagosomal and related  vesicular systems, the greater lysosomal system can be conceptualized as a vital  recycling centre that serves as a central metabolic coordinator, influencing  literally every aspect of the cell, from signal transduction to regulation of gene  expression. CONCLUSION: This broader view of the role of lysosomes in cells not only  provides insight into how single gene defects impacting on lysosomal function can  result in the plethora of complex cellular transformations characteristic of these  diseases, but also suggests new and innovative therapies that may hold considerable  promise for ameliorating disease progression.",

        "Abstract": "Ring chromosome 15 [r(15)] syndrome is characterised by specific facial features,  caf\u00e9 au lait spots, failure to thrive, mental retardation and typically with a  terminal deletion of the long arm of chromosome 15. We report a 2.5 year old girl  showing normal growth and development, large hyperpigmented skin changes showing  hypopigmentated areas inside, multiple caf\u00e9 au lait spots and premature graying-like  hypopigmentation of scalp hair. She had a karyotype of r(15) in peripheral  lymphocytes and fibroblasts. By FISH analysis the breakpoint was located distal to  locus D15S936 (15q26.3) and within 300 kb of the end of the chromosome, indicating  no deletion of functional genes on 15q. Hyperpigmentation and caf\u00e9 au lait spots are  rare signs in ring chromosome syndromes, but with r(15) syndrome, caf\u00e9 au lait spots  have been described in about 30% of patients and have been considered to result from  the deletion of gene(s) on distal 15q. Based on the frequent observation of patchy  hyperpigmentation with the r(15) syndrome, absent hyperpigmentation in cases of  distal 15q deletion without a ring chromosome, and the telomeric breakpoint location  in our patient indicating no significant deletion, we propose that the cutaneous  hyperpigmentation and caf\u00e9 au lait spots in our proband represent effects of the  r(15) chromosome but are not caused by the deletion of specific gene(s) on distal  15q. Patchy skin hypopigmentation is a well known nonspecific sign in cytogenetic  mosaicism which is commonly seen in ring syndrome.",

The  potential of T cells to cause myelin pathology was determined by measuring the  activity of the myelin-associated enzyme 2'-3'-cyclic nucleotide  3'-phosphodiesterase (CNPase) in organotypic cultures of syngeneic spinal cord after  incubation with the T cell lines. The activity of CNPase in neural tissue has been  shown to correlate positively with the amount and integrity of CNS myelin. Although  both MBP- and PPD-specific T cells caused decreases in CNPase activity, the MBP line  caused significantly greater and consistent changes. This finding indicates that T  cell-mediated CNS demyelination may be comprised of CNS antigen-specific and CNS  non-specific components, the former causing more pathology.",

        "Abstract": "The interaction of native and cationized bovine serum albumin-gold complex with  confluent monolayers of goat [corrected] brain microvascular endothelial cells was  investigated. These cells were used as an in vitro model of the blood-brain barrier.  After exposure to both complexes for 5, 15, 30, and 60 min, the endothelial cells  were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed, and processed for electron  microscopy. The results obtained suggest that (a) contrary to previous observations  in vivo, cultured endothelial cells were able to transfer native bovine serum  albumin-gold complex particles from apical to basolateral surfaces presumably via a  fluid-phase mechanism; (b) the most conspicuous difference in the interaction of  both albumin-gold complexes consisted in a significantly greater adsorption of  cationized than of native bovine serum albumin-gold complex to the apical surface of  the endothelial cells; (c) the further fate of the endocytosed complexes was  similar, that is, their major part was internalized into endosomes, multivesicular  bodies and lysosomes whereas a smaller fraction was apparently transferred to the  basolateral plasma membrane where presumably they were exocytosed into the  subendothelial space. These observations provide new ultrastructural evidence that  both native and cationized albumin are endocytosed and eventually transported by a  non-specific, fluid-phase mechanism, and also support the results of earlier  quantitative studies indicating the absence of albumin receptors in brain  endothelia.",

Molecular  genetic analysis demonstrated two mutations in exon 1 of the AQP2 gene: C to T  transition, which resulted in a missense mutation of (108)Thr (ACG) to Met (ATG);  and a 127, 128 delCA, which resulted in a deletion mutation of glutamine in position  43 at codon CAG as the first affected amino acid, with the new reading frame endign  in a termination codon at position 62. The molecular genetic analysis of the parents  showed that the missense mutation was inherited maternally and the deletion mutation  was inherited paternally. The parents showed no signs or symptoms of CNDI,  indicating autosomal recessive inheritance. The (108)Thr (ACG) to Met (ATG) mutation  was confirmed as a novel mutation. Therefore, the molecular identification of the  AQP2 gene has clinical significance, as early recognition of CNDI in infants that  show only non-specific symptoms, can be facilitated. Thus, repeated episodes of  dehydration, which may cause physical and mental retardation can be avoided.",

        "Title": "Multiple independent spike foci and epilepsy, with special reference to a new  epileptic syndrome of \"severe epilepsy with multiple independent spike foci\".",
        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Markand and Blume first realized the specificity of the EEG pattern of  multiple independent spike foci (MISF) in the late 1970s; its close relation with  hypsarrhythmia and slow spike-waves, extensive bilateral brain lesion, and  intractable seizures. But they did not recognize it as an epileptic syndrome. On the  other hand, the authors had been taken notice of severe epilepsy with MISF (SE-MISF)  as a peculiar clinico-electrical entity showing \"generalized seizures\", and pointed  out its close relation to Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) from the long-term follow-up  of LGS. SUMMARY POINTS: SE-MISF is characterized by (1) interictal EEG showing  multiple independent spike foci (three or more foci in both hemisphere, i.e. at  least one in each hemisphere) and diffuse slowing of the background activity.  Diffuse epileptic discharges are rare. (2) The main seizure type is frequent  generalized minor seizures, often tonic spasms. (3) Mutual transition is often  observed between the age-dependent epileptic encephalopathies, i.e. Ohtahara  syndrome, West syndrome and LGS. (4) The age at epilepsy onset is early, but the  onset of SE-MISF is variable. (5) It is often associated with mental retardation and  neurological abnormalities, usually severe. (6) Etiology is variable and largely  nonspecific, including prenatal, perinatal, and postnatal cerebral pathologies. (7)  Prognoses for seizures and psychomotor development are poor. Seizures are very  intractable and may cause psychomotor deterioration. CONCLUSION: SE-MISF may be  classified into symptomatic generalized epilepsy, namely a diffuse encephalopathy  with mutual transition between other age-dependent epileptic encephalopathies. This  characteristic entity may be acknowledged as a new epileptic syndrome.",

Non-specific  measures, such as improved housing, better nutrition and higher standards of  education, have also contributed to the reduction in serious illnesses that can  potentially cause disabilities. Second level prevention, designed to limit or  reverse a disability, has included a developmental screening programme carried out  in the primary health care sector. Centralised multi-disciplinary developmental  assessment clinics have been established to define better the disabilities and to  advise on rehabilitation. An early intervention programme has been started, and  special schools are being upgraded. Third level prevention, aimed at preventing a  disability from becoming a handicap, has included the setting up of comprehensive  rehabilitation programmes, provision of aids and appliances, vocational training,  and job opportunities.

        "Abstract": "Cerebral palsy (CP) is a non-progressive neurodevelopmental disorder characterized  by motor impairments, often accompanied by co-morbidities such as intellectual  disability, epilepsy, visual and hearing impairment and speech and language  deficits. Despite the established role of hypoxic-ischemic injury in some CP cases,  several studies suggest that birth asphyxia is actually an uncommon cause,  accounting for <10% of CP cases. For children with CP in the absence of traditional  risk factors, a genetic basis to their condition is increasingly suspected. Several  recent studies indeed confirm copy number variants and single gene mutations with  large genetic heterogeneity as an etiology in children with CP. Here, we report  three patients with spastic cerebral palsy and a genetically confirmed diagnosis of  Aicardi-Gouti\u00e8res syndrome (AGS), with highly variable phenotypes ranging from  clinically suggestive to non-specific symptomatology. Our findings suggest that AGS  may be a rather common cause of CP, that frequently remains undiagnosed without  additional genetic testing, as in only one case a clinical suspicion of AGS was  raised. Our data show that a diagnosis of AGS must be considered in cases with  spastic CP, even in the absence of characteristic brain abnormalities. Importantly,  a genetic diagnosis of AGS may have significant therapeutic consequences, as  targeted therapies are being developed for type 1 interferonopathies, the group of  diseases to which AGS belongs. Our findings demonstrate the importance of next  generation sequencing in CP patients without an identifiable cause, since targeted  diagnostic testing is hampered by the often non-specific presentation.",

        "Title": "Spatial learning deficits induced by muscimol and CL218,872: lack of effect of  prenatal malnutrition.",
        "Abstract": "The sensitivity of prenatal protein malnourished rats to the amnestic properties of  the direct GABAA receptor agonist muscimol and the selective benzodiazepine (BZ)  receptor agonist, CL218,872, was studied in the male offspring of rats provided with  a protein deficient diet (6% casein) for 5 weeks prior to mating and throughout  pregnancy. At postnatal day 90, rats were tested during acquisition of the submerged  platform version of the Morris water maze task using four systemic doses of muscimol  (0.1, 0.3, 1.0 and 1.8 mg/kg i.p.) or three systemic doses of CL218,872 (1.0, 3.2,  and 5.6 mg/kg i.p.). In a dose dependent manner both drugs impaired acquisition of  the task and impaired accuracy of the search pattern on the probe trial (platform  removed). However, neither drug dissociated the performance of the two nutritional  groups. These data are important in light of previous findings of differential  behavioral effects of the non-specific BZ agonist, chlordiazepoxide (CDP), on  spatial learning and on drug discrimination in prenatally malnourished rats and in  the context of previous findings of reduced sensitivity to the anxiolytic effects of  non-specific BZ receptor agonists across a wide variety of models of malnutrition.  The present findings also support the concept that prenatal malnutrition does not  affect the global functioning of the GABAA receptor, but fundamentally alters the  way in which a subset of GABAA receptors (i.e. those containing the alpha2, alpha3  and/or the alpha5 but not the alpha1 subunit) is modulated by BZs.",

The underlying mechanisms of their  poor reading remain uncertain. The aim of this study was to investigate the  concurrent predictors of decoding ability in 136 adolescents with non-specific ID,  and to evaluate the results in relation to previous findings on typical readers. The  study included a broad range of cognitive and language measures as predictors of  decoding ability. A LASSO regression analysis identified phonological awareness and  rapid automatized naming (RAN) as the most important predictors. The predictors  explained 57.73% of the variance in decoding abilities. These variables are similar  to the ones found in earlier research on typically developing children, hence  supporting our hypothesis of a delayed rather than a different reading profile.  These results lend some support to the use of interventions and reading  instructions, originally developed for typically developing children, for children  and adolescents with non-specific ID.",

        "Title": "Clinical Characteristics and Genotype-Phenotype Correlation in Children with KMT2E  Gene-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorders: Report of Two New Cases and Review of  Published Literature.",
        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: In recent years, many new candidate genes are being identified as  putative pathogenic factors in children with developmental delay and autism.  Recently, heterozygous mutations in the KMT2E gene have been identified as a cause  of a unique neurodevelopmental disorder with variable combination of global  developmental delay or isolated speech delay, intellectual disability, autistic  features, and seizures. METHODS: Here, we present two new cases of KMT2E  mutation-associated neurodevelopmental disorder in a 4-year-old girl and 5-year-old  boy. We also performed a pooled review of the previously published cases of  KMT2E-related neurodevelopmental disorder. Articles were identified through search  engines using appropriate search terms. RESULTS: Along with the presented 2 cases,  40 cases were analyzed. Out of them, 30, 6, and 4 children had protein-truncating  mutations, missense mutations, and copy number variants, respectively. The common  features were global developmental delay (97%) followed by macrocephaly (35%),  seizures (30%), and autism (25%). Children with missense variants had severe  phenotype, with microcephaly, profound developmental delay, and increased frequency  of seizures. Neuroimaging revealed nonspecific changes, including cerebral white  matter signal abnormalities. CONCLUSION: KMT2E-related neurodevelopmental disorder  remains one of the clinical differentials in children with global developmental  delay and/or autistic features/seizure. With the reporting of more cases in the  future, the already heterogeneous clinical spectrum of this disease is likely to be  widened.",

        "Abstract": "Noonan syndrome (NS) is a genetic disorder caused by autosomal dominant inheritance  and is characterized by a distinctive facial appearance, short stature, chest  deformity, and congenital heart disease. In individuals with NS, germline mutations  have been identified in several genes involved in the RAS/mitogen-activated protein  kinase signal transduction pathway. Because of its clinical and genetic  heterogeneity, the conventional diagnostic protocol with Sanger sequencing requires  a multistep approach. Therefore, molecular genetic diagnosis using targeted exome  sequencing (TES) is considered a less expensive and faster method, particularly for  patients who do not fulfill the clinical diagnostic criteria of NS. In this case,  the patient showed short stature, dysmorphic facial features suggestive of NS,  feeding intolerance, cryptorchidism, and intellectual disability in early childhood.  At the age of 16, the patient still showed extreme short stature with delayed  puberty and characteristic facial features suggestive of NS. Although the patient  had no cardiac problems or chest wall deformities, which are commonly present in NS  and are major concerns for patients and clinicians, the patient showed several other  characteristic clinical features of NS. Considering the possibility of a genetic  disorder, including NS, a molecular genetic study with TES was performed. With TES  analysis, we detected a pathogenic variant of c.458A > T in KRAS in this patient  with atypical NS phenotype and provided appropriate clinical management and genetic  counseling. The application of TES enables accurate molecular diagnosis of patients  with nonspecific or atypical features in genetic diseases with several responsible  genes, such as NS.",

        "Title": "Diagnostic utility of whole exome sequencing in patients showing cerebellar and/or  vermis atrophy in childhood.",
        "Abstract": "Cerebellar and/or vermis atrophy is recognized in various types of childhood  disorders with clinical and genetic heterogeneity. Although careful evaluation of  clinical features and neuroimaging can lead to correct diagnosis of disorders, their  diagnosis is sometimes difficult because clinical features can overlap with each  other. In this study, we performed family-based whole exome sequencing of 23  families including 25 patients with cerebellar and/or vermis atrophy in childhood,  who were unable to be diagnosed solely by clinical examination. Pathological  mutations of seven genes were found in ten patients from nine families (9/23,  39.1\u00a0%): compound heterozygous mutations in FOLR1, C5orf42, POLG, TPP1, PEX16, and  de novo mutations in CACNA1A, and ITPR1. Patient 1A with FOLR1 mutations showed  extremely low concentration of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate in the cerebrospinal fluid  and serum, and Patient 6 with TPP1 mutations demonstrated markedly lowered  tripeptidyl peptidase 1 activity in leukocytes. Furthermore, Patient 8 with PEX16  mutations presented a mild increase of very long chain fatty acids in the serum as  supportive data for genetic diagnosis. The main clinical features of these ten  patients were nonspecific and mixed, and included developmental delay, intellectual  disability, ataxia, hypotonia, and epilepsy. Brain MRI revealed both cerebellar and  vermis atrophy in eight patients (8/10, 80\u00a0%), vermis atrophy/hypoplasia in two  patients (2/10, 20\u00a0%), and brainstem atrophy in one patient (1/10, 10\u00a0%). Our data  clearly demonstrate the utility of whole exome sequencing for genetic diagnosis of  childhood cerebellar and/or vermis atrophy.",

        "Abstract": "Febrile infection-related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES) is a catastrophic epileptic  syndrome that strikes previously healthy children aged 3-15 years and has an unknown  pathogenesis and few treatments. These children experience a nonspecific febrile  illness that is followed by prolonged refractory status epilepticus. Although the  etiology is unknown, FIRES has a biphasic presentation, with the acute phase  beginning as seizure activity lasting 1-12 weeks, then followed by the chronic  phase, which is characterized by refractory seizures that cluster every 2-4 weeks,  and may continue to be multifocal and independent. Treatment of FIRES is difficult,  typically unresponsive to antiepileptic drugs. Some children resolve temporarily  with drug-induced burst suppression comas. Other therapies such as a ketogenic diet  have limited benefit. The outcome varies with the length of the acute phase and is  usually poor, with up to 30% of cases ending in death and 66-100% of survivors  having intellectual disability. The authors present a case of a 6-year-old child  presenting with FIRES and refractory status epilepticus, which continued despite  multidrug therapy. The patient underwent immunomodulatory therapy with the eventual  resolution of status, but she developed a chronic, moderately severe encephalopathy,  including intractable epilepsy. This case highlights the challenges of FIRES and the  potential of immunomodulatory therapies for children with this disorder.",

METHODS: Epidemiological, clinical, radiological and laboratory data were  analyzed in 35 patients. RESULTS: Simple HSP (HSP-S) was detected in 12 patients,  and complicated HSP (HSP-C) was detected in 23 patients. The mean age of onset of  symptoms was 2.9 years in HSP-S and 1.6 years in HSP-C (p = 0.023). The disease was  more severe in HSP-C. There were no differences in sex, ethnic background, or family  history between groups. Intellectual disability was the most frequent finding  associated with HSP-C. Peripheral axonal neuropathy was found in three patients. In  the HSP-C group, MRI was abnormal in 13 patients. The MRI abnormalities included  nonspecific white matter lesions, cerebellar atrophy, thinning of the corpus  callosum and the \"ear of the lynx sign\". CONCLUSIONS: In children with spastic  paraplegia, HSP must be considered whenever similar pathologies, mainly diplegic  cerebral palsy, are ruled out.",

        "Abstract": "In recent years, strategies have been developed to investigate the possible role of  chromosomal subtelomere regions in genetic disorders. The present study was to  determine the incidence of familial subtelomeric abnormalities among individuals  with developmental delay, idiopathic mental retardation, or non-specific congenital  abnormalities. A review was conducted for patients and their relatives on whom  subtelomeric DNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (telo-FISH) studies were  performed. Patients were identified through a search of the Mayo Genetics System  (MGS) database. Of 2,170 consecutive telo-FISH index case studies completed in our  laboratory between January 2002 and December 2003, 121 or 5.6% had abnormalities of  the subtelomere region. The present report includes 18 other abnormal index cases  seen prior to 2002 to yield a total of 139 abnormal index cases. This represents 71  index patients with deletions, 53 index patients with derivative chromosomes, and 15  index patients with balanced rearrangements. A familial abnormality was identified  in 29 (51.8%) of 56 families in whom parents and/or sibs were available for testing.  Among 28 patients with deletions, 9 (32%) had an inherited deletion, whereas 19  (68%) were de novo. Family members of 20 index patients with derivative chromosomes  were tested. Of these, 13 (65%) patients inherited the abnormality from a parent (12  from a parent who had a balanced translocation and 1 from a parent with the same  abnormality), while 7 (35%) apparently arose de novo. Seven (88%) of 8 with balanced  translocations inherited the translocation from one parent. The most common familial  abnormalities involved 8pter deletion or rearrangement. The incidence of familial  subtelomeric abnormalities is significantly high making parental telo-FISH studies  an essential part of the investigation of patients with subtelomeric chromosome  abnormalities.",

        "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical profile of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS)  patients and to assess the best antiepileptic drug combination. METHODS: Patient  files of all children diagnosed with LGS at King Abdul-Aziz University (KAUH),  Jeddah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia between January 2000 to January 2005 were retrieved  and analyzed. Details on clinical data, and disease related variables were  collected. Treatment trial, last drug combination, maintenance dosage, seizure  frequency, and duration before and after treatment, and the overall effect in  reducing seizures were recorded. RESULTS: Fifty-four patients were identified with a  male:female ratio of 2.4:1 with age range of 10 months to 14 years. A history of  febrile convulsion was found in 11 (20%) patients, history of infantile spasm was  found in 14 patients (26%), mental retardation in 52 patients (96%), and hypotonia  in 13 patients (24%). All patients had abnormal EEG that meets the diagnostic  criteria. Brain CT scan was abnormal in 32 (65%) patients. Brain MRI was abnormal in  17 (23%) patients. Neuroradiological abnormalities varied from non-specific atrophy  to hippocampal sclerosis and calcification. Metabolic screening carried out for 11  patients (20%) was normal. All patients were on a 3-drug combination at some stage  of their disease. The most frequent combination was sodium valproate and  lamotrigine. Intravenous immunoglobulin was used in 2 patients with temporary  improvement; ketogenic diet was tried in one patient, which did not add much to fit  control. CONCLUSION: The severe nature and intractability of LGS emphasize the need  for active and efficacious treatment, which can improve the prognosis as a whole.  Different combinations of new anticonvulsants could achieve significant seizure  control and could modify the quality of life for these patients. Each patient needs  to be considered individually, taking into account the potential benefit of each  therapy weighed against the risk of adverse effects.",

        "Abstract": "Smoking in pregnancy increases a woman's risk of preterm delivery resulting in  serious neonatal health problems and chronic lifelong disabilities for the children  (e.g., mental retardation, learning problems). To study the effects of tobacco smoke  on the placental transcriptome, we performed gene expression profiling on placentas  from women exposed to tobacco smoke in pregnancy (N = 12) and from those without  significant exposure (N = 64). Gene expression profiles were determined by Illumina  HumanRef-8 v2 Expression BeadChips with 18,216 gene probes. Microarray data were  normalized by quantile method and filtered for a detection P-value <0.01.  Differential gene expression was determined by moderated t-statistic. A linear model  was fitted for each gene given a series of arrays using lmFit function. Multiple  testing correction was performed using the Benjamini and Hochberg method. Abundant  levels of transcripts were found for genes encoding placental hormones (CSH1,  CSHL1), pregnancy-specific proteins (PSG3, PSG4, PAPPA), and hemoglobins (HBB, HBG,  HBA). Comparative analysis of smokers vs nonsmokers revealed the differential  expression of 241 genes (P < 0.05). In smoker cohort, we detected high up-regulation  of xenobiotic genes (CYP1A1, CYP1B1, CYB5A, COX412), collagen genes (e.g., COL6A3,  COL1A1, COL1A2), coagulation genes (F5, F13A1) as well as thrombosis-related genes  (CD36, ADAMTS9, GAS6). In smokers, we identified deregulated genes that show tissue  non-specific induction and may be considered as general biomarkers of tobacco smoke  exposure. Further, we also found genes specifically deregulated in the exposed  placentas. Functional annotation analysis suggested processes and pathways affected  by tobacco smoke exposure that may represent molecular mechanisms of smoke-induced  placental abnormalities.",

        "Abstract": "Succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH) deficiency is a rare disorder  characterized by an inborn error of the catabolism of the inhibitory  neurotransmitter GABA. Because of the deficiency of SSADH, the final enzyme of the  GABA degradation pathway, the substrate, succinic semialdehyde, is shunted towards  production of 4-hydroxybutyric acid (gamma-hydroxybutyric acid). Elevations of  gamma-hydroxybutyric acid can be detected in the physiologic fluids of patients with  SSADH deficiency, and forms the mainstay of diagnosis. The clinical features of  SSADH deficiency include nonspecific neurologic manifestations such as mental  retardation/developmental delay, absent speech, hypotonia, nonprogressive ataxia,  features of autism or pervasive developmental delay, developmental language delay  (dyspraxia, receptive, and expressive delays), and occasionally, seizures. Although  the metabolic pathway has been established, it is not known whether insufficient  GABA and/or excess gamma-hydroxybutyric acid contribute to the disease phenotype.  Pharmacological therapy in patients with this disorder has been limited to  vigabatrin, an anticonvulsant that blocks GABA transaminase. This review will  discuss therapeutic options in SSADH deficiency, on the basis of patient experience,  and preliminary work using a murine model. Finally, a discussion of adjunctive  therapies will be included.",

        "Title": "Developmental Outcomes of Aicardi Gouti\u00e8res Syndrome.",
        "Abstract": "Aicardi Gouti\u00e8res syndrome is a monogenic interferonopathy caused by abnormalities  in the intracellular nucleic acid sensing machinery (TREX1, RNASEH2A, RNASEH2B,  RNASEH2C, SAMHD1, ADAR1, or IFIH1). Most individuals affected by Aicardi Gouti\u00e8res  syndrome exhibit some degree of neurologic impairment, from spastic paraparesis with  relatively preserved cognition to tetraparesis and severe intellectual disability.  Because of this heterogeneity, it is important to fully characterize the  developmental trajectory in Aicardi Gouti\u00e8res syndrome. To characterize the clinical  presentation in Aicardi Gouti\u00e8res syndrome, early features were collected from an  international cohort of children (n = 100) with genetically confirmed Aicardi  Gouti\u00e8res syndrome. There was a heterogeneous age of onset, with overlapping  clusters of presenting symptoms: altered mental status, systemic inflammatory  symptoms, and acute neurologic disability. Next, we created genotype-specific  developmental milestone acquisition curves. Individuals with microcephaly or  TREX1-related Aicardi Gouti\u00e8res syndrome secondary were the most severely affected  and less likely to reach milestones, including head control, sitting, and  nonspecific mama/dada. Individuals affected by SAMHD1, IFIH1, and ADAR attained the  most advanced milestones, with 44% achieving verbal communication and 31%  independently ambulating. Retrospective function scales (Gross Motor Function  Classification System, Manual Ability Classification System, and Communication  Function Classification System) demonstrated that two-thirds of the Aicardi  Gouti\u00e8res syndrome population are severely affected. Our results suggest  multifactorial influences on developmental trajectory, including a strong  contribution from genotype. Further studies are needed to identify the additional  factors that influence overall outcomes to better counsel families and to design  clinical trials with appropriate clinical endpoints.",

        "Title": "Deletions and duplications of developmental pathway genes in 5q31 contribute to  abnormal phenotypes.",
        "Abstract": "Although copy number changes of 5q31 have been rarely reported, deletions have been  associated with some common characteristics, such as short stature, failure to  thrive, developmental delay (DD)/intellectual disability (ID), club feet, dislocated  hips, and dysmorphic features. We report on three individuals with deletions and two  individuals with duplications at 5q31, ranging from 3.6\u2009Mb to 8.1\u2009Mb and 830\u2009kb to  3.4\u2009Mb in size, respectively. All five copy number changes are apparently de novo  and involve several genes that are important in developmental pathways, including  PITX1, SMAD5, and WNT8A. The individuals with deletions have characteristic features  including DD, short stature, club feet, cleft or high palate, dysmorphic features,  and skeletal anomalies. Haploinsufficiency of PITX1, a transcription factor  important for limb development, is likely the cause for the club feet, skeletal  anomalies, and cleft/high palate, while additional genes, including SMAD5 and WNT8A,  may also contribute to additional phenotypic features. Two patients with deletions  also presented with corneal anomalies. To identify a causative gene for the corneal  anomalies, we sequenced candidate genes in a family with apparent autosomal dominant  keratoconus with suggestive linkage to 5q31, but no mutations in candidate genes  were found. The duplications are smaller than the deletions, and the patients with  duplications have nonspecific features. Although development is likely affected by  increased dosage of the genes in the region, the developmental disruption appears  less severe than that seen with deletion.",

        "Title": "Learning by observation and learning by doing in Prader-Willi syndrome.",
        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: New competencies may be learned through active experience (learning by  doing) or observation of others' experience (learning by observation). Observing  another person performing a complex action accelerates the observer's acquisition of  the same action, limiting the time-consuming process of learning by doing. Here, we  compared learning by observation and learning by doing in individuals with  Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). It is hypothesized that PWS individuals could show more  difficulties with learning by observation than learning by doing because of their  specific difficulty in interpreting and using social information. METHODS: The  performance of 24 PWS individuals was compared with that of 28 mental age (MA)- and  gender-matched typically developing (TD) children in tasks of learning a visuo-motor  sequence by observation or by doing. To determine whether the performance pattern  exhibited by PWS participants was specific to this population or whether it was a  nonspecific intellectual disability effect, we compared the PWS performances with  those of a third MA- and gender-matched group of individuals with Williams syndrome  (WS). RESULTS: PWS individuals were severely impaired in detecting a sequence by  observation, were able to detect a sequence by doing, and became as efficient as TD  children in reproducing an observed sequence after a task of learning by doing. The  learning pattern of PWS children was reversed compared with that of WS individuals.  CONCLUSIONS: The observational learning deficit in PWS individuals may be rooted, at  least partially, in their incapacity to understand and/or use social information.",

        "Abstract": "It is well established that HIV infection can lead to motor/cognitive disorders in  humans. A number of studies have shown that simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)  infection in rhesus macaques parallels many aspects of HIV disease in humans. The  purpose of this study was to define further the SIV-infected rhesus macaque as a  model of neuro-AIDS. Our objective was to detect movement-related impairments in  behaviorally trained, SIV-infected macaques using both simple and choice reaction  time tasks. Reaction times (RTs), movement times (MTs), and error types were  examined. Nine monkeys were infected with neurovirulent strains of SIVmac, four of  which served initially as controls before their inoculation. Seven of the nine  monkeys developed simian AIDS within 4 months of inoculation (rapid progressors),  while two monkeys survived for more than 1 year postinoculation (slow progressors).  Of the rapid progressors, four exhibited slowed reaction times and six showed  movement time slowing. One rapid progressor showed evidence of a strategy shift to  overcome impaired motor abilities. Monkeys with rapidly progressing SIV-related  disease consistently show behavioral abnormalities reflecting underlying neuronal  injury. Although the slow progressors also showed RT and/or MT slowing, a role for  nonspecific factors related to late-stage simian AIDS could not be ruled out in  these cases. The results demonstrate that motor impairments associated with SIV  infection in rhesus macaques can be detected using RT and MT measures, further  establishing the SIVmac-infected macaque monkey as a viable model of neuro-AIDS.",

        "Title": "Terminal 22q deletion syndrome: a newly recognized cause of speech and language  disability in the autism spectrum.",
        "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Cryptic subtelomeric chromosome rearrangements account for 6% to 10% of  idiopathic mental retardation. As cytogenetic and molecular techniques have become  more sophisticated, the number of genetic syndromes attributed to these  microdeletions has increased. To date, 64 patients have been described in the  literature with a more recently recognized microdeletion syndrome, del 22q13.3. The  purpose of this study is to present 11 new cases of this recently described syndrome  to delineate further the phenotype and to alert the clinician to another genetic  condition that should be considered in the differential diagnosis of early  hypotonia, delayed speech acquisition, and autistic behavior. METHODS: Eleven  patients were evaluated in 3 academic institutions. Clinical features and results of  cytogenetic testing were recorded and tabulated. Reasons for referral for genetic  evaluation included developmental delay, severe expressive speech and language  delay, and dysmorphic features. RESULTS: Age of presentation ranged from 5 months to  46 years. There were 10 female patients and 1 male patient. All of the patients  exhibited delayed motor development, some degree of hypotonia, and severe expressive  speech and language delay. Dysmorphic facial features included epicanthal folds,  large cupped ears, underdeveloped philtrum, loss of cupid's bow, and full  supraorbital ridges. Six patients exhibited autistic-like behaviors. Microscopically  visible chromosome deletions were observed in 6 patients. In the remainder, the  deletion was detected with the use of fluorescence in situ hybridization.  CONCLUSIONS: Hypotonia and developmental delay are nonspecific findings observed in  many malformation and genetic syndromes. However, in association with severe speech  and language delay and autistic-like behavior, this phenotype may be a significant  indication to consider the 22q13 deletion syndrome as a potential cause.",

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Classic phenylketonuria (PKU) is due to an inborn error of metabolism  resulting in an inability to metabolize the amino acid phenylalanine. To avoid  mental retardation, affected individuals observe a phenylalanine-restricted diet.  When dietary control is poor, deficits in prefrontally mediated cognitive functions  have been observed. It has been suggested that these deficits are due to disruptions  in the mesocortical dopamine system that projects to the prefrontal cortex. METHODS:  In this study, dopamine system reactivity was examined in individuals with PKU,  relative to age-matched controls, using the non-specific DA antagonist haloperidol,  in a repeated measures placebo-controlled design. Outcome variables included  neuroendocrine, physiological, and cognitive measures. RESULTS: Regardless of drug  condition, PKU participants differed from control participants in their blood  phenylalanine and tyrosine levels, and in their times to complete measures of  attention and working memory. Also, relative to placebo, haloperidol influenced  several variables irrespective of group status, including serum prolactin secretion,  times to complete attention and working memory tasks, and accuracy of working memory  performance. An interaction between group and drug condition was observed for the  digit span task, where PKU participants exhibited greater relative impairments on  haloperidol. When composite indices of impairment were derived, PKU participants  demonstrated selective disruption in executive function on haloperidol relative to  control subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Findings are consistent with the presence of  frontostriatal dysfunction in PKU but are less consistent with the notion that PFC  dopamine function is specifically affected.",

        "Title": "GABA and epileptogenesis: comparing gabrb3 gene-deficient mice with Angelman  syndrome in man.",
        "Abstract": "The GABAergic system has long been implicated in epilepsy with defects in GABA  neurotransmission being linked to epilepsy in both experimental animal models and  human syndromes (Olsen and Avoli, 1997). However, to date no human epileptic  syndrome has been directly attributed to an altered GABAergic system. The observed  defects in GABA neurotransmission in human epileptic syndromes may be the indirect  result of a brain besieged by seizures. The use of animal models of epilepsy has  sought to address these matters. The advent of gene targeting methodologies in mice  now allows for a more direct assessment of GABA's involvement in epileptogenesis. To  date several genes associated with the GABAergic system have been disrupted. These  include the genes for glutamic acid decarboxylase, both the 65- and 67-kDa isoforms  (GAD65 and GAD67), the tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase gene (TNAP) and  genes for the GABA(A) receptor subunits alpha6, beta3, gamma2, and delta (gabra6,  gabrb3, gabrg2, and gabrd respectively). Gene disruptions of either GAD67 or gabrg2  result in neonatal lethality, while others, GAD65, TNAP, and gabrb3 exhibit  increased mortality and spontaneous seizures. GABA receptor expression has been  found to be both regionally and developmentally regulated. Thus in addition to their  obvious role in controlling excitability in adult brain, a deficit in GABAergic  function during development could be expected to elicit pleiotropic  neurodevelopmental abnormalities perhaps including epilepsy. The GABA(A) receptor  beta3 subunit gene, gabrb3/GABRB3 (mouse/human), is of particular interest because  of its expression early in development and its possible role in the  neurodevelopmental disorder Angelman syndrome. Individuals with this syndrome  exhibit severe mental retardation and epilepsy. Mice with the gabrb3 gene disrupted  likewise exhibit electroencephalograph (EEG) abnormalities, seizures, and behavioral  characteristics typically associated with Angelman syndrome. These gabrb3 gene  knockout mice provide direct evidence that a reduction of a specific subunit of the  GABA(A) receptor system can result in epilepsy and support a GABAergic role in the  pathophysiology of Angelman syndrome.",

        "Title": "[Effect of nonspecific malnutrition on spine morphology of lamina V pyramidal cells  of the cingulate area of juvenile and adult rats].",
        "Abstract": "The spine morphology of LV--pyramidal neurons in the cingulate cortex was analyzed,  using drawings of apical side dendrites without ramifications, by light  microscopical analysis of 5300 times magnification in GOLGI-preparations of the  brains of 11 and 60 days old control rats as well as of experimental animals reared  under starvation conditions from day 1 till day 60 of their postnatal life. The  spine density and the relative frequency of three different spine types (thin,  mushroom and stubby shaped) was estimated in control and undernourished animals.  Undernutrition resulted in a considerable deficit in the spine number of 25% in 11  days old animals, respectively, of 41% in 60 days old animals. Additionally, in 60  days old undernourished rats changes in the relative frequency of the three spine  types was found. To the thin type belonged 46% (68% in controls) to the mushroom  shaped form 37% (19% in controls) and to the stubby type 16% (13% in controls) of  all visible spines. This pattern in 60 days old undernourished rats was very similar  to the pattern of 11 days old control animals (thin 43%, mushroom 36%, stubby 22%).  The evaluate the differentiation of the dendritic spines during ontogenesis as well  as the disturbing influence of undernutrition on these processes, additional data of  the spine morphology (neck length and head area) were collected. The spines of the  11 days old animals showed a larger head area (undernourished and controls) than the  young adult ones. However, the thin spine type present in 60 days old undernourished  rats exhibits morphological features (extremely long necks of about 2,5 micron in  comparison to 1,6 micron in controls as well as very large heads) which appeared to  be quite similar to the thin and long spine type observed by PURPURA (1975) in human  fetal cortex and in cortex of patients with mental retardation. This super long thin  spine type is considered to be a less ripe stage of the spine development. The  relative high portion of mushroom and stubby shaped spines in undernourished and  young animals points to the same assumption or to degenerative changes in the  experimental animals.",

        "Title": "De novo variants in CACNA1E found in patients with intellectual disability,  developmental regression and social cognition deficit but no seizures.",
        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: De novo variants in the voltage-gated calcium channel subunit \u03b11 E gene  (CACNA1E) have been described as causative of epileptic encephalopathy with  contractures, macrocephaly and dyskinesias. METHODS: Following the observation of an  index patient with developmental delay and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) without  seizures who had a de novo deleterious CACNA1E variant, we screened GeneMatcher for  other individuals with CACNA1E variants and neurodevelopmental phenotypes without  epilepsy. The spectrum of pathogenic CACNA1E variants was compared to the mutational  landscape of variants in the gnomAD control population database. RESULTS: We  identified seven unrelated individuals with intellectual disability, developmental  regression and ASD-like behavioral profile, and notably without epilepsy, who had de  novo heterozygous putatively pathogenic variants in CACNA1E. Age of onset of  clinical manifestation, presence or absence of regression and degree of severity  were variable, and no clear-cut genotype-phenotype association could be recognized.  The analysis of disease-associated variants and their comparison to benign variants  from the control population allowed for the identification of regions in the CACNA1E  protein that seem to be intolerant to substitutions and thus more likely to harbor  pathogenic variants. As in a few reported cases with CACNA1E variants and epilepsy,  one patient showed a positive clinical behavioral response to topiramate, a specific  calcium channel modulator. LIMITATIONS: The significance of our study is limited by  the absence of functional experiments of the effect of identified variants, the  small sample size and the lack of systematic ASD assessment in all participants.  Moreover, topiramate was given to one patient only and for a short period of time.  CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that CACNA1E variants may result in  neurodevelopmental disorders without epilepsy and expand the mutational and  phenotypic spectrum of this gene. CACNA1E deserves to be included in gene panels for  non-specific developmental disorders, including ASD, and not limited to patients  with seizures, to improve diagnostic recognition and explore the possible efficacy  of topiramate.",

        "Abstract": "It is estimated that about 4% of the general population may have amusia (or tone  deafness). Congenital amusia is a lifelong disability for processing music despite  normal intellectual, memory, and language skills. Here we present evidence that the  disorder stems from a deficit in fine-grained pitch perception. Amusic and control  adults were presented with monotonic and isochronous sequences of five tones (i.e.,  constant pitch and intertone interval). They were required to detect when the fourth  tone was displaced in pitch or time. All amusic participants were impaired in  detecting the pitch changes, and showed no sign of improvement with practice. In  contrast, they detected time changes as well as control adults and exhibited similar  improvements with practice. Thus, the degraded pitch perception seen in the amusic  individuals cannot be ascribed to nonspecific problems with the task or to poor  hearing in general. Rather, the data point to the presence of a congenital neural  anomaly that selectively impairs pitch processing.",

        "Abstract": "PURPOSE: The pathomechanism and treatment of PCDH19 female epilepsy (PCDH19-FE)  remain unclear. Here, we report that corticosteroids are effective for control of  the seizure clusters or other acute symptoms of PCDH19-FE and argue for the possible  involvement of a compromised blood-brain barrier (BBB) in its pathogenesis. METHODS:  The efficacy of corticosteroids was retrospectively reviewed in five Japanese  patients with PCDH19-FE. The results of antibody assays against the  N-methyl-d-aspartate-type glutamate receptor (abs-NR) in serum/cerebrospinal fluid  were also compiled. RESULTS: Corticosteroid treatments significantly improved the  acute symptoms, including seizure clusters, in all cases, most often immediately  after the initial administration. However, the effect was transient, and some  seizures recurred within a few weeks, especially in association with fever. Serum  and/or cerebrospinal fluid abs-NR were detected in all patients. Target sequences of  the detected antibodies were multiple, and the titers tended to decrease over time.  In one patient, immunohistochemical analysis using rat hippocampal slices also  revealed serum antibodies targeting an unknown epitope in neuronal cytoplasm.  CONCLUSION: Our findings imply an involvement of inflammatory processes in the  pathogenesis of PCDH19-FE and therapeutic utility for corticosteroids as an  adjunctive option in acute treatment. PCDH19 is well expressed in brain  microvascular endothelial cells and thus its impairment may cause BBB vulnerability,  which may be ameliorated by corticosteroids. The abs-NR detected in our patients may  not indicate an autoimmune pathomechanism, but may rather represent non-specific  sensitization to degraded neuronal components entering the general circulation, the  latter process facilitated by the BBB vulnerability.",

        "Title": "Diagnostic Difficulties in a Pediatric Insulinoma: A Case Report.",
        "Abstract": "Insulinomas are functional neuroendocrine pancreatic tumors rarely encountered in  pediatric pathology. Insulinomas are usually solitary and sporadic, but may occur in  association with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1. Whipple's triad-hypoglycemia,  simultaneous compatible adrenergic and/or neurological signs, and relief of symptoms  upon the administration of glucose-remains the fundamental diagnostic tool. We  report a case of insulinoma in an 11-year-old boy with malnutrition and mild psychic  retardation. History revealed neuroglycopenic symptoms associated with hypoglycemia  that returned to normal values after glucose intravenous infusion; before admission  in our unit, the levels of circulating insulin, as well as the abdominal ultrasound  and abdominal computed tomography scan, were reported within normal range. During  hospitalization in our service, the glycemic curves showed recurring low values  associated with low glycated hemoglobin, positive fasting test, and elevated  C-peptide. The pancreatic ultrasound was inconclusive, but the magnetic resonance  imaging revealed a high signal focal area with a diameter of 1 cm, located in the  tail of pancreas. Conventional enucleation of the lesion prompted a spectacular  normalization of glucose metabolism and the alleviation of the main clinical  symptoms. The child had a favorable evolution in the clinical follow-up, presenting  with weight gain and progressive remission to complete disappearance of most  symptoms-except for the mental impairments. Although in our case Whipple's triad was  apparent from the beginning, the diagnosis was delayed due to the failure of  conventional imaging methods in locating the tumor. Weight loss and mental  impairment contributed to the diagnosis pitfalls. Pediatricians should be aware of  confusing and nonspecific symptoms, especially when children with insulinoma present  mental or neurological retardation. Despite the existence of medical regimens,  surgery remains the gold standard for the therapeutic approach to this condition.",

        "Title": "Primary ovarian insufficiency in a female with phosphomannomutase-2 gene (PMM2)  mutations for congenital disorder of glycosylation.",
        "Abstract": "Primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) is a highly heterogeneous condition, and its  underlying causes remain to be clarified in a large fraction of patients. Congenital  disorders of glycosylation (CDG) are multisystem diseases caused by mutations of a  number of genes involved in N-glycosylation or O-glycosylation, and the most  frequent form is PMM2-CDG (alias, CDG-Ia) resulting from biallelic mutations in PMM2  encoding phosphomannomutase-2 involved in N-glycosylation. Here, we examined a 46,XX  Japanese female with syndromic POI accompanied by an undetectable level of serum  anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone (AMH). Whole exome sequencing identified biallelic pathogenic  mutations of PMM2 (a novel c.34G>C:p.(Asp12His) of maternal origin and a recurrent  c.310C>G:p.(Leu104Val) of paternal origin) (NM_000303.3), and N-glycosylation  studies detected asialotransferrin and disialotransferrin characteristic of  PMM2-CDG, in addition to normally glycosylated tetrasialotransferrin. Clinical  assessment showed cerebellar hypotrophy, which is a fairly characteristic and highly  prevalent feature in PMM2-CDG, together with multiple non-specific features reported  in PMM2-CDG such as characteristic face, intellectual disability, skeletal  abnormalities, and low blood antithrombin III value. These results including the  undetectable level of serum AMH, in conjunction with previously reported findings  suggestive of the critical role of glycosylation in oocyte development and function,  imply that PMM2-CDG almost invariably leads to POI primarily because of the  defective oogenesis and/or oocyte-dependent early folliculogenesis rather than the  compromised bioactivity of FSH/LH with defective glycosylation. Thus, it is  recommended to examine PMM2 in patients with syndromic POI, especially in those with  cerebellar ataxia/hypotrophy.",

        "Title": "LC-MS/MS measurements of urinary guanidinoacetic acid and creatine: Method  optimization by deleting derivatization step.",
        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cerebral Creatine deficiency syndromes (CCDS) include three hereditary  diseases affecting the metabolism of creatine (Cr): arginine glycine  amidinotransferase deficiency, guanidinoacetate methyltransferase deficiency and  disorders of creatine transporter. These pathologies cause a brain creatine  deficiency responsible of non-specific neurological impairments with mental  retardation. LC-MS/MS measurements of guanidinoacetic acid (GAA) and creatine in  urine and plasma are an important screening test to identify the deficit. Analysis  of this polar and basic molecules not hold on standard column requires a  derivatization step to butyl-esters. To overcome this long and fastidious  derivatization, an ion pairing (IP) method was chosen in this study. METHOD: IP  method was validated using Comit\u00e9 francais d'accr\u00e9ditation (COFRAC) recommendations.  Then, urine GAA and creatine of 15 patients with a CDS deficiency suspected were  tested y LC-MS/MS using IP technique, and performances were assessed with reference  laboratory method (butylation method). Moreover, references values were suggested y  the study of 100 urines samples of healthy patients. RESULTS: The method developed  provided a good accuracy and precision with intra and inter-day coefficients of  variation (CVs) <15%. The curve was linear for the biological and pathological  concentrations. The comparison with the reference method did not reveal any  significant difference for analytical performances but showed a simplification of  the preparation of samples. CONCLUSION: The use of IP technique that we have  developed demonstrated a good correlation with the butylation method. Moreover, this  new method not only allows a simplification of the technique, but also decreases in  run time.",

        "Title": "Succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency in children and adults.",
        "Abstract": "Succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency is a rare disorder of the degradation  pathway of gamma-aminobutyric acid. The disorder is detected when 4-hydroxybutyric  aciduria is present on urine organic acid analysis, and is subsequently confirmed by  enzyme measurement on leucocytes. The disorder has been identified in approximately  350 individuals worldwide. We review the clinical features in 60 patients. The most  common characteristics are developmental delay maximally involving expressive  language, hypotonia, mental retardation, ataxia, and behavioral problems. Seizures  occur in approximately half of patients, and include tonic-clonic, absence, and  myoclonic seizures, including status epilepticus. Electroencephalographic findings  are background slowing and generalized and focal epileptiform discharges. Magnetic  resonance imaging typically reveals increased T2-weighted signal of the globus  pallidus bilaterally, with variable involvement of white matter and the cerebellar  dentate nucleus. Preliminary human cerebrospinal fluid measurements are consistent  with neurometabolic aberrations documented in the murine animal model, with  elevations in gamma-aminobutyric acid, gamma-hydroxybutyrate, and homocarnosine, and  low glutamine. Succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency may be an  underrecognized neurometabolic disorder with a nonspecific and wide phenotypic  spectrum, and carries implications for a comprehensive fundamental understanding of  interrelations between multiple neurotransmitter systems.",

        "Abstract": "AIM: Nuclear \u03b1-thalassemia/mental retardation X-linked (ATRX) loss and alternative  lengthening of telomeres (ALT) are linked in distinct malignancies. We therefore  aimed to determine the nuclear ATRX expression correlated with ALT in a  comprehensive series of sarcomas. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 573 formalin-fixed  paraffin-embedded sarcomas comprising 28 entities were investigated for nuclear ATRX  expression by immunohistochemistry. Telomere-specific fluorescence in-situ  hybridization (FISH) was used to determine the ALT phenotype in 50 sarcomas with  complete or heterogeneous ATRX loss. Complete nuclear ATRX loss was detected in 58  of 573 sarcomas, all high-grade, with the highest prevalence in undifferentiated  pleomorphic sarcomas (38%) and pleomorphic liposarcomas (38%), followed by  dedifferentiated liposarcomas (24%), osteosarcomas (21%), leiomyosarcomas (17%),  myxofibrosarcomas (11%) and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours (4%).  Interestingly, a further 20 sarcomas, all belonging to the aforementioned entities  with complete ATRX loss, presented with a heterogeneous ATRX expression pattern. ALT  was observed in 41 of 42 sarcomas with complete ATRX loss, but only in two of eight  sarcomas with heterogeneous expression. CONCLUSION: Nuclear ATRX loss, either  complete or heterogeneous, is encountered in a considerable number of high-grade  sarcomas with non-specific genetic alterations. A causal relationship with ALT might  be indicated at least in cases with a complete nuclear ATRX loss.",

        "Title": "The prevalence and clinical impact of pulmonary artery sling on school-aged  children: a large-scale screening study.",
        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Airway obstruction is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in  patients with pulmonary artery sling (PAS). Early identification of PAS is  imperative for prompt initiation of appropriate treatments. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was  to investigate the prevalence and clinical impact of PAS on school-aged children  through a large-scale pre-sports participation cardiovascular screening (PPCVS)  study. METHODS: A total of 186,213 school-aged children underwent portable  two-dimensional echocardiography (2DE) study in a PPCVS study between 2001 and 2004  in Taichung City, Taiwan. We prospectively collected data on the prevalence of PSA,  demographics, clinical features, tracheo-bronchial anomalies (TBA), on computed  tomography (CT), pulmonary function test (PFT), follow-up data in 1 year, and  clinical outcomes. RESULTS: PAS was identified in 11 children (8 males/3 females)  with a median age of 13 years (range: 7.2-13.7 years). The prevalence of PAS was 1  in 17,000 school-aged children. The majority of children with PAS had recurrent  broncho-pulmonary infections (90.9%) and asthmatic cough (81.8%), which had a low  positive predictive value of PAS (<1%). Seven patients had diffused complete  cartilaginous rings. The other four patients were found to have prominent localized  external compression of the trachea or bronchus. No coexisting intracardiac  anomalies were found. Two patients had mental retardation. Seven patients underwent  surgical correction without mortality or major complications. After surgery,  significant improvement in PFT was shown in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1)  and functional vital capacity (FVC). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to  determine the prevalence of PAS as 59 per million school-aged children by a  large-scale screening using 2DE. Although the majority of children with PAS have  associated TBA and impaired pulmonary function, all patients with PAS were  unrecognized due to non-specific symptoms. Early identification of PAS and surgery  result in significant improvement in pulmonary function.",

        "Title": "The neurobiology and genetics of infantile autism.",
        "Abstract": "Autism is a syndrome with multiple etiologies, as is made clear both by the evidence  of neurobiological research and by the catalog of disorders that present with  autistic behaviors. What remains unclear are the specific neuropathological  mechanisms that produce autistic behaviors; for example, is there a common  neuroanatomic pathology for all cases of autism, or can autistic behaviors emerge  from different pathological sequences within the brain? Although it is premature to  generalize, neuropathological studies appear to have identified common abnormalities  in the cerebellum and limbic system of at least five autistic subjects. These  subjects, with variable levels of mental retardation, demonstrated marked Purkinje  cell loss in the cerebellar hemispheres, together with retained fetal neuronal  circuitry in cerebellar nuclei and increased neuronal packing in specific regions of  the limbic system, amygdala, and hippocampus. The architecture of the cerebral  cortex was not affected. Although our knowledge of brain functioning is incomplete,  alterations of the kind noted in the cerebellum and limbic system could reasonably  produce autistic behaviors. For more detail, readers are directed to a review of  cerebellar contributions to higher functions by Schmahmann (1991). Neuroimaging  studies allow less resolution of brain structure than do neuroanatomic studies, and  the reported findings from neuroimaging are somewhat contradictory. However, a  number of investigators have reported structural abnormalities in ventricle size and  cerebral hemispheric asymmetry using CT. MRI, which offers greater resolution, has  uncovered some consistent findings, along with a variety of nonspecific  abnormalities. Common abnormalities include reduced volume of cerebellar hemispheres  and vermal lobules--findings not inconsistent with the above-mentioned  neuropathological defects. It is also interesting to note that individuals with  fragile X syndrome have similar cerebellar findings. PET and NMR studies of autism  are at a preliminary stage, but these methodologies allow insight into the  functioning of the brain, rather than simply brain anatomy. Recent PET studies  indicating decreased association between paired regions of the brains of autistic  subjects are of interest, particularly if they can be confirmed and refined by  additional studies. Neurophysiological studies also offer insight into brain  function, but are subject to numerous methodological criticisms. Nevertheless,  recent reports of diminished P300 waves and absent NC components in autistic  subjects seem to indicate fundamental defects in attention and secondary processing,  which could help explain the self-stimulatory behaviors often seen in autism. The  disturbances in brain development associated with autism can be produced in a number  of ways, and at different times during development of the nervous system.(ABSTRACT  TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

        "Title": "Celiac disease and headache in children: a narrative state of the art.",
        "Abstract": "Celiac disease (CD) is one of the most important entity of the wide spectrum of  gluten-related disorders (GRDs). It is well known that neurological manifestation  can be present either at the onset of CD, or appear during the development of the  pathology, and different can be the neurologic findings. Clinical features are very  variable, ranging from typical manifestations of gastrointestinal involvement to  neurologic symptom. The most frequent neurologic signs reported were headache,  epileptic seizure, migraine, mental retardation, ataxia and attention deficit and  hyperactive disorder. Headache either in form of migraine, or in non-specific form  represents one of the main clinical presentation in CD. The aim of this work is to  provide a narrative review of the pediatric literature focused on the cephalalgic  features of children with CD evaluating the potential benefits of a gluten free diet  (GFD).\u00a0 Papers were identified by searching for related literature in Medline  (PubMed) and Embase using the words \"Celiac Disease\" and \"Headache\" or \"Migraine\" by  specifying \"children\"/\"paediatric age\" for reports published since 1972 till 31th  October 2018. According to our inclusion criteria, a total of 25 papers has been  evaluated. Although it is still controversial if headache is prevalent in CD  children a correct compliance to a GFD seems to improve the neurological symptoms  even if the underlying pathogenic relationship between CD and neurologic system  involvement is still not fully understood.",

        "Abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Kabuki syndrome (KS) is a genetic disorder characterized by intellectual  disability, facial dysmorphism and congenital anomalies. We aim to investigate the  prenatal features of fetuses with KS and to provide a comprehensive review of the  literature on prenatal sonographic abnormalities associated with KS. METHODS: We  retrospectively reviewed the prenatal ultrasound findings of all mothers of children  with molecularly confirmed KS in Hong Kong, between 1991 and 2019. We also performed  systematic review of the literature to identify studies on the prenatal findings in  KS. RESULTS: We identified 11 cases with KS with detectable fetal ultrasound  findings ranging from no detectable abnormalities to a variety of non-specific  findings including increased nuchal translucency, pleural effusion, cardiac  anomalies, renal anomalies, intrauterine growth restriction, polyhydramnios,  oligohydramnios and single umbilical artery. In combining our cases with the 77  cases published, 42 (50.6%) of them had more than one abnormal antenatal ultrasound  finding. The most frequent ultrasound features observed were cardiac anomalies  (49.4%), followed by polyhydramnios (28.9%), genitourinary anomalies (26.5%), single  umbilical artery (15.7%), intrauterine growth restriction (14.5%) and hydrops  fetalis/pleural effusion/ascites (12.0%). CONCLUSIONS: These cases demonstrate the  prenatal phenotypic heterogeneity associated with KS. Although the ultrasound  abnormalities are non-specific, KS should be considered in the differential  diagnosis when these fetal findings following normal microarray  analysis/karyotyping.",

        "Title": "Electroclinical variability of pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy caused by ALDH7A1 gene  mutations in four Taiwanese children.",
        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to describe the electroclinical variability of  four Taiwanese patients with pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy (PDE) caused by ALDH7A1  gene mutations. METHODS: Demographic data, case histories, clinical seizure  patterns, EEG features, neuroimaging findings, ALDH7A1 gene mutations, treatments,  and neurodevelopmental outcomes of the four patients were collected and analyzed.  RESULTS: The four patients exhibited the first symptom between the ages of 6\u00a0days  and 11\u00a0months. The age of diagnosis was between 2\u00a0months and 13\u00a0years 8\u00a0months.  Patient 1 exhibited classical phenotype of PDE, neonatal onset epileptic  encephalopathy. Patient 2 showed atypical phenotypes of intractable epilepsy with  additional neurological and abdominal symptoms. Patients 3 and 4, who had normal  neurodevelopment, had familial epilepsy with fever sensitivity. Patients 2, 3, and 4  had atypical phenotypes and showed seizure exacerbation during febrile infections.  EEG features of patient 1 revealed alternating rhythmic discharges followed by  electrodecremental episodes; while those of patients 2, 3, and 4 disclosed  nonspecific findings or normal results. Administration of oral pyridoxine  hydrochloride resulted in seizure cessation in patients 1, 3, and 4, and they  achieved normal neurodevelopmental outcomes, but intractable epilepsy and profound  mental retardation occurred in patient 2 as he was not diagnosed until he was  13\u00a0years and 8\u00a0months old. CONCLUSION: Electroclinical features of PDE vary widely,  including patients with normal neurodevelopment and normal or nonspecific EEG  findings. To avoid delay in treatment, a therapeutic trial with pyridoxine  hydrochloride should be performed in all cases of neonatal, infantile, and childhood  refractory epilepsy until ALDH7A1 gene mutation-related PDE has been excluded.  Pyridoxine treatment may show clinical effectiveness even in a relatively late  stage, i.e., age older than one year.",

        "Abstract": "We report the case of a 14-year-old girl suffering from severe developmental visual  impairment along with delayed language and cognitive development, and featuring a  clear-cut dissociation between spared dorsal and impaired ventral visual pathways.  Visual recognition of objects, including faces and printed words, was affected. In  contrast, movement perception and visually guided motor control were preserved.  Structural MRI was normal on inspection, but Voxel Based Morphometry (VBM) revealed  reduced grey matter density in the mesial occipital and ventral occipito-temporal  cortex. Functional MRI during the perception of line drawings uncovered impaired  differentiation which is normally observed at even younger ages: no local category  preferences could be identified within the occipito-temporal cortex for faces,  houses, words or tools. In contrast, movement-related activations appeared to be  normal. Finally, those abnormalities evolved on the background of chronic bilateral  occipital epileptic activity, including continuous spike-wave discharges during  sleep, which may be considered as the primary cause of non-specific intellectual  disability and visual impairment.",

        "Abstract": "Objective: To establish and broaden the phenotypic spectrum of secretory carrier  membrane protein (SCAMP5) associated with epilepsy and neurodevelopmental delay.  Methods: A Chinese patient was identified at the First Hospital of Peking  University, and the three unrelated patients were recruited from two different  countries (Italy and United States) through GeneMatcher. SCAMP5 pathogenic variants  were identified by whole exome sequencing; clinical data of the patients were  retrospectively collected and analyzed. Result: The onset age of seizures was ranged  from 6 to 15\u00a0months. Patients had different types of seizures, including focal  seizures, generalized tonic-clonic seizures and tonic seizure. One patient showed  typical autism spectrum disorder (ASD) symptoms. Electroencephalogram (EEG) findings  presented as focal or multifocal discharges, sometimes spreading to generalization.  Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) abnormalities were present in each patient.  Severe intellectual disability and language and motor developmental disorders were  found in our patients, with all patients having poor language development and were  nonverbal at last follow-up. All but one of the patients could walk independently in  childhood, but the ability to walk independently in one patient had deteriorated  with age. All patients had abnormal neurological exam findings, mostly signs of  extrapyramidal system involvement. Dysmorphic features were found in 2/4 patients,  mainly in the face and trunk. All four unrelated patients were found to have the  same heterozygous pathogenic SCAMP5 de novo variant (p. Gly180Trp). Conclusion:  Epilepsy, severe developmental delay, abnormal neurological exam findings, with or  without ASD or variably dysmorphic features and were common in patients with SCAMP5  variant. The onset time and type of seizure varied greatly. The EEG and brain MRI  findings were not consistent, but diverse and nonspecific. The motor ability of  patients with heterozygous SCAMP5 variant might have a regressive course; language  development was more severely affected.",

        "Abstract": "Nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome is an autosomal dominant condition  characterized by multiple basal cell carcinomas, skeletal abnormalities and  sometimes mental retardation. The large number of tumors, which are often  disfiguring, presents extreme difficulties in the treatment of these patients.  Microscopically controlled excision, compared to other modalities (radiation  therapy, photodynamic therapy, intralesional interferon alpha-2b) offers the highest  cure rate. However, because of the large size and involvement of wide areas of the  skin, this approach is sometimes impractical. The ultrapulse CO2 laser with high  energy and short pulses achieves char-free ablation of the tumors, bloodless  surgical field, minimal nonspecific thermal damage, rapid healing and diminished  postoperative pain. Also, a number of lesions can be removed in a single session. We  present a 48-year-old man with a 6.5 x 4.5 cm large basal cell carcinoma involving  the anterior abdomen and navel area. The central thick portion of the tumor was  resected by microscopically controlled excision with 3 stages, and wide thinner  peripheral crescentic plaque vaporized with ultrapulse CO2 laser. The laser settings  were 300 mJ energy/pulse and 100 W average power, which corresponds to the fluence  of 7.5 J/cm2. Computerized pattern generator (ultrascan handpiece) was adjusted to  patterns of 3 (circle) and 1 (square) with sizes varying from 5 to 7, and density of  9 (60% overlapping). The tumor was vaporized with 6 passes, all the way to deep  reticular dermis. A fifteen month-follow up disclosed no recurrent disease.  Subsequent biopsies revealed only a scar with postinflammatory hyperpigmentation.  Our experience indicates that combined treatment with microscopically controlled  excision and ultrapulse CO2 laser ablation is a suitable modality for the large  tumor plaques involving concave and convex areas of the skin respectively.  Microscopically controlled excision of thicker, concave portions of basal cell  carcinoma plaques, where CO2 laser surgery is less feasible, presents an effective  addition that renders this combined modality a successful method for the treatment  of nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome.",

        "Title": "Phenotypic spectrum associated with de novo and inherited deletions and duplications  at 16p11.2 in individuals ascertained for diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder.",
        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Recurrent microdeletions and microduplications of approximately 555 kb  at 16p11.2 confer susceptibility to autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in up to 1% of  ASD patients. No physical or behavioural features have been identified that  distinguish these individuals as having a distinct ASD subtype, but clinical data  are limited. METHODS: We report five autistic probands identified by microarray  analysis with copy number variation (CNV) of 16p11.2 (three deletions, two  duplications). Each patient was assessed for ASD and dysmorphic features. We also  describe a deletion positive 26-month-old female who has developmental delay (DD)  and autistic features. RESULTS: Proband 1 (female with ASD, de novo deletion) is not  dysmorphic. Proband 2 (male with autism, de novo deletion) and proband 3 and his  brother (males with autism, inherited deletions) are dysmorphic, but the two  probands do not resemble one another. The mother of proband 3 has mild mental  retardation (MR), minor dysmorphism and meets the criteria for ASD. Proband 4  (dysmorphic autistic male, de novo duplication) had a congenital diaphragmatic  hernia. Proband 5 (non-dysmorphic ASD female with a duplication) has two apparently  healthy duplication positive relatives. Probands 1 and 2 have deletion negative  siblings with ASD and Asperger syndrome, respectively. Proband 6 (a female with DD  and an inherited duplication) is dysmorphic, but has oligohydramnios sequence.  CONCLUSIONS: The phenotypic spectrum associated with CNV at 16p11.2 includes ASD,  MR/DD and/or possibly other primary psychiatric disorders. Compared with the  microduplications, the reciprocal microdeletions are more likely to be penetrant and  to be associated with non-specific major or minor dysmorphism. There are deletion  positive ASD probands with a less severe phenotype than deletion negative ASD  siblings underscoring the significant phenotypic heterogeneity.",

        "Title": "Rab proteins and Rab-associated proteins: major actors in the mechanism of  protein-trafficking disorders.",
        "Abstract": "Ras-associated binding (Rab) proteins and Rab-associated proteins are key regulators  of vesicle transport, which is essential for the delivery of proteins to specific  intracellular locations. More than 60 human Rab proteins have been identified, and  their function has been shown to depend on their interaction with different  Rab-associated proteins regulating Rab activation, post-translational modification  and intracellular localization. The number of known inherited disorders of vesicle  trafficking due to Rab cycle defects has increased substantially during the past  decade. This review describes the important role played by Rab proteins in a number  of rare monogenic diseases as well as common multifactorial human ones. Although the  clinical phenotype in these monogenic inherited diseases is highly variable and  dependent on the type of tissue in which the defective Rab or its associated protein  is expressed, frequent features are hypopigmentation (Griscelli syndrome), eye  defects (Choroideremia, Warburg Micro syndrome and Martsolf syndrome), disturbed  immune function (Griscelli syndrome and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease) and  neurological dysfunction (X-linked non-specific mental retardation,  Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, Warburg Micro syndrome and Martsolf syndrome). There is  also evidence that alterations in Rab function play an important role in the  progression of multifactorial human diseases, such as infectious diseases and type 2  diabetes. Rab proteins must not only be bound to GTP, but they need also to be  'prenylated'-i.e. bound to the cell membranes by isoprenes, which are intermediaries  in the synthesis of cholesterol (e.g. geranyl geranyl or farnesyl compounds). This  means that isoprenylation can be influenced by drugs such as statins, which inhibit  isoprenylation, or biphosphonates, which inhibit that farnesyl pyrophosphate  synthase necessary for Rab GTPase activity. CONCLUSION: Although protein-trafficking  disorders are clinically heterogeneous and represented in almost every subspeciality  of pediatrics, the identification of common pathogenic mechanisms may provide a  better diagnosis and management of patients with still unknown Rab cycle defects and  stimulate the development of therapeutic agents.",

        "Title": "Successful treatment of psychosis induced by interferon alpha and ribavirin with  paliperidone: first case reported.",
        "Abstract": "Several clinical studies have shown a large number of mental symptoms by  immunomodulatory treatment with interferon (IFN). The most frequently described  symptoms are depression, suicidal behaviour, manic symptoms, anxiety, psychosis and  delirium, associated with other non-specific symptoms such as fatigue, irritability,  psychomotor retardation, decreased libido, insomnia, difficulty in concentration and  attention. Having a history of mental disorder contraindicates the use of IFN-alpha.  These adverse effects that affect the mental state appear usually at the beginning  of the treatment (most after 3 weeks of treatment). The incidence of psychotic  episodes is low and the episodes usually remit when treatment is interrupted; only  some cases require antipsychotic treatment. We present the case of a patient  affected with hepatitis C who began to present self-referential delirious symptoms  after receiving the treatment with IFN and who was successfully treated with  paliperidone. This patient could be classified within the group of high-risk  psychiatric patients given the family history of schizophrenia and his personal  history of illegal drug consumption. The pharmacological actions of paliperidone are  similar to other high potency atypical antipsychotics. The receptor-binding profile  of paliperidone most closely resembles that of risperidone and ziprasidone.  Paliperidone differs from risperidone and most other antipsychotics by its  relatively low extent of enzymatic hepatic metabolism. To the best of our knowledge,  this is the first case described that was successfully treated with paliperidone.",

These entities are manifest by visual, intellectual, and motor deterioration  as well as recurrent seizures. Computed tomography has been shown to demonstrate  changes of cerebral atrophy in more severely affected patients. Seven patients with  neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis were examined with both computed tomography and  magnetic resonance imaging, and the results were correlated with the clinical  severity of the disorder. Two less severely affected patients had normal results on  computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging studies. Varying degrees of  cerebral atrophy were seen in the remaining five patients with both computed  tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. Severity of atrophy correlated with the  severity of disability in these patients. Abnormal white matter was seen in the two  most severely affected patients only with magnetic resonance imaging. Although the  findings in patients with neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis were nonspecific, the  increased sensitivity of magnetic resonance imaging for subtle white matter  abnormalities over computed tomography may prove helpful in monitoring the  progression of this rare disorder.",

        "Title": "Inhibition of KDM1A activity restores adult neurogenesis and improves hippocampal  memory in a mouse model of Kabuki syndrome.",
        "Abstract": "Kabuki syndrome (KS) is a rare cause of intellectual disability primarily caused by  loss-of-function mutations in lysine-specific methyltransferase 2D (KMT2D), which  normally adds methyl marks to lysine 4 on histone 3. Previous studies have shown  that a mouse model of KS (Kmt2d (+/\u03b2Geo) ) demonstrates disruption of adult  neurogenesis and hippocampal memory. Proof-of-principle studies have shown postnatal  rescue of neurological dysfunction following treatments that promote chromatin  opening; however, these strategies are non-specific and do not directly address the  primary defect of histone methylation. Since lysine-specific demethylase 1A  (LSD1/KDM1A) normally removes the H3K4 methyl marks added by KMT2D, we hypothesized  that inhibition of KDM1A demethylase activity may ameliorate molecular and  phenotypic defects stemming from KMT2D loss. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated a  recently developed KDM1A inhibitor (TAK-418) in Kmt2d (+/\u03b2Geo) mice. We found that  orally administered TAK-418 increases the numbers of newly born doublecortin  (DCX)(+) cells and processes in the hippocampus in a dose-dependent manner. We also  observed TAK-418-dependent rescue of histone modification defects in hippocampus  both by western blot and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq).  Treatment rescues gene expression abnormalities including those of immediate early  genes such as\u00a0FBJ osteosarcoma oncogene (Fos) and FBJ osteosarcoma oncogene homolog  B (Fosb). After 2\u00a0weeks of TAK-418, Kmt2d (+/\u03b2Geo) mice demonstrated normalization  of hippocampal memory defects. In summary, our data suggest that KDM1A inhibition is  a plausible treatment strategy for KS and support the hypothesis that the epigenetic  dysregulation secondary to KMT2D dysfunction plays a major role in the postnatal  neurological disease phenotype in KS.",

        "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate attachment behavior in a  population of infants with infantile spasms (ISs) using the Strange Situation  Procedure (SSP) and to explore factors associated with the infants' attachment  behavior. METHODS: The SSP was assessed in a population of 29 children with ISs  during the second year of life. In mothers, we assessed anxiety, depression,  maternal emotions, and perception of the temperament of the child, and  sociodemographic characteristics. In children, we assessed epilepsy characteristics,  response to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) at the time of the SSP, and the child's  outcome at 3\u202fyears of age, in terms of intellectual disability (ID), and autism  spectrum disorder (ASD). RESULTS: Insecure attachment was higher than in the general  population (68% versus 32%). It was associated with maternal anxiety, sadness, and  maternal representation of the child at 12\u202fmonths but with none of the child  characteristics including ID, ASD, response to AEDs, or ISs etiology. SIGNIFICANCE:  Nonspecific dimensions were more important than disease characteristics for the  infants' attachment behavior. In conclusion, we propose that interventions targeting  mother-child interaction could prevent attachment insecurity and the developmental  consequences of early epilepsy.",

        "Title": "Antenatal diagnosis of cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome: Prenatal characteristics and  contribution of fetal facial dysmorphic signs in utero. About a case and review of  literature.",
        "Abstract": "Antenatal diagnosis of cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome: prenatal characteristics and  contribution of fetal facial dysmorphic signs in utero. This paper is a case study  and review of literature. \"RASopathies\" is the term coined for a group of genetic  diseases that share modulation inside the MAPKinase pathway. Mutations inside the  coding sequence of any of these genes may be responsible for the upregulation of the  RAS pathway, leading on the clinical level to Type 1 Neurofibromatosis (NF1), Noonan  syndrome (NS), Costello syndrome (CS), Multiple Lentigines, Loose Anagen Hair  syndrome, Cardio-Facio-Cutaneous syndrome (CFCS), and, more recently, Legius  syndrome. While the postnatal presentation of this group is well-known, prenatal  findings are less well recognized. The presence of a RASopathy during the prenatal  period can be suspected on account of non-specific abnormalities: polyhydramnios,  cystic hygroma or high nuchal translucency, macrosomia with proportionate short long  bones, macrocephaly, renal, lymphatic, or cardiac defects. The current case report  underlines the characteristic dysmorphic facial features on 3D-ultrasound  (hypertelorism, down-slanting palpebral fissures, a long and marked philtrum, and  low-set posteriorly rotated ears) that allow for a \"RASopathy\" to be postulated.  After detecting a copy number variation (CNV) absence on a CGH array, we performed a  RASopathy gene panel analysis, which identified a so-far unreported heterozygous de  novo mutation in the BRAF gene (namely NM_004333.4 : c.1396\u202fG\u202f>\u202fC ; p.Gly466Arg).  Genetic counseling has, therefore, focused on the diagnosis of a RASopathy and  predictable phenotype of CFCS, a distinct entity characterized by an increased risk  of intellectual disability and early-onset feeding problems. We suggest that a more  detailed prenatal facial evaluation should be performed in fetuses presenting high  nuchal thickness, heart defects, or unusual findings, along with the absence of a  CNV on a CGH array. Due to the dysmorphic facial features, targeted RASopathy genes  are presumed to likely to be responsible for NS, CFCS, and CS.",

        "Abstract": "CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Primrose syndrome is characterized by macrocephaly,  hypotonia, developmental delay, intellectual disability with expressive speech  delay, behavioral issues, a recognizable facial phenotype, radiographic features,  and altered glucose metabolism. Additional features seen in adults: sparse body  hair, distal muscle wasting, and contractures. Characteristic craniofacial features  include brachycephaly, high anterior hairline, deeply set eyes, ptosis, downslanted  palpebral fissures, high palate with torus palatinus, broad jaw, and large ears with  small or absent lobes. Radiographic features include calcification of the external  ear cartilage, multiple Wormian bones, platybasia, bathrocephaly, slender bones with  exaggerated metaphyseal flaring, mild epiphyseal dysplasia, and spondylar dysplasia.  Additional features include hearing impairment, ocular anomalies, cryptorchidism,  and nonspecific findings on brain MRI. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of Primrose  syndrome is established in a proband with characteristic features and a heterozygous  pathogenic variant in ZBTB20 identified on molecular genetic testing. MANAGEMENT:  Treatment: Individualized educational program, speech therapy, physical therapy, and  occupational therapy as indicated; treatment of behavioral concerns; applied  behavioral analysis for autism; standard treatment for seizures, musculoskeletal  issues, hearing loss, and thyroid dysfunction; oral hypoglycemics or insulin as  needed for diabetes. Surveillance: Monitor growth and development every six months;  speech and developmental assessment every six months; assess for behavioral issues,  seizures, and musculoskeletal complications at each visit; brain stem evoked  response audiometry annually; annual fasting and postprandial blood glucose,  hemoglobin A1c, and assessment for signs and symptoms of thyroid dysfunction.  GENETIC COUNSELING: Primrose syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder. All  probands reported to date with Primrose syndrome whose parents have undergone  molecular genetic testing have the disorder as a result of a de novo ZBTB20  pathogenic variant. If a parent of the proband is known to have the ZBTB20  pathogenic variant identified in the proband, the risk to the sibs of inheriting the  variant is 50%. Once the ZBTB20 pathogenic variant has been identified in an  affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and  preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

        "Title": "Sepiapterin Reductase Deficiency.",
        "Abstract": "CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: The phenotypic spectrum of sepiapterin reductase  deficiency (SRD), which ranges from significant motor and cognitive deficits to only  minimal findings, has not been completely elucidated. Clinical features in the  majority of affected individuals include motor and speech delay, axial hypotonia,  dystonia, weakness, and oculogyric crises; symptoms show diurnal fluctuation and  sleep benefit. Other common features include parkinsonian signs (tremor,  bradykinesia, masked facies, rigidity), limb hypertonia, hyperreflexia, intellectual  disability, psychiatric and/or behavioral abnormalities, autonomic dysfunction, and  sleep disturbances (hypersomnolence, difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, and  drowsiness). Most affected individuals have nonspecific features in infancy  including developmental delays and axial hypotonia; other features develop over  time. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of sepiapterin reductase deficiency is  established in a proband by detection of biallelic pathogenic variants in SPR on  molecular genetic testing or characteristic abnormalities of CSF neurotransmitters  and pterins. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: L-dopa in combination with  carbidopa (or another peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor) is the main therapy used  to correct CNS dopamine deficiency; 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), also in combination  with carbidopa, has shown additional clinical benefit in some. When  L-dopa/5HTP/carbidopa are not tolerated or sufficiently effective some individuals  may benefit from use of other agents such as monoamine oxidase inhibitors, serotonin  reuptake inhibitors, melatonin, dopamine agonists, anticholinergics, and  methylphenidate. These medications most consistently correct motor abnormalities;  however, in some individuals cognitive manifestations remain more refractory.  Prevention of secondary complications: Physical, occupational, and speech therapy  may improve or maintain motor function. Surveillance: Data are insufficient to  determine how frequently CSF levels of dopamine and serotonin metabolites should be  evaluated and whether these levels should be used to adjust medication doses.  Agents/circumstances to avoid: Although adverse events with specific agents have not  been reported in persons with SRD, the following should be avoided on a theoretic  basis: sulfa drugs, methotrexate, nitrous oxide, neuroleptics, and other dopamine  antagonists (e.g., metoclopramide). Evaluation of relatives at risk: Although no  data on outcomes are available, it is appropriate to use molecular genetic testing  for the SPR pathogenic variants identified in the proband and/or analysis of CSF  neurotransmitter metabolites and pterins to clarify the genetic status of apparently  asymptomatic older and younger sibs of an affected individual in order to identify  as soon as possible those who would benefit from early initiation of treatment to  correct CNS dopamine and serotonin deficiency. GENETIC COUNSELING: SRD is inherited  in an autosomal recessive manner. At conception, each sib of an affected individual  has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier,  and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Carrier testing for at-risk  relatives and prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk are possible if the  SPR pathogenic variants in the family are known.",

        "Title": "[Clinical studies of pediatric malabsorption syndromes].",
        "Abstract": "Multiple cases with various types of pediatric malabsorption syndromes were  evaluated. The clinical manifestations, laboratory findings, pathophysiology, and  histopathological descriptions of each patient were analyzed in an effort to clear  the pathogenesis of the malabsorption syndromes and the treatments were undertaken.  The cases studied, included one patient with cystic fibrosis, two with lactose  intolerance with lactosuria (Durand type), one with primary intestinal  lymphangiectasia, two with familial hypobetalipoproteinemia, one with Hartnup  disease, one with congenital chroride diarrhea, one with acrodermatitis  enteropathica, one with intestinal nodular lymphoid hyperplasia (NLH), five with  intractable diarrhea of early infancy and four with glycogenosis type Ia. Each case  description and outcome is described below: 1. A 15-year-old Japanese boy with  cystic fibrosis presented with severe symptoms, including pancreatic insufficiency,  bronchiectasis, pneumothorax and hemoptysis. His prognosis was poor. Analysis of the  CFTR genes of this patient revealed a homozygous large deletion from intron 16 to  17b. 2. In the sibling case of Durand type lactose intolerance, the  subjects'disaccaridase activity of the small bowel, including lactase, were within  normal limits. The results of per oral and per intraduodenal lactose tolerance tests  confirmed lactosuria in both. These observations suggested, not only an abnormal  gastric condition, but also duodenal and intestinal mucosal abnormal permeability of  lactose. 3. In the case of primary intestinal lymphangiectasia, the subject had a  lymphedematous right arm and hand, a grossly coarsened mucosal pattern of the upper  gastrointestinal tract (identified via radiologic examination) and the presence of  lymphangiectasia (confirmed via duodenal mucosal biopsy). The major laboratory  findings were hypoalbuminemia, decreased immunoglobulin levels and lymphopenia  resulting from loss of lymph fluid and protein into the gastro-intestinal tract. 4.  In two cases of heterozygous familial hypobetalipoproteinemia, serum total  cholesterol and betalipoprotein levels were very low. The subjects presented with  symptoms and signs of acanthocytosis and fat malabsorption. Further, one subject had  neurological abnormalities such as mental retardation and severe convulsions.  Treatment with MCT formula diet corrected the lipid malabsorption. 5. A 5-year-old  girl presented with pellagra-like rashes, mental retardation and cerebellar ataxia.  An oral tryptophan (Trp) and dipeptide (Trp-Phe) loading test were conducted and the  renal clearance of amino acids was also evaluated in this patient and in controls.  Following the oral Trp loading test, plasma levels of Trp indicated a lower peak in  the case, reaching a maximum at 60 minutes. On the other hand, the oral dipeptide  (Trp-Phe) loading test in the Hartnup patient showed the peak Trp plasma level was  the same as the control subjects. The renal clearance of neutral amino acids in this  case increased to levels 5 to 35 times normal. 6. In the case of congenital chloride  diarrhea, the subject had secondary lactose intolerance, dehydration, hyponatremia,  hypokalemia, hypochloremia, hyperreninemia and metabolic alkalosis. The chloride  content of her fecal fluid was very high. The concentrations were 89-103 mEq/l. In  contrast, her urine was chloride-free. The subject's growth and development improved  after treatment with lactose free formura and oral replacement of the fecal loses of  water, NaCl and KCl. Unfortunately, the patient died of a small bowel  intussusception. The kidney histopathological finding was juxtaglomerular  hyperplasia by a necropsy. 7. In the case of acrodermatitis enteropathica, the  subject had characteristic skin lesions, low serum zinc levels and ALPase activity.  An oral ZnSO4 loading test and intestinal mucosal histology by a peroral biopsy were  conducted. The serum zinc peak level was 2 hours after the oral ZnSO4 loading test.  Infant formula alone could not maintain normal serum zinc ranges. Light microscopic  studies of the intestinal villous architecture showed a normal pattern. However,  ultrastructual examination of several epithelial cells revealed numerous  intracellular vesicles. After zinc therapy, these changes were decreased. The  lesions were postulated as the secondary result of zinc deficiency. 8. A 12-year-old  girl presented with hypogammaglobulinemia, recurrent infections, chronic diarrhea  and intestinal NLH. A barium meal and follow-through examination showed multiple  nodules throughout the stomach and intestine. The nodules, all uniform in size, were  2 mm diameter. The barium enema did not show NLH in the colon. Mucosal biopsy of the  stomach and jejunum revealed the typical histology of NLH in the lamina propria.  Also, achlorhydria was present in this patient and her serum gastrin levels were  very high; 315-775 pg/ml. 9. In 4 cases of intractable diarrhea in early infancy (by  Avery G B), a jejunal biopsy showed shortening villi and nonspecific enterocolitis.  Some patients were found with only low lactase or low lactase and sucrase levels. An  electron microscope analysis of the small bowel in 2 cases showed alterations:  increased pinocytosis in microvillus membranes and lysosomes by endocytosis of  undigested macromolecular substances. I postulated that the stated evidence was  causative of this clinical profile. 10. I frequently observed diarrhea as a clinical  manifestation in glycogenosis type Ia and lipid malabsorption in one case. The light  and electron photomicrographs showed intestinal absorption cells with the glycogen  deposits in the inferior devision of nuclei.",

        "Title": "Prenatal diagnosis of cri-du-chat syndrome by SNP array: report of twelve cases and  review of the literature.",
        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cri-du-chat syndrome (CdCS; OMIM#123450) is a classic contiguous gene  syndrome caused by chromosome 5p terminal deletion (5p-), which characterized by a  high-pitched cat-like cry, developmental delay, severe psychomotor, mental  retardation, and dysmorphic features in infancy. Prenatal diagnosis of CdCS is  difficult due to the non-specific ultrasound features. And reports using array  analysis are rare. This study presented the first retrospective analysis of prenatal  series of CdCS fetuses diagnosed by single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array in  China. CASE PRESENTATION: A total of 35,233 pregnant women were enrolled from Jan  2014 to April 2019 in our center, there are twelve 5p- cases with abnormal  sonographic signs revealed by SNP array, giving an incidence of 0.034% (12/35,233).  Clinical information and molecular basis included: maternal demographics,  indications for invasive testing, sonographic findings and SNP array results. Among  all the 5p- cases revealed, nine cases were diagnosed by both karyotyping and SNP  array, three cases were detected only by SNP array. Half of our cases (6/12) had an  isolated 5p terminal deletion, which sizes ranged from 9.0\u2009Mb to 30\u2009Mb. The other  half of cases (6/12) characterized by unbalanced translocation, with sex ratio 7:5  (female: male), when combine the clinical features observed from this study and  available literature, the most frequent anomaly observed in prenatal ultrasound  examination of CdCS was cerebral abnormalities, accounted for 44.4% (16/36) of the  existing cases. Features that are less consistent included: choroid plexus cyst  (13.8%, 5/36), single umbilical artery (13.3%, 4/30), ventricular septal defect  (11.1%, 4/36), hydrops fetalis (8.3%, 3/36), ascites (8.3%, 3/36), increased NT/NF  (8.3%, 3/36), absent/severely hypoplastic nasal bone (5.5%, 2/36), in order.  CONCLUSION: Prenatal findings such as cerebral abnormalities, absent/hypoplastic  nasal bone, hydrops fetalis, ascites or encephalocele may act as suggestive signs of  CdCS or other microdeletion/duplication syndromes. Combining typical karyotyping  with chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) is a definitive method for a precise  diagnosis of CdCS and provides more accurate results in order to offer genetic  counseling to families which need to deal with cryptic aberrations.",

Two patients suffered from a primarily chronic form of  neuroborreliosis and displayed only non-specific symptoms. An 11 year old boy  presented with long standing symptoms of severe weight loss and chronic headache,  while the other patient had pre-existing mental and motor retardation and developed  seizures and failure to thrive. Two further children who presented with acute  hemiparesis as a result of cerebral ischaemic infarction had a cerebrovascular  course of neuroborreliosis. One was a 15 year old girl; the other, a 5 year old boy,  is to our knowledge the youngest patient described with this course of illness.  Following adequate antibiotic treatment, all patients showed substantial improvement  of their respective symptoms. Laboratory and magnetic resonance imaging findings as  well as clinical course are discussed and the relevant literature is reviewed.",

        "Abstract": "We have collected and analyzed clinical information from 11 patients with chromosome  4p deletions or rearrangements characterized by various molecular techniques.  Comparing the extent of these patients' deletions with their respective clinical  presentations led to the proposal of a preliminary phenotypic map of chromosome 4p.  This map consists of regions which, when deleted, are associated with specific  clinical manifestations. Nonspecific changes such as mental and growth retardation  are not localized, and probably result from the deletion of more than one gene or  region. The region associated with most of the facial traits considered typical in  Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome (WHS) patients coincides with the currently proposed WHS  critical region (WHSCR), but some anomalies commonly seen in WHS appear to map  outside of the WHSCR. The observation of clinodactyly in 2 patients with  nonoverlapping deletions allows assignment of these defects to at least 2 separate  regions in 4p16. These initial observations and attempts at genotype/phenotype  correlation lay the groundwork for identifying the genetic basis of these  malformations, a common objective of gene mapping efforts and chromosome deletion  studies.",

        "Title": "Re-analysis of whole-exome sequencing data reveals a novel splicing variant in the  SLC2A1 in a patient with GLUT1 Deficiency Syndrome 1 accompanied by hemangioma: a  case report.",
        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: GLUT1 Deficiency Syndrome 1 (GLUT1DS1) is a neurological disorder caused  by either heterozygous or homozygous mutations in the Solute Carrier Family 2,  Member 1 (SLC2A1) gene. SLC2A1 encodes Glucose transporter type 1 (GLUT1) protein,  which is the primary glucose transporter at the blood-brain barrier. A ketogenic  diet (KD) provides an alternative fuel for brain metabolism to treat impaired  glucose transport. By reanalyzing exome data, we identified a de novo heterozygous  SLC2A1 variant in a girl with epilepsy. After reversed phenotyping with  neurometabolic tests, she was diagnosed with GLUT1DS1 and started on a KD. The  patient's symptoms responded to the diet. Here, we report a patient with GLUT1DS1  with a novel SLC2A1 mutation. She also has a hemangioma which has not been reported  in association with this syndrome before. CASE PRESENTATION: A 5-year 8-month girl  with global developmental delay, spasticity, intellectual disability, dysarthric  speech, abnormal eye movements, and hemangioma. The electroencephalography (EEG)  result revealed that she had epilepsy. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed that  non-specific white matter abnormalities. Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) was previously  performed, but the case remained unsolved. The re-analysis of WES data revealed a  heterozygous splicing variant in the SLC2A1 gene. Segregation analysis with parental  DNA samples indicated that the variant occurred de novo. Lumbar puncture (LP)  confirmed the diagnosis, and the patient started on a KD. Her seizures responded to  the KD. She has been seizure-free since shortly after the initiation of the diet.  She also had decreased involuntary movements, her speech became more understandable,  and her vocabulary increased after the diet. CONCLUSIONS: We identified a novel de  novo variant in the SLC2A1 gene in a patient who previously had a negative WES  result. The patient has been diagnosed with GLUT1DS1. The syndrome is a treatable  condition, but the differential diagnosis is not an easy process due to showing a  wide range of phenotypic spectrum and the overlapping symptoms with other  neurological diseases. The diagnosis necessitates a genomic testing approach. Our  findings also highlight the importance of re-analysis to undiagnosed cases after  initial WES to reveal disease-causing variants.",

        "Title": "Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification for genetic screening in autism  spectrum disorders: efficient identification of known microduplications and  identification of a novel microduplication in ASMT.",
        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: It has previously been shown that specific microdeletions and  microduplications, many of which also associated with cognitive impairment (CI), can  present with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Multiplex ligation-dependent probe  amplification (MLPA) represents an efficient method to screen for such recurrent  microdeletions and microduplications. METHODS: In the current study, a total of 279  unrelated subjects ascertained for ASDs were screened for genomic disorders  associated with CI using MLPA. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH),  quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) and/or direct DNA sequencing were  used to validate potential microdeletions and microduplications.  Methylation-sensitive MLPA was used to characterize individuals with duplications in  the Prader-Willi/Angelman (PWA) region. RESULTS: MLPA showed two subjects with  typical ASD-associated interstitial duplications of the 15q11-q13 PWA region of  maternal origin. Two additional subjects showed smaller, de novo duplications of the  PWA region that had not been previously characterized. Genes in these two novel  duplications include GABRB3 and ATP10A in one case, and MKRN3, MAGEL2 and NDN in the  other. In addition, two subjects showed duplications of the 22q11/DiGeorge syndrome  region. One individual was found to carry a 12 kb deletion in one copy of the ASPA  gene on 17p13, which when mutated in both alleles leads to Canavan disease. Two  subjects showed partial duplication of the TM4SF2 gene on Xp11.4, previously  implicated in X-linked non-specific mental retardation, but in our subsequent  analyses such variants were also found in controls. A partial duplication in the  ASMT gene, located in the pseudoautosomal region 1 (PAR1) of the sex chromosomes and  previously suggested to be involved in ASD susceptibility, was observed in 6-7% of  the cases but in only 2% of controls (P = 0.003). CONCLUSION: MLPA proves to be an  efficient method to screen for chromosomal abnormalities. We identified duplications  in 15q11-q13 and in 22q11, including new de novo small duplications, as likely  contributing to ASD in the current sample by increasing liability and/or  exacerbating symptoms. Our data indicate that duplications in TM4SF2 are not  associated with the phenotype given their presence in controls. The results in  PAR1/PAR2 are the first large-scale studies of gene dosage in these regions, and the  findings at the ASMT locus indicate that further studies of the duplication of the  ASMT gene are needed in order to gain insight into its potential involvement in ASD.  Our studies also identify some limitations of MLPA, where single base changes in  probe binding sequences alter results. In summary, our studies indicate that MLPA,  with a focus on accepted medical genetic conditions, may be an inexpensive method  for detection of microdeletions and microduplications in ASD patients for purposes  of genetic counselling if MLPA-identified deletions are validated by additional  methods.",

        "Abstract": "The sensitivity of prenatally malnourished rats to the ultrasonic vocalization (USV)  suppressant effect of diazepam (a non-specific benzodiazepine (BZ) receptor agonist)  was investigated. Male offspring of dams provided with a protein deficient diet (6%  casein) for 5 weeks prior to mating and throughout pregnancy were compared to the  offspring of mothers provided with a diet of adequate protein content (25% casein).  At postnatal day 7 or 11, pups were injected with vehicle or one of five doses of DZ  (0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1 or 3mg/kg) 30 min after removal from their dam. Thirty minutes  later they were subjected to 2 min of cooling on a 20 degrees C surface and their  USVs were quantified. DZ dose-dependently suppressed USV at both ages. At P7, the  USV suppressant effect of DZ was the same for both groups. However, by P11 the  prenatally malnourished rats showed significantly greater suppression of USV by 0.03  and 0.1mg/kg DZ than well-nourished controls. These differences were not related to  degree of temperature loss or body weight. Thus, differential sensitivity to BZ  receptor agonists develops in the second postnatal week in prenatally malnourished  rats. This reflects either an altered program of development of the GABAergic  system, or adaptive, compensatory changes in the GABAergic system in response to  more extensive functional disturbances in the developing brain.",

        "Title": "Targeted next-generation sequencing identifies the disruption of the SHANK3 and RYR2  genes in a patient carrying a de novo t(1;22)(q43;q13.3) associated with signs of  Phelan-McDermid syndrome.",
        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: It has been known for more than 30\u2009years that balanced translocations,  especially if de novo, can associate with congenital malformations and / or  neurodevelopmental disorders, following the disruption of a disease gene or its  cis-regulatory elements at one or both breakpoints. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe a  10-year-old girl with a non-specific neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by  moderate intellectual disability (ID), gross motor clumsiness, social and  communication deficits. She carries a de novo reciprocal translocation between  chromosomes 1q43 and 22q13.3, the latter suggesting the involvement of SHANK3.  Indeed, its haploinsufficiency associates with Phelan-McDermid Syndrome, whose main  symptoms are characterized by global developmental delay and absent or severely  delayed expressive speech. A deep molecular approach, including next-generation  sequencing of SHANK3 locus, allowed demonstrating the breakage of RYR2 and SHANK3 on  the derivative chromosomes 1 and 22 respectively, and the formation of two fusion  genes SHANK3-RYR2 and RYR2-SHANK3 with concomitant cryptic deletion of 3.6 and 4.1  kilobases at translocation junction of both derivatives chromosomes 22 and 1,  respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Although the interruption of SHANK3 accounts for the  patient's psychomotor retardation and autism-like behavior, we do not exclude that  the interruption of RYR2 may also have a role on her disorder, or result in further  pathogenicity in the future. Indeed, RYR2 that has a well-established role in the  etiology of two autosomal dominant adulthood cardiac disorders (#600996 and #604772)  is also expressed in the brain (cerebellum, hippocampus, and cerebral cortex) and  about half of RYR2 mutation carriers present late onset primary generalized epilepsy  without cardiac arrhythmogenic disorders. Moreover, RYR2 variants have also been  sporadically reported in individuals with early onset schizophrenia or ID, and its  constraint values suggest intolerance to loss-of-function. This study not only  confirms the usefulness of the molecular mapping of de novo balanced rearrangements  in symptomatic individuals, but also underscores the need for long-term clinical  evaluation of the patients, for better evaluating the pathogenicity of the  chromosomal breakpoints.",

        "Abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Individuals with Down syndrome (DS) show enhanced amyloid beta (A\u03b2)  deposition in the brain. A new positron emission tomography (PET) index of amyloid  load (A\u03b2(L) ) was recently developed as an alternative to standardized uptake value  ratios (SUVrs) to quantify A\u03b2 burden with high sensitivity for detecting and  tracking A\u03b2 change.(1). METHODS: A\u03b2(L) was calculated in a DS cohort (N = 169, mean  age \u00b1 SD = 39.6 \u00b1 8.7 years) using [C-11]Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) PET imaging.  DS-specific PiB templates were created for A\u03b2 carrying capacity (K) and non-specific  binding (NS). RESULTS: The highest values of A\u03b2 carrying capacity were found in the  striatum and precuneus. Longitudinal changes in A\u03b2(L) displayed less variability  when compared to SUVrs. DISCUSSION: These results highlight the utility of A\u03b2(L) for  characterizing A\u03b2 deposition in DS. Rates of A\u03b2 accumulation in DS were found to be  similar to that observed in late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD; \u22483% to 4% per year),  suggesting that AD progression in DS is of earlier onset but not accelerated.",

        "Title": "Phenotypic characterization of individuals with SYNGAP1 pathogenic variants reveals  a potential correlation between posterior dominant rhythm and developmental  progression.",
        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The SYNGAP1 gene encodes for a small GTPase-regulating protein critical  to dendritic spine maturation and synaptic plasticity. Mutations have recently been  identified to cause a breadth of neurodevelopmental disorders including autism,  intellectual disability, and epilepsy. The purpose of this work is to define the  phenotypic spectrum of SYNGAP1 gene mutations and identify potential biomarkers of  clinical severity and developmental progression. METHODS: A retrospective clinical  data analysis of individuals with SYNGAP1 mutations was conducted. Data included  genetic diagnosis, clinical history and examinations, neurophysiologic data,  neuroimaging, and serial neurodevelopmental/behavioral assessments. All patients  were seen longitudinally within a 6-year period; data analysis was completed on June  30, 2018. Records for all individuals diagnosed with deleterious SYNGAP1 variants  (by clinical sequencing or exome sequencing panels) were reviewed. RESULTS: Fifteen  individuals (53% male) with seventeen unique SYNGAP1 mutations are reported. Mean  age at genetic diagnosis was 65.9\u2009months (28-174\u2009months). All individuals had  epilepsy, with atypical absence seizures being the most common semiology (60%). EEG  abnormalities included intermittent rhythmic delta activity (60%), slow or absent  posterior dominant rhythm (87%), and epileptiform activity (93%), with generalized  discharges being more common than focal. Neuroimaging revealed nonspecific  abnormalities (53%). Neurodevelopmental evaluation revealed impairment in all  individuals, with gross motor function being the least affected. Autism spectrum  disorder was diagnosed in 73% and aggression in 60% of cases. Analysis of biomarkers  revealed a trend toward a moderate positive correlation between  visual-perceptual/fine motor/adaptive skills and language development, with  posterior dominant rhythm on electroencephalogram (EEG), independent of age. No  other neurophysiology-development associations or correlations were identified.  CONCLUSIONS: A broad spectrum of neurologic and neurodevelopmental features are  found with pathogenic variants of SYNGAP1. An abnormal posterior dominant rhythm on  EEG correlated with abnormal developmental progression, providing a possible  prognostic biomarker.",

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Clarifying the cause of global developmental and speech delay is of  considerable significance in pediatrics. We present the clinical phenotype of the  22q13 deletion syndrome - also known as Phelan-McDermid syndrome - and show the  diagnostic options. PATIENT: We report on a female patient with muscular hypotonia,  tall stature, minor facial dysmorphism, retarded motor and mental development, and  severe speech delay. METHOD: Chromosomal analysis was performed first on peripheral  lymphocytes on GTG-banded chromosomes. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)  analysis was carried out using the dual-color LSI DiGeorge/VCFS Region Probe  (TUPLE1, N25) (Vysis/Abbott) and the subtelomeric probe tel 22q13.3 (Tel Vysion  22q). RESULTS: The analysis of metaphase chromosomes at 450 band resolution showed a  normal female karyotype 46,XX. FISH analysis revealed a 22q13 deletion. CONCLUSION:  Muscular hypotonia and developmental delay are non-specific findings observed in  many genetic syndromes. In association with severe speech delay and normal or  advanced growth pediatricians should consider 22q13 deletion syndrome as a potential  cause and initiate a genetic examination.",

        "Title": "Clinical, biochemical, and molecular analysis of combined methylmalonic acidemia and  hyperhomocysteinemia (cblC type) in China.",
        "Abstract": "The most common inborn error of cobalamin (cbl) metabolism in China is the cblC type  characterized by combined methylmalonic acidemia and hyperhomocysteinemia. The  clinical presentation is relatively nonspecific, such as feeding difficulty,  recurrent vomiting, hypotonia, lethargy, seizures, progressive developmental delay,  and mental retardation, together with anemia and metabolic acidosis. More specific  biochemical findings include high levels of propionylcarnitine (C3), free carnitine  (C3/C0), and acetylcarnitine (C3/C2) measured by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS),  elevation of methylmalonic acid (MMA) measured by gas chromatography-mass  spectrometry (GC-MS), and increased total homocysteine with normal or decreased  methionine. We report on 50 Chinese patients with combined methylmalonic acidemia  and hyperhomocysteinemia. Forty-six belonged to the cblC complementation group.  Mutation analysis of the MMACHC gene was performed to characterize the mutational  spectrum of cblC deficiency, and 17 different mutations were found. Most were  clustered in exons 3 and 4, accounting for 91.3% of all mutant alleles. Two  mutations were novel, namely, c.315\u00a0C>G (p.Y105X) and c.470\u00a0G>C(p.W157S). In terms  of genotype-phenotype correlation, the c.609\u00a0G>A mutation was associated with  early-onset disease when homozygous. Unlike previous reports from other populations,  c.609\u00a0G>A (p.W203X) was the most frequent cblC mutation detected in our study of  Chinese patients, affecting 51 of 92 MMACHC alleles (55.4%). The high prevalence of  this nonsense mutation could have potential therapeutic significance for Chinese  cblC patients. Besides traditional approaches consisting of hydroxocobalamin  injections, carnitine, betaine, and protein restriction, novel drugs that target  premature termination codons may have a role in the future.",

        "Title": "Clinical and neurological findings of severe vitamin B12 deficiency in infancy and  importance of early diagnosis and treatment.",
        "Abstract": "AIM: Nutritional vitamin B12 deficiency among children in developing countries may  lead to a severe clinical status. In this article, the clinical manifestations of  vitamin B12 deficiency and the consequences of delay in its diagnosis have been  evaluated. METHODS: A total of 41 patients who were hospitalised and treated with  the diagnosis of severe vitamin B12 deficiency in the paediatric haematology  department of the hospital were enrolled in the trial. The diagnosis of severe  vitamin B12 deficiency was based on haematological values, a serum vitamin B12 level  of <100 pg/mL and a normal level of folic acid. Mental, neuro-motor and social  developments of the enrolled patients were assessed by the same physician using the  Ankara Developmental Screening Inventory. RESULTS: The mean age of 25 male and 16  female patients was determined as 12 (6-18 months) months. Almost all of the  children had been fed with breast milk and a poor nutritional state was found in all  of the mothers. Non-specific findings such as growth retardation (78%),  hyperpigmentation of the skin (78%), diarrhoea (63.4%), convulsion (14.6%),  weakness, reluctance to eat, vomiting, irritability and tremor were found in all the  patients, in addition to hypotonia, motor retardation and pallor. Treatment with  vitamin B12 provided recovery in all the patients. The mean age of the patients with  full recovery was 11.7 months, while the mean age of patients with partial recovery  was 12.9 months. CONCLUSION: As a delay in the diagnosis causes irreversible  neurological damage, early diagnosis and treatment is highly important.",

In this study, we describe for the first time a  child with growth retardation in which we identified a balanced t(3;10)  translocation by conventional cytogenetic analysis in addition to an 8.6 Mb 5q12  deletion through array-CGH. Our results show that the phenotypic abnormalities of a  case that had been interpreted as \"balanced\" by conventional cytogenetics are mainly  due to a cryptic deletion, highlighting the need for molecular investigation in  subjects with an abnormal phenotype before assuming the cause is an apparently  simple cytogenetic rearrangement. Finally, we identify PDE4D and PIK3R1 genes as the  two major candidates responsible for the clinical features expressed in our patient.",

        "Title": "A novel homozygous variant in TRAPPC2L results in a neurodevelopmental disorder and  disrupts TRAPP complex function.",
        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Next-generation sequencing has facilitated the diagnosis of  neurodevelopmental disorders with variable and non-specific clinical findings.  Recently, a homozygous missense p.(Asp37Tyr) variant in TRAPPC2L, a core subunit of  TRAPP complexes which function as tethering factors during membrane trafficking, was  reported in two unrelated individuals with neurodevelopmental delay, post-infectious  encephalopathy-associated developmental arrest, tetraplegia and accompanying  rhabdomyolysis. METHODS: We performed whole genome sequencing on members of an  Ashkenazi Jewish pedigree to identify the underlying genetic aetiology of global  developmental delay/intellectual disability in three affected siblings. To assess  the effect of the identified TRAPPC2L variant, we performed biochemical and cell  biological functional studies on the TRAPPC2L protein. RESULTS: A rare homozygous  predicted deleterious missense variant, p.(Ala2Gly), in TRAPPC2L was identified in  the affected siblings and it segregated with the neurodevelopmental phenotype within  the family. Using a yeast two-hybrid assay and in vitro binding, we demonstrate that  the p.(Ala2Gly) variant, but not the p.(Asp37Tyr) variant, disrupted the interaction  between TRAPPC2L and another core TRAPP protein, TRAPPC6a. Size exclusion  chromatography suggested that this variant affects the assembly of TRAPP complexes.  Employing two different membrane trafficking assays using fibroblasts from one of  the affected siblings, we found a delay in traffic into and out of the Golgi.  Similar to the p.(Asp37Tyr) variant, the p.(Ala2Gly) variant resulted in an increase  in the levels of active RAB11. CONCLUSION: Our data fill in a gap in the knowledge  of TRAPP architecture with TRAPPC2L interacting with TRAPPC6a, positioning it as a  putative adaptor for other TRAPP subunits. Collectively, our findings support the  pathogenicity of the TRAPPC2L p.(Ala2Gly) variant.",

        "Title": "Plasma amino acids indicate glioblastoma with ATRX loss.",
        "Abstract": "Glioblastoma (GB) is the most common primary brain tumour in adults. The lack of  molecular biomarker, non-specific symptoms and fast growth rate often result in  a\u00a0significant delay in diagnosis. Despite multimodal treatment, the prognosis  remains poor. Here, we verified the hypothesis that amino acids (AA) regulating the  critical metabolic pathways necessary for maintenance, growth, reproduction, and  immunity of an organism, may constitute a\u00a0favourable target in GB biomarker  research. We measured the plasma amino acids levels in 18\u00a0GB patients and 15  controls and performed the quantitative and qualitative metabolomic analysis of free  AA applying high-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass  spectrometry (LC-QTOF-MS). We present both the raw data and the results of our  statistical analysis. The majority of AA were lowered in the study group in  comparison to the control group. Five of these (arginine, glutamic acid, glutamine,  glycine, and histidine) differed significantly (all p\u2009<\u200910(-5) and AUC\u2009>\u20090.9).  Plasma levels of leucine and phenylalanine decreased in the case of GB with lost  alpha-thalassemia/mental retardation X-linked (ATRX) expression on  immunohistochemistry (p\u2009=\u20090.003 and 0.045, respectively). We demonstrated for the  first time that certain plasma-free AA levels of GB patients were significantly  different from those in healthy volunteers. Target profiling of plasma-free AA,  identified utilizing LC-QTOF-MS, may present prognostic value by indicating GB  patients with lost ATRX expression. The\u00a0on-going quest for glioma biomarkers still  aims to determine the detailed metabolic profile and evaluate its impact on therapy  and prognosis.",

        "Abstract": "Truncating variants in exons 33 and 34 of the SNF2-related CREBBP activator protein  (SRCAP) gene cause the neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD) Floating-Harbor syndrome  (FLHS), characterized by short stature, speech delay, and facial dysmorphism. Here,  we present a cohort of 33 individuals with clinical features distinct from FLHS and  truncating (mostly de novo) SRCAP variants either proximal (n = 28) or distal (n =  5) to the FLHS locus. Detailed clinical characterization of the proximal SRCAP  individuals identified shared characteristics: developmental delay with or without  intellectual disability, behavioral and psychiatric problems, non-specific facial  features, musculoskeletal issues, and hypotonia. Because FLHS is known to be  associated with a unique set of DNA methylation (DNAm) changes in blood, a DNAm  signature, we investigated whether there was a distinct signature associated with  our affected individuals. A machine-learning model, based on the FLHS DNAm  signature, negatively classified all our tested subjects. Comparing proximal  variants with typically developing controls, we identified a DNAm signature distinct  from the FLHS signature. Based on the DNAm and clinical data, we refer to the  condition as \"non-FLHS SRCAP-related NDD.\" All five distal variants classified  negatively using the FLHS DNAm model while two classified positively using the  proximal model. This suggests divergent pathogenicity of these variants, though  clinically the distal group presented with NDD, similar to the proximal SRCAP group.  In summary, for SRCAP, there is a clear relationship between variant location, DNAm  profile, and clinical phenotype. These results highlight the power of combined  epigenetic, molecular, and clinical studies to identify and characterize  genotype-epigenotype-phenotype correlations.",

        "Title": "Mucopolysaccharidosis Type I.",
        "Abstract": "CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) is a progressive  multisystem disorder with features ranging over a continuum of severity. While  affected individuals have traditionally been classified as having one of three MPS I  syndromes (Hurler syndrome, Hurler-Scheie syndrome, or Scheie syndrome), no easily  measurable biochemical differences have been identified and the clinical findings  overlap. Affected individuals are best described as having either a phenotype  consistent with either severe (Hurler syndrome) or attenuated MPS I, a distinction  that influences therapeutic options. Severe MPS I. Infants appear normal at birth.  Typical early manifestations are nonspecific (e.g., umbilical or inguinal hernia,  frequent upper respiratory tract infections before age 1 year). Coarsening of the  facial features may not become apparent until after age one year. Gibbus deformity  of the lower spine is common and often noted within the first year. Progressive  skeletal dysplasia (dysostosis multiplex) involving all bones is universal, as is  progressive arthropathy involving most joints. By age three years, linear growth  decreases. Intellectual disability is progressive and profound but may not be  readily apparent in the first year of life. Progressive cardiorespiratory  involvement, hearing loss, and corneal clouding are common. Without treatment, death  (typically from cardiorespiratory failure) usually occurs within the first ten years  of life. Attenuated MPS I. Clinical onset is usually between ages three and ten  years. The severity and rate of disease progression range from serious  life-threatening complications leading to death in the second to third decade, to a  normal life span complicated by significant disability from progressive joint  manifestations and cardiorespiratory disease. While some individuals have no  neurologic involvement and psychomotor development may be normal in early childhood,  learning disabilities and psychiatric manifestations can be present later in life.  Hearing loss, cardiac valvular disease, respiratory involvement, and corneal  clouding are common. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of MPS I is established in a  proband with suggestive clinical and laboratory findings by: detection of deficient  activity of the lysosomal enzyme \u03b1-L-iduronidase (IDUA) in combination with  elevation of glycosaminoglycan levels; and/or identification of biallelic pathogenic  variants in IDUA on molecular genetic testing. Identification of the causative IDUA  variants plays an important role in the determination of phenotype. MANAGEMENT: An  essential component of management is the determination of whether the proband has  severe or attenuated MPS I. This requires detailed clinical and laboratory  assessment and can be challenging in very young individuals. Treatment of  manifestations: Infant learning programs/special education for developmental delay;  physical therapy, orthopedic surgery as needed, joint replacement for progressive  arthropathy, atlanto-occipital stabilization; spinal cord decompression for cervical  myelopathy; cerebrospinal fluid shunting for hydrocephalus; early median nerve  decompression for carpal tunnel syndrome based on nerve conduction studies before  clinical manifestations develop; special attention to anesthetic risks; hats with  visors/sunglasses to reduce glare, corneal transplantation for ophthalmologic  involvement; cardiac valve replacement as needed and bacterial endocarditis  prophylaxis for those with cardiac involvement; tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy for  eustachian tube dysfunction and/or upper airway obstruction; ventilating tubes;  hearing aids as needed; CPAP for sleep apnea; gastrointestinal management for  diarrhea and constipation. Prevention of primary manifestations: Hematopoietic stem  cell transplantation (HSCT) for children with severe MPS I. Outcome is significantly  influenced by disease burden at the time of diagnosis (and thus, by the age of the  individual). HSCT can improve cognitive outcomes, increase survival, improve growth,  reduce facial coarseness and hepatosplenomegaly, improve hearing, prevent  hydrocephalus, and alter the natural history of cardiac and respiratory  symptomatology. HSCT has lesser effects on the skeletal and joint manifestations,  corneal clouding, and cardiac involvement. HSCT alters the course of cognitive  decline in children with severe MPS I; cognitive outcome is greatly influenced by  the degree of cognitive impairment at the time of transplantation. Due to the  morbidity and mortality associated with HSCT, it is currently recommended primarily  for children with severe MPS I. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with laronidase  (Aldurazyme(\u00ae)), licensed for treatment of the non-CNS manifestations of MPS I,  improves liver size, linear growth, and mobility and joint range of motion; slows  progression of respiratory disease; and improves sleep apnea in persons with  attenuated disease. The age of initiation of ERT influences the outcome.  Surveillance: Annual assessment by a team of physicians with knowledge of the  multisystem nature of MPS I. Specialists and assessments: orthopedic surgery  including annual assessment of median nerve conduction velocity; ophthalmology,  cardiology (including echocardiography), respiratory with assessment of pulmonary  function and sleep studies, audiology, and otolaryngology. Assessment for  constipation and/or hernias as needed. Early and continuous monitoring of head  growth in infants and children with imaging as needed; assessment for evidence of  spinal cord compression by neurologic examination; developmental assessment  annually; and psycho-educational assessment of children with attenuated disease  prior to primary school entry. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Early diagnosis  prior to significant disease manifestations is warranted in relatives at risk in  order to initiate therapy as early in the course of disease as possible. GENETIC  COUNSELING: MPS I is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At conception, each  child of a couple in which both parents are heterozygous for a IDUA pathogenic  variant has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic  carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Carrier testing for  at-risk relatives and prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk are  possible if both disease-causing IDUA variants have been identified in the family.",

        "Title": "De Novo Variants in TAOK1 Cause Neurodevelopmental Disorders.",
        "Abstract": "De novo variants represent a significant cause of neurodevelopmental delay and  intellectual disability. A genetic basis can be identified in only half of  individuals who have neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs); this indicates that  additional causes need to be elucidated. We compared the frequency of de novo  variants in patient-parent trios with (n = 2,030) versus without (n = 2,755) NDDs.  We identified de novo variants in TAOK1 (thousand and one [TAO] amino acid kinase  1), which encodes the serine/threonine-protein kinase TAO1, in three individuals  with NDDs but not in persons who did not have NDDs. Through further screening and  the use of GeneMatcher, five additional individuals with NDDs were found to have de  novo variants. All eight variants were absent from gnomAD (Genome Aggregation  Database). The variant carriers shared a non-specific phenotype of developmental  delay, and six individuals had additional muscular hypotonia. We established a  fibroblast line of one mutation carrier, and we demonstrated that reduced mRNA  levels of TAOK1 could be increased upon cycloheximide treatment. These results  indicate nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Further, there was neither detectable  phosphorylated TAO1 kinase nor phosphorylated tau in these cells, and mitochondrial  morphology was altered. Knockdown of the ortholog gene Tao1 (Tao, CG14217) in  Drosophila resulted in delayed early development. The majority of the Tao1-knockdown  flies did not survive beyond the third instar larval stage. When compared to control  flies, Tao1 knockdown flies revealed changed morphology of the ventral nerve cord  and the neuromuscular junctions as well as a decreased number of endings (boutons).  Furthermore, mitochondria in mutant flies showed altered distribution and decreased  size in axons of motor neurons. Thus, we provide compelling evidence that de novo  variants in TAOK1 cause NDDs.",

        "Title": "Persistent idiopathic hyperphosphatasemia from bone alkaline phosphatase in a  healthy boy.",
        "Abstract": "Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in humans comprises a family of four cell-surface  phosphomonoester phosphohydrolase isozymes. Three genes separately encode the  \"tissue-specific\" ALPs whereas the fourth gene encodes ubiquitous homodimeric  \"tissue-nonspecific\" ALP (TNSALP) richly expressed in bone, liver, kidney, and  developing teeth. TNSALP monomers have five putative N-linked glycosylation sites  where different post-translational modifications account for this isozyme's  distinctive physicochemical properties in different organs. Three bone-derived  TNSALP (BALP) isoforms (B/I, B1, and B2) are present in healthy serum, whereas a  fourth BALP isoform (B1x) can circulate in chronic kidney disease. Herein, we report  a healthy boy with persistent hyperphosphatasemia due to BALP levels two- to  threefold higher than age-appropriate reference values. High-performance liquid  chromatography, electrophoresis, heat inactivation, catalysis inhibition, and  polyethylene glycol precipitation revealed increased serum B/I, B1, and B2 differing  from patterns found in skeletal diseases. B/I was ~23-fold elevated. Absence of  mental retardation and physical stigmata excluded Mabry syndrome, the ALP-anchoring  disorder causing hyperphosphatasemia. Routine biochemical studies indicated intact  mineral homeostasis. Serum N-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen (P1NP) level  was normal, but C-terminal cross-linking telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX) level  was elevated. However, radiological studies showed no evidence for a generalized  skeletal disturbance. Circulating pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, a TNSALP natural  substrate, was not low despite the laboratory hyperphosphatasemia, thereby  suggesting BALP phosphohydrolase activity was not elevated endogenously. Mutation  analysis of the ALPL gene encoding TNSALP revealed no defect. His non-consanguineous  healthy parents had serum total ALP activity and BALP protein levels that were  normal. Our patient's sporadic idiopathic hyperphosphatasemia could reflect altered  post-translational modification together with increased expression and/or impaired  degradation of BALP.",

        "Abstract": "De novo variants in QRICH1 (Glutamine-rich protein 1) has recently been reported in  11 individuals with intellectual disability (ID). The function of QRICH1 is largely  unknown but it is likely to play a key role in the unfolded response of endoplasmic  reticulum stress through transcriptional control of proteostasis. In this study, we  present 27 additional individuals and delineate the clinical and molecular spectrum  of the individuals (n\u2009=\u200938) with QRICH1 variants. The main clinical features were  mild to moderate developmental delay/ID (71%), nonspecific facial dysmorphism (92%)  and hypotonia (39%). Additional findings included poor weight gain (29%), short  stature (29%), autism spectrum disorder (29%), seizures (24%) and scoliosis (18%).  Minor structural brain abnormalities were reported in 52% of the individuals with  brain imaging. Truncating or splice variants were found in 28 individuals and 10 had  missense variants. Four variants were inherited from mildly affected parents. This  study confirms that heterozygous QRICH1 variants cause a neurodevelopmental disorder  including short stature and expands the phenotypic spectrum to include poor weight  gain, scoliosis, hypotonia, minor structural brain anomalies, and seizures.  Inherited variants from mildly affected parents are reported for the first time,  suggesting variable expressivity.",

        "Title": "[Psychiatric disorders in adult form of Niemann-Pick disease type C].",
        "Abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Niemann-Pick type C disease (NPC) is a rare genetic disease with an  extremely heterogeneous clinical presentation. The adult form of this disease is  usually expressed with neurological symptoms; however, non-specific psychiatric  disorders are often associated. This article presents a retrospective study on a  cohort of NPC patients diagnosed in France with the objectives of researching the  presence of psychiatric disorders and qualifying these disorders. METHODS: After  carrying out a research within hospital records, a questionnaire was sent to  patients or their relatives and their doctors. RESULTS: The cohort was made up of  22\u00a0patients. Fifty-two questionnaires were sent to 47\u00a0different doctors. We received  67% of answers from the doctors, with 42% of positive answers. The answer rate of  the families was 27%. Among the 22\u00a0patients, we found the presence of psychiatric  disorders in 86% of cases. Seventy-three percent of the patients presented behavior  disorders. Among them, 27% exhibited psychomotor excitation or agitation, 23%  aggressiveness, 18% intolerance to frustration, 27% sleep disorders and 23% apathy,  listlessness and/or clinophilia. Fifty-five percent of patients presented psychotic  symptoms, with 45% with delusions and 36% with hallucinations. Seventy-seven percent  of patients presented with mood disorders: 36% suffered from depression and 27% from  emotional lability or mood swings. Of the 22\u00a0patients, a diagnosis of psychiatric  disease was made in 50% of cases. The main diagnoses were schizophrenia (27%) and  depression (23%). The other diagnoses identified were acute delirium, dysthymia,  infantile psychosis, intellectual disharmonic disability and personality disorder.  The average age of emergence of the troubles was 17.1\u00a0years old for neurological  symptoms and 20.9\u00a0years old for psychiatric symptoms. The median age was 18\u00a0years  old for neurological symptoms and 20\u00a0years old for psychiatric ones. In 45% of  cases, psychiatric occurred after neurological symptoms; in 27%, they occurred  before and they were concomitant in 9%. In 50% of cases, psychiatric symptoms  existed before the early diagnosis of NPC; in 9%, they occurred after and in 5%,  they occurred during the diagnostic process. Fifty-five percent of the patients were  followed by a psychiatrist, 50% of patients had been hospitalized at least once in a  psychiatric department. Fifty-five percent of the patients received neuroleptics or  antipsychotics, 41% received antidepressants, 41% received mood stabilizers or  anticonvulsants, 45% received anxiolytics and 23% hypnotics. DISCUSSION: Whilst a  small cohort, the low incidence of NPC (1/120,000\u00a0to 1/150,000) and the scale of a  single-center study make the findings important. In our cohort, we found psychiatric  disorders in most of the patients. The symptoms were varied and non-specific, and  mainly found in late-onset forms of the disease. This incidence of disorder is much  higher than the literature suggests, generally describing psychiatric disorders in  approximately one third of NPC adult form. On the other hand, our results on  schizophrenia are consistent with the updated recommendations for the diagnosis and  management of NPC. According to our results, a retrospective study to develop a  suspicion index to aid diagnosis of NPC suggests that psychotic symptoms are  underestimated in this disease. In our cohort, we also found a significant rate of  psychiatric hospitalizations and psychotropic drugs prescription that had not been  previously described in the international literature. We did not have sufficient  data on the effectiveness of symptomatic treatment in NPC; the literature was  contradictory. It should be noted that despite the high rate of psychiatric patients  in our cohort, only half of patients consulted a psychiatrist and a few of them have  regular follow-up. To conclude, our study is in line with the current literature  that suggests an under-estimation of psychiatric disorders in NPC, but also a likely  under-diagnosis of NPC in psychiatric departments. All this data encourage us to  keep alerting psychiatrists to identifying this disease in order to promote early  and optimal care.",

        "Title": "The many faces of peroxisomal disorders: Lessons from a large Arab cohort.",
        "Abstract": "Defects in the peroxisomes biogenesis and/or function result in peroxisomal  disorders. In this study, we describe the largest Arab cohort to date (72 families)  of clinically, biochemically and molecularly characterized patients with peroxisomal  disorders. At the molecular level, we identified 43 disease-causing variants, half  of which are novel. The founder nature of many of the variants allowed us to  calculate the minimum disease burden for these disorders in our population  ~1:30\u2009000, which is much higher than previous estimates in other populations.  Clinically, we found an interesting trend toward genotype/phenotype correlation in  terms of long-term survival. Nearly half (40/75) of our peroxisomal disorders  patients had documented survival beyond 1 year of age. Most unusual among the  long-term survivors was a multiplex family in which the affected members presented  as adults with non-specific intellectual disability and epilepsy. Other unusual  presentations included the very recently described peroxisomal fatty acyl-CoA  reductase 1 disorder as well as CRD, spastic paraparesis, white matter (CRSPW)  syndrome. We conclude that peroxisomal disorders are highly heterogeneous in their  clinical presentation. Our data also confirm the demonstration that milder forms of  Zellweger spectrum disorders cannot be ruled out by the \"gold standard\" very long  chain fatty acids assay, which highlights the value of a genomics-first approach in  these cases.",

        "Title": "[Abnormal findings during newborn period of 160 patients with early-onset  methylmalonic aciduria].",
        "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Methylmalonic aciduria is the most common disorder of organic acidurias  in the mainland of China. It is also the one of treatable metabolic disorders. The  clinical spectrum of the patients varies from severe neonatal-onset forms with  neonatal brain injury and high mortality to milder forms with adult-onset. The  clinical manifestations of neonates with methylmalonic aciduria are non-specific.  Early diagnosis and adequate treatment contribute a lot to improving the prognosis  of the patients. In this study, the abnormal clinical and laboratory findings in  neonatal period of 160 Chinese patients with early-onset methylmalonic aciduria were  investigated. METHOD: From 1996 to 2011, a total of 398 patients with methylmalonic  aciduria were diagnosed in our hospital; 286 (71.9%) patients had early-onset before  1 year of age. Among 286 patients, 160 (55.9%) presented symptoms in neonatal  period. Their urine organic acids were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass  spectrometry. Blood amino acids and acylcarnitine profiles were determined by liquid  chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Serum and urine total homocysteine were  measured using a fluorescence polarization immunoassay. In some patients, gene  analysis was performed. Based on the disease types and general condition, individual  dietary and medical interventions were started soon after diagnosis. RESULT: Out of  the 160 patients, 131 (81.9%) had combined methylmalonic aciduria and  homocysteinemia. Isolated methylmalonic aciduria was found in 29 cases (18.1%). The  common presentations in neonatal period were feeding difficulty, seizures, lethargy  and dyspnea. Megaloblastic anemia, liver dysfunction, hyperammonemia and metabolic  acidosis were the frequent findings in the routine laboratory test. The most common  initial clinical diagnosis was suspected hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. Even in 36  cases with abnormal family history, only 3 patients were admitted with suspected  inborn errors of metabolism. Five cases (3.1%) were diagnosed by postmortem  metabolic examination; 7 cases (4.4%) were detected by newborn screening. In 148  cases (92.5%), the diagnosis was much delayed to the age of one month to 8 years and  5 months (mean 13 months). Methylmalonic aciduria combined with homocysteinemia  (MMACHC) gene analyses were performed in 31 cases with combined methylmalonic  aciduria. CblC defect was confirmed. The patients with isolated methylmalonic  aciduria were treated with protein-restricted diet, cobalamin and L-carnitine. The  patients of methylmalonic aciduria combined with homocysteinemia were treated with  cobalamin, L-carnitine, calcium folinate, betaine and common diet. Seven patients  died without treatment. Clinical improvement was observed in 153 patients. Only 2  patients detected by newborn screening had normal mental and physical development.  Mild to severe psychomotor retardation was observed in 151 cases. CONCLUSION: High  mortality and disability rates were observed in the patients with early-onset  methylmalonic aciduria. Combined methylmalonic aciduria and homocysteinemia is the  common type of methylmalonic aciduria. The clinical manifestation in neonatal period  of the patients with early-onset methylmalonic aciduria is complex. Feeding  difficulty, seizures, lethargy and dyspnea are the common symptoms in neonatal  period of the patients. Megaloblastic anemia, liver dysfunction, hyperammonemia and  metabolic acidosis were the frequent laboratory findings.",
