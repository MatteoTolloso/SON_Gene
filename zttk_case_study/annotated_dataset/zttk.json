        "Abstract": "Zhu-Tokita-Takenouchi-Kim (ZTTK) syndrome is caused by de novo loss-of-function  variants in the SON gene (MIM #617140). This multisystemic disorder is characterized  by intellectual disability, seizures, abnormal brain imaging, variable dysmorphic  features, and various congenital anomalies. The wide application and increasing  accessibility of whole exome sequencing (WES) has helped to identify new cases of  ZTTK syndrome over the last few years. To date, there have been approximately 45  cases reported in the literature. Here, we describe 15 additional individuals with  variants in the SON gene, including those with missense variants bringing the total  number of known cases to 60. We have reviewed the clinical and molecular data of  these new cases and all previously reported cases to further delineate the most  common as well as emerging clinical findings related to this syndrome. Furthermore,  we aim to delineate any genotype-phenotype correlations specifically for a recurring  pathogenic four base pair deletion (c.5753_5756del) along with discussing the impact  of missense variants seen in the SON gene.",

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The present study aims to summarize the clinical and genetic  characteristics of ZTTK syndrome. METHODS: The clinical and genetic data of a  Chinese girl with severe growth and development delay, intellectual disability, and  facial features were analyzed. Original articles on ZTTK syndrome published up to  November 20l8 were identified from PubMed, Human Gene Mutation Database, Online  Mendelian Inheritance in Man, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and WanFang  databases using the keywords \"ZTTK syndrome\" and \"SON\". RESULTS: The patient was  born small for gestational age, and had poor academic performance, delayed language  development, and motor retardation. The patient's height was 113\u00a0cm (less than -3  SD), and had moles on the back skin and possessed facial features. A novel  heterozygous mutation c.394C>T (p.Q132X) of SON was found in this patient, but the  parents were normal. CONCLUSION: The patient's clinical phenotype was consistent  with ZTTK syndrome. The novel heterozygous mutation c.394C>T (p.Q132X) of SON was  its pathogenic mutation, which has not been reported at home and abroad.",

        "Title": "Establishing the phenotypic spectrum of ZTTK syndrome by analysis of 52 individuals  with variants in SON.",
        "Abstract": "Zhu-Tokita-Takenouchi-Kim (ZTTK) syndrome, an intellectual disability syndrome first  described in 2016, is caused by heterozygous loss-of-function variants in SON. Its  encoded protein promotes pre-mRNA splicing of many genes essential for development.  Whereas individual phenotypic traits have previously been linked to erroneous  splicing of SON target genes, the phenotypic spectrum and the pathogenicity of  missense variants have not been further evaluated. We present the phenotypic  abnormalities in 52 individuals, including 17 individuals who have not been reported  before. In total, loss-of-function variants were detected in 49 individuals (de novo  in 47, inheritance unknown in 2), and in 3, a missense variant was observed (2 de  novo, 1 inheritance unknown). Phenotypic abnormalities, systematically collected and  analyzed in Human Phenotype Ontology, were found in all organ systems. Significant  inter-individual phenotypic variability was observed, even in individuals with the  same recurrent variant (n\u2009=\u200913). SON haploinsufficiency was previously shown to lead  to downregulation of downstream genes, contributing to specific phenotypic features.  Similar functional analysis for one missense variant, however, suggests a different  mechanism than for heterozygous loss-of-function. Although small in numbers and  while pathogenicity of these variants is not certain, these data allow for  speculation whether de novo missense variants cause ZTTK syndrome via another  mechanism, or a separate overlapping syndrome. In conclusion, heterozygous  loss-of-function variants in SON define a recognizable syndrome, ZTTK, associated  with a broad, severe phenotypic spectrum, characterized by a large inter-individual  variability. These observations provide essential information for affected  individuals, parents, and healthcare professionals to ensure appropriate clinical  management.",

        "Abstract": "Zhu-Tokita-Takenouchi-Kim (ZTTK) syndrome, a rare congenital anomaly syndrome  characterized by intellectual disability, brain malformation, facial dysmorphism,  musculoskeletal abnormalities, and some visceral malformations is caused by de novo  heterozygous mutations of the SON gene. The nuclear protein SON is involved in gene  transcription and RNA splicing; however, the roles of SON in neural development  remain undetermined. We investigated the effects of Son knockdown on neural  development in mice and found that Son knockdown in neural progenitors resulted in  defective migration during corticogenesis and reduced spine density on mature  cortical neurons. The induction of human wild-type SON expression rescued these  neural abnormalities, confirming that the abnormalities were caused by SON  insufficiency. We also applied truncated SON proteins encoded by disease-associated  mutant SON genes for rescue experiments and found that a truncated SON protein  encoded by the most prevalent SON mutant found in ZTTK syndrome rescued the neural  abnormalities while another much shorter mutant SON protein did not. These data  indicate that SON insufficiency causes neuronal migration defects and dendritic  spine abnormalities, which seem neuropathological bases of the neural symptoms of  ZTTK syndrome. In addition, the results support that the neural abnormalities in  ZTTK syndrome are caused by SON haploinsufficiency independent of the types of  mutation that results in functional or dysfunctional proteins.",

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The genetic etiology of intellectual and psychomotor disability without  a defined spectrum of dysmorphic features is usually monogenic. As no diagnostic  criteria for such diseases are established, the clinical diagnosis becomes to be a  challenge. The object of our paper is to present two patients with non-specific  clinical symptoms for whom whole-exome-sequencing identified the new SON mutations  and thus allowed for establishing the diagnosis of Zhu-Tokita-Takenouchi-Kim (ZTTK)  syndrome. In both patients, the same symptoms including hypotonia, developmental and  speech delay, feeding difficulties as well as frequent infections of the respiratory  tract and internal ear were observed. However, both cases presented also with  exceptional symptoms such as in case 1 ventriculomegaly and asymmetry of ventricles,  hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS), intellectual disability, intestinal  malrotation, gastroparesis, and duodenal atresia and in the case 2 febrile seizures  and reduced IgA levels. We will be presenting the patients and comparing them to 30  previously described cases. METHODS: Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed on  the probands' DNA and paired-end sequenced (2x100\u00a0bp) on HiSeq 1500. Variants  considered as disease-causing were validated in the proband and studied in all  available family members by amplicon deep sequencing performed using Nextera XT Kit  and sequenced on HiSeq 1500. RESULTS: We have identified two new variants in SON  gene. In case 1 it has been a heterozygous frameshift variant p.(Ala1340GlnfsTer26),  while in case 2 it has been a heterozygous frameshift variant, p.(Asp1640GlyfsTer7).  Both variants are described for the first time and up to now, are not mentioned in  any database. CONCLUSION: As there are no precise criteria established for the  clinical diagnosis of ZTTK, an identification of SON gene mutation by  whole-exome-sequencing is the best method that allows for a diagnosis of this  syndrome.",

There are only 33 cases and 26 causative SON  variants reported to date since the first report in 2015. Here, we report a new case  of ZTTK syndrome and a de novo disease-causing SON variant. METHODS: We conducted  whole-exome sequencing (WES) to obtain genetic data of the patient. The clinical and  genetic data of the patient were analyzed. RESULTS: The clinical features of our  patient were strikingly similar to previously reported cases. Notably, our patient  had unique presentations, including a bridged palmar crease in the left hand and  growth hormone deficiency. The c.5297del de novo variant in SON causes an amino  change (p.Ser1766Leufs*7). CONCLUSION: Our report expands the mutant spectrum of the  SON gene and refines the genotype-phenotype map of ZTTK syndrome. Our findings also  highlighted the importance of WES for early diagnosis of ZTTK syndrome, which may  improve diagnostic procedures for affected individuals.",

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: With the rapid development of genetic detection technology, especially  next-generation sequencing, identification of the aetiology of unexplained  intellectual disabilities accompanied by seizures and other dysmorphic features has  become possible. The purpose of our paper is to make a definitive diagnosis of a  girl with neonatal hypotonia, severe global developmental delay, seizures and mild  facial dysmorphism. METHODS: The clinical data of the patient were retrospectively  studied. Whole-exome sequencing was performed on a blood sample from the patient.  Subsequently, Sanger sequencing was utilized for validation of variants and parental  validation. RESULTS: The patient had hypotonia since the neonatal period. She showed  a significant delay in physical and psychomotor development. She did not have any  speech until the age of 2\u00a0years and 6\u00a0months. She had seizures that were easy to  control with levetiracetam. The craniocerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) then  showed mild delayed myelination, enlarged bilateral ventricles and widened  frontotemporal extracerebral space. Interictal video electroencephalogram (VEEG) was  normal. She had esotropia and mild facial abnormalities with a flat nasal bridge and  a short nose. She showed no abnormalities in the heart, genitourinary or skeletal  systems. Whole-exome sequencing revealed a novel de novo variant c.5334_5335delAG  (p. Arg1778Serfs*11) in the SON gene. CONCLUSION: Our paper reports a novel variant  in the SON gene and provides a definitive diagnosis of a female with neonatal  hypotonia, severe global developmental delay, seizures and mild facial  abnormalities, which are symptoms consistent with Zhu-Tokita-Takenouchi-Kim syndrome  (ZTTK syndrome).",
