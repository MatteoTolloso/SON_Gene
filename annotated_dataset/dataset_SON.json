        "Title": "Dbp5/DDX19 between Translational Readthrough and Nonsense Mediated Decay.",
        "Abstract": "The DEAD-box protein Dbp5 (human DDX19) remodels RNA-protein complexes. Dbp5  functions in ribonucleoprotein export and translation termination. Termination  occurs, when the ribosome has reached a stop codon through the Dbp5 mediated  delivery of the eukaryotic termination factor eRF1. eRF1 contacts eRF3 upon  dissociation of Dbp5, resulting in polypeptide chain release and subsequent  ribosomal subunit splitting. Mutations in DBP5 lead to stop codon readthrough,  because the eRF1 and eRF3 interaction is not controlled and occurs prematurely. This  identifies Dbp5/DDX19 as a possible potent drug target for nonsense suppression  therapy. Neurodegenerative diseases and cancer are caused in many cases by the loss  of a gene product, because its mRNA contained a premature termination codon (PTC)  and is thus eliminated through the nonsense mediated decay (NMD) pathway, which is  described in the second half of this review. We discuss translation termination and  NMD in the light of Dbp5/DDX19 and subsequently speculate on reducing Dbp5/DDX19  activity to allow readthrough of the PTC and production of a full-length protein to  detract the RNA from NMD as a possible treatment for diseases.",

        "Abstract": "Nuclear speckles (NS) are among the most prominent biomolecular condensates. Despite  their prevalence, research on the function of NS is virtually restricted to  colocalization analyses, since an organizing core, without which NS cannot form,  remains unidentified. The monoclonal antibody SC35, raised against a spliceosomal  extract, is frequently used to mark NS. Unexpectedly, we found that this antibody  was mischaracterized and the main target of SC35 mAb is SRRM2, a  spliceosome-associated protein that sharply localizes to NS. Here we show that, the  core of NS is likely formed by SON and SRRM2, since depletion of SON leads only to a  partial disassembly of NS, while co-depletion of SON and SRRM2 or depletion of SON  in a cell-line where intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) of SRRM2 are  genetically deleted, leads to a near-complete dissolution of NS. This work,  therefore, paves the way to study the role of NS under diverse physiological and  stress conditions.",

        "Abstract": "Telomere length control is critical for cellular lifespan and tumor suppression.  Telomerase is transiently activated in the inner cell mass of the developing  blastocyst to reset telomere reserves. Its silencing upon differentiation leads to  gradual telomere shortening in somatic cells. Here, we report that transcriptional  regulation through cis-regulatory elements only partially accounts for telomerase  activation in pluripotent cells. Instead, developmental control of telomerase is  primarily driven by an alternative splicing event, centered around hTERT exon 2.  Skipping of exon 2 triggers hTERT mRNA decay in differentiated cells, and  conversely, its retention promotes telomerase accumulation in pluripotent cells. We  identify SON as a regulator of exon 2 alternative splicing and report a patient  carrying a SON mutation and suffering from insufficient telomerase and short  telomeres. In summary, our study highlights a critical role for hTERT alternative  splicing in the developmental regulation of telomerase and implicates defective  splicing in telomere biology disorders.",

        "Abstract": "The DEAD-box protein (DBP) Dbp5, a member of the superfamily II (SFII) helicases,  has multiple reported roles in gene expression. First identified as an essential  regulator of mRNA export in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the enzyme now has reported  functions in non-coding RNA export, translation, transcription, and DNA metabolism.  Localization of the protein to various cellular compartments (nucleoplasm, nuclear  envelope, and cytoplasm) highlights the ability of Dbp5 to modulate different stages  of the RNA lifecycle. While Dbp5 has been well studied for\u2009>\u200920\u00a0years, several  critical questions remain regarding the mechanistic principles that govern Dbp5  localization, substrate selection, and functions in gene expression. This review  aims to take a holistic view of the proposed functions of Dbp5 and evaluate models  that accommodate current published data.",

        "Abstract": "The DEAD-box RNA helicase Dbp5 is an essential and conserved mRNA export factor  which functions in the ATP dependent remodeling of RNA/protein complexes. As such it  displaces mRNA bound proteins at the cytoplasmic site of the nuclear pore complex.  For the regulation of its RNA-dependent ATPase activity during late steps of nuclear  transport, Dbp5 requires the nucleoporin Nup159 and its cofactors Gle1 and IP6. In  addition to its role in mRNA export, a second important function of Dbp5 was  identified in translation termination, where it acts together with eRF1 once the  translation machinery has reached the stop codon. Similar to mRNA export, this  function also requires Gle1-IP6, however, the counterpart of Nup159 is still  missing. Potential other functions of the nucleo-cytoplasmic protein Dbp5 are  discussed as well as its substrate specificity and details in its regulatory cycle  that are based on recent biochemical and structural characterization.

        "Title": "Dbp5, Gle1-IP6 and Nup159: a working model for mRNP export.",
        "Abstract": "Gene expression is a stepwise process involving distinct cellular processes  including transcription, mRNA (mRNA) processing, mRNA export, and translation. As  mRNAs are being synthesized, proteins associate with the RNA to form messenger  ribonucleoprotein particles (mRNPs). Previous studies have demonstrated that the  RNA-binding protein composition of these mRNPs is dynamic, changing as the mRNP  moves through the different steps of gene expression, and playing a critical role in  these events. An important step during this maturation process occurs at the  cytoplasmic face of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) where the export protein Gle1  bound to inositol hexakisphosphate (IP 6) spatially activates the ATP-hydrolysis and  mRNP-remodeling activity of the DEAD-box protein Dbp5. Recent work from our  laboratory and others has provided important insights into the function and  regulation of Dbp5. These include a more detailed explanation of the mechanism of  Dbp5 RNP remodeling, the role of Gle1-IP6 in stimulating Dbp5 ATPase activity, and  the identification of a novel paradigm for regulation of Dbp5 by Nup159. Based on in  vitro biochemical assays, X-ray crystallography, and corresponding in vivo  phenotypes, we propose here an updated model of the Dbp5 cycle during mRNP export  through the NPC. This takes into account all available data and provides a platform  for future studies.",

        "Abstract": "The overall understanding of the molecular etiologies of intellectual disability  (ID) and developmental delay (DD) is increasing as next-generation sequencing  technologies identify genetic variants in individuals with such disorders. However,  detailed analyses conclusively confirming these variants, as well as the underlying  molecular mechanisms explaining the diseases, are often lacking. Here, we report on  an ID syndrome caused by de novo heterozygous loss-of-function (LoF) mutations in  SON. The syndrome is characterized by ID and/or DD, malformations of the cerebral  cortex, epilepsy, vision problems, musculoskeletal abnormalities, and congenital  malformations. Knockdown of son in zebrafish resulted in severe malformation of the  spine, brain, and eyes. Importantly, analyses of RNA from affected individuals  revealed that genes critical for neuronal migration and cortex organization (TUBG1,  FLNA, PNKP, WDR62, PSMD3, and\u00a0HDAC6) and metabolism (PCK2, PFKL, IDH2, ACY1, and  ADA) are significantly downregulated because of the accumulation of mis-spliced  transcripts resulting from erroneous SON-mediated RNA splicing. Our data highlight  SON as a master regulator governing neurodevelopment and demonstrate the importance  of SON-mediated RNA splicing in human development.",

        "Title": "Dbp5 associates with RNA-bound Mex67 and Nab2 and its localization at the nuclear  pore complex is sufficient for mRNP export and cell viability.",
        "Abstract": "In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the mRNA export receptor Mex67 is recruited to mature  nuclear transcripts to mediate mRNA export through the nuclear pore complex (NPC) to  the cytoplasm. Mex67 binds transcripts through adaptor proteins such as the poly(A)  binding protein Nab2. When a transcript reaches the cytoplasmic face of the NPC, the  DEAD-box protein Dbp5 acts to induce a local structural change to release Nab2 and  Mex67 in an essential process termed mRNP remodeling. It is unknown how certain  proteins (Nab2, Mex67) are released during Dbp5-mediated mRNP remodeling, whereas  others remain associated. Here, we demonstrate that Dbp5 associates in close  proximity with Mex67 and Nab2 in a cellular complex. Further, fusion of Dbp5 to  Nup159 anchors Dbp5 at the cytoplasmic face of the NPC and is sufficient for cell  viability. Thus, we speculate that the essential role of Dbp5 in remodeling  exporting mRNPs requires its localization to the NPC and is separable from other  subcellular functions of Dbp5. This work supports a model where the diverse nuclear,  cytoplasmic and NPC functions of Dbp5 in the mRNA lifecycle are not interdependent  and that Dbp5 is locally recruited through complex protein-protein interactions to  select regions of transcripts for specific removal of transport proteins at the NPC.",

        "Title": "Nup159 Weakens Gle1 Binding to Dbp5 But Does Not Accelerate ADP Release.",
        "Abstract": "Dbp5, DDX19 in humans, is an essential DEAD-box protein involved in mRNA export,  which has also been linked to other cellular processes, including rRNA export and  translation. Dbp5 ATPase activity is regulated by several factors, including RNA,  the nucleoporin proteins Nup159 and Gle1, and the endogenous small-molecule inositol  hexakisphosphate (InsP(6)). To better understand how these factors modulate Dbp5  activity and how this modulation relates to in vivo RNA metabolism, a detailed  characterization of the Dbp5 mechanochemical cycle in the presence of those  regulators individually or together is necessary. In this study, we test the  hypothesis that Nup159 controls the ADP-bound state of Dbp5. In addition, the  contributions of Mg(2+) to the kinetics and thermodynamics of ADP binding to Dbp5  were assessed. Using a solution based in vitro approach, Mg(2+) was found to slow  ADP and ATP release from Dbp5 and increased the overall ADP and ATP affinities, as  observed with other NTPases. Furthermore, Nup159 did not accelerate ADP release,  while Gle1 actually slowed ADP release independent of Mg(2+). These findings are not  consistent with Nup159 acting as a nucleotide exchange factor to promote ADP release  and Dbp5 ATPase cycling. Instead, in the presence of Nup159, the interaction between  Gle1 and ADP-bound Dbp5 was found to be reduced by ~18-fold, suggesting that Nup159  alters the Dbp5-Gle1 interaction to aid Gle1 release from Dbp5.",

        "Abstract": "Transduction of developmental and environmental cues into the nucleus to induce  transcription and the export of RNAs to the cytoplasm through the nuclear pore  complex (NPC) play pivotal roles in regulation of gene expression. The process of  bulk export of mRNAs from nucleus to cytoplasm is highly conserved across  eukaryotes. Assembly of export-competent mRNA ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) is coupled  with both transcription and mRNA processing. The export-competent mRNP consists of  mRNAs and a dozen nucleocytoplasmic shuttling nuclear proteins, including RNA export  factors (Mex67-Mtr2 heterodimer, Npl3), poly(A)-binding proteins, DEAD-box protein 5  (Dbp5), and nucleoporins (NUPs) in yeast. Mobile NUPs help docking of mRNP to the  NPC nuclear basket. A partially unfolded mRNP complex appears to be pulled through  the NPC by using energy from Dbp5-catalyzed ATP hydrolysis. Dbp5 probably catalyzes  the release of mRNA from mRNP in the cytoplasm. In contrast to bulk export of mRNAs  by a Mex67-Mtr2/Npl3-dependent pathway, a specific subset of mRNA export under  stress and export of microRNAs are mediated through the karyopherin (importin beta)  family of proteins in a Ran-GTPase-dependent pathway. Our knowledge of mRNA export  mechanisms in flowering plants is in its infancy. Some proteins of the NUP107-160  complex, NUPs and DEAD-box proteins (DBPs), have been studied in flowering plants.  Arabidopsis NUP160/SAR1 plays a critical role in mRNA export, regulation of  flowering, and hormone and abiotic stress responses, whereas NUP96/ SAR3/MOS3 is  required for mRNA export to modulate hormonal and biotic stress responses. DEAD-box  proteins have been implicated in mRNA export and abiotic stress response of yeast  and higher plants. Arabidopsis DBP CRYOPHYTE/LOS4 plays an important role in mRNA  export, abiotic stress response, germination, and plant development. Further studies  on various components of nuclear mRNA export in plants during nonstress and stress  conditions will be necessary to understand the link between mRNA export and  stress-responsive gene expression.",

        "Title": "Mechanisms of nuclear mRNA export: A structural perspective.",
        "Abstract": "Export of mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm is a critical process for all  eukaryotic gene expression. As mRNA is synthesized, it is packaged with a myriad of  RNA-binding proteins to form ribonucleoprotein particles (mRNPs). For each step in  the processes of maturation and export, mRNPs must have the correct complement of  proteins. Much of the mRNA export pathway revolves around the heterodimeric export  receptor yeast Mex67\u2022Mtr2/human NXF1\u2022NXT1, which is recruited to signal the  completion of nuclear mRNP assembly, mediates mRNP targeting/translocation through  the nuclear pore complex (NPC), and is displaced at the cytoplasmic side of the NPC  to release the mRNP into the cytoplasm. Directionality of the transport is governed  by at least two DEAD-box ATPases, yeast Sub2/human UAP56 in the nucleus and yeast  Dbp5/human DDX19 at the cytoplasmic side of the NPC, which respectively mediate the  association and dissociation of Mex67\u2022Mtr2/NXF1\u2022NXT1 onto the mRNP. Here we review  recent progress from structural studies of key constituents in different steps of  nuclear mRNA export. These findings have laid the foundation for further studies to  obtain a comprehensive mechanistic view of the mRNA export pathway.",

Dbp5 also  shuttles between nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments with reported roles in  transcription, ribosomal subunit export, and translation; however, the mechanism(s)  by which nucleocytoplasmic transport occurs and how Dbp5 specifically contributes to  each of these processes remains unclear. Towards understanding the functions and  transport of Dbp5 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, alanine scanning mutagenesis was used  to generate point mutants at all possible residues within a GFP-Dbp5 reporter.  Characterization of the 456 viable mutants led to the identification of an  N-terminal Xpo1-dependent nuclear export signal in Dbp5, in addition to other  separation-of-function alleles, which together provide evidence that Dbp5 nuclear  shuttling is not essential for mRNP export. Rather, disruptions in Dbp5  nucleocytoplasmic transport result in tRNA export defects, including changes in tRNA  shuttling dynamics during recovery from nutrient stress.",

        "Abstract": "Regulation of nuclear mRNA export is critical for proper eukaryotic gene expression.  A key step in this process is the directional translocation of  mRNA-ribonucleoprotein particles (mRNPs) through nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) that  are embedded in the nuclear envelope. Our previous studies in Saccharomyces  cerevisiae defined an in vivo role for inositol hexakisphosphate (InsP6) and  NPC-associated Gle1 in mRNA export. Here, we show that Gle1 and InsP6 act together  to stimulate the RNA-dependent ATPase activity of the essential DEAD-box protein  Dbp5. Overexpression of DBP5 specifically suppressed mRNA export and growth defects  of an ipk1 nup42 mutant defective in InsP6 production and Gle1 localization. In  vitro kinetic analysis showed that InsP6 significantly increased Dbp5 ATPase  activity in a Gle1-dependent manner and lowered the effective RNA concentration for  half-maximal ATPase activity. Gle1 alone had minimal effects. Maximal InsP6 binding  required both Dbp5 and Gle1. It has been suggested that Dbp5 requires unidentified  cofactors. We now propose that Dbp5 activation at NPCs requires Gle1 and InsP6. This  would facilitate spatial control of the remodelling of mRNP protein composition  during directional transport and provide energy to power transport cycles.",

        "Abstract": "In metazoans, replication-dependent histone mRNAs end in a stem-loop structure  instead of the poly(A) tail characteristic of all other mature mRNAs. This  specialized 3' end is bound by stem-loop binding protein (SLBP), a protein that  participates in the nuclear export and translation of histone mRNAs. The  translational activity of SLBP is mediated by interaction with SLIP1, a middle  domain of initiation factor 4G (MIF4G)-like protein that connects to translation  initiation. We determined the 2.5 \u00c5 resolution crystal structure of zebrafish SLIP1  bound to the translation-activation domain of SLBP and identified the determinants  of the recognition. We discovered a SLIP1-binding motif (SBM) in two additional  proteins: the translation initiation factor eIF3g and the mRNA-export factor DBP5.  We confirmed the binding of SLIP1 to DBP5 and eIF3g by pull-down assays and  determined the 3.25 \u00c5 resolution structure of SLIP1 bound to the DBP5 SBM. The  SBM-binding and homodimerization residues of SLIP1 are conserved in the MIF4G domain  of CBP80/20-dependent translation initiation factor (CTIF). The results suggest how  the SLIP1 homodimer or a SLIP1-CTIF heterodimer can function as platforms to bridge  SLBP with SBM-containing proteins involved in different steps of mRNA metabolism.",

Mature messenger ribonucleoproteins (mRNPs)  diffuse from sites of transcription to NPCs, although some active genes are  positioned at the nuclear periphery where they interact physically with components  of NPCs. As properly processed mRNPs translocate through the pore, certain mRNP  proteins are removed, probably through the enzymatic action of the DEAD-box helicase  Dbp5, which binds to Nup159 and Gle1, components of the cytoplasmic filaments of the  NPC. Gle1 and the phosphoinositide IP6 activate Dbp5's ATPase activity in vitro and  this could provide critical spatial regulation of Dbp5 activity in vivo.",

        "Abstract": "The mRNA lifecycle is driven through spatiotemporal changes in the protein  composition of mRNA particles (mRNPs) that are triggered by RNA-dependent DEAD-box  protein (Dbp) ATPases. As mRNPs exit the nuclear pore complex (NPC) in Saccharomyces  cerevisiae, this remodeling occurs through activation of Dbp5 by inositol  hexakisphosphate (IP(6) )-bound Gle1. At the NPC, Gle1 also binds Nup42, but Nup42's  molecular function is unclear. Here we employ the power of structure-function  analysis in S. cerevisiae and human (h) cells, and find that the high-affinity  Nup42-Gle1 interaction is integral to Dbp5 (hDDX19B) activation and efficient mRNA  export. The Nup42 carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) binds Gle1/hGle1B at an interface  distinct from the Gle1-Dbp5/hDDX19B interaction site. A nup42-CTD/gle1-CTD/Dbp5  trimeric complex forms in the presence of IP(6) . Deletion of NUP42 abrogates  Gle1-Dbp5 interaction, and disruption of the Nup42 or IP(6) binding interfaces on  Gle1/hGle1B leads to defective mRNA export in S. cerevisiae and human cells. In  vitro, Nup42-CTD and IP(6) stimulate Gle1/hGle1B activation of Dbp5 and DDX19B  recombinant proteins in similar, nonadditive manners, demonstrating complete  functional conservation between humans and S. cerevisiae. Together, a highly  conserved mechanism governs spatial coordination of mRNP remodeling during export.  This has implications for understanding human disease mutations that perturb the  Nup42-hGle1B interaction.",

Additionally, Dbp5/DDX19 and Rli1/ABCE1 are required; however, their  function in this process is currently unknown. Using a combination of in vivo and in  vitro experiments, we show that they regulate a stepwise assembly of the termination  complex. Rli1 and eRF3-GDP associate with the ribosome first. Subsequently, Dbp5-ATP  delivers eRF1 to the stop codon and in this way prevents a premature access of eRF3.  Dbp5 dissociates upon placing eRF1 through ATP-hydrolysis. This in turn enables eRF1  to contact eRF3, as the binding of Dbp5 and eRF3 to eRF1 is mutually exclusive.  Defects in the Dbp5-guided eRF1 delivery lead to premature contact and premature  dissociation of eRF1 and eRF3 from the ribosome and to subsequent stop codon  readthrough. Thus, the stepwise Dbp5-controlled termination complex assembly is  essential for regular translation termination events. Our data furthermore suggest a  possible role of Dbp5/DDX19 in alternative translation termination events, such as  during stress response or in developmental processes, which classifies the helicase  as a potential drug target for nonsense suppression therapy to treat cancer and  neurodegenerative diseases.",

        "Abstract": "mRNA export from the nucleus depends on the ATPase activity of the DEAD-box protein  Dbp5/DDX19. Although Dbp5 has measurable ATPase activity alone, several regulatory  factors (e.g., RNA, nucleoporin proteins, and the endogenous small molecule InsP6)  modulate catalytic activity in vitro and in vivo to facilitate mRNA export. An  analysis of the intrinsic and regulator-activated Dbp5 ATPase cycle is necessary to  define how these factors control Dbp5 and mRNA export. Here, we report a kinetic and  equilibrium analysis of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Dbp5 ATPase cycle, including  the influence of RNA on Dbp5 activity. These data show that ATP binds Dbp5 weakly in  rapid equilibrium with a binding affinity (KT~4 mM) comparable to the KM for  steady-state cycling, while ADP binds an order of magnitude more tightly (KD~0.4  mM). The overall intrinsic steady-state cycling rate constant (kcat) is limited by  slow, near-irreversible ATP hydrolysis and even slower subsequent phosphate release.  RNA increases kcat and rate-limiting Pi release 20-fold, although Pi release  continues to limit steady-state cycling in the presence of RNA, in conjunction with  RNA binding. Together, this work identifies RNA binding and Pi release as important  biochemical transitions within the Dbp5 ATPase cycle and provides a framework for  investigating the means by which Dbp5 and mRNA export is modulated by regulatory  factors.",

Although SON was discovered 25 years ago, the importance of SON's function was only  realized recently when its roles in nuclear organization and pre-mRNA splicing as  well as the influence of these activities in maintaining cellular health were  unveiled. Furthermore, SON was implicated to have a key role in stem cells as well  as during the onset of various diseases such as cancer, influenza, and hepatitis.  Here we review the progress that has been made in studying this multifunctional  protein and discuss questions that remain to be answered about SON.",

Here, we used infection with Francisella\u00a0tularensis to identify SON DNA-binding  protein as a central determinant of macrophage activities. RNAi knockdown of SON  increases survival of human macrophages following F.\u00a0tularensis infection or  inflammasome stimulation. SON is required for macrophage autophagy, interferon  response factor 3 expression, type I interferon response and inflammasome-associated  readouts. SON knockdown has gene- and stimulus-specific effects on inflammatory gene  expression. SON is required for accurate splicing and expression of GBF1, a key  mediator of cis-Golgi structure and function. Chemical GBF1 inhibition has similar  effects to SON knockdown, suggesting that SON controls macrophage functions at least  in part by controlling Golgi-associated processes.",

        "Abstract": "While dysregulation of RNA splicing has been recognized as an emerging target for  cancer therapy, the functional significance of RNA splicing and individual splicing  factors in brain tumors is poorly understood. Here, we identify SON as a master  regulator that activates PTBP1-mediated oncogenic splicing while suppressing  RBFOX2-mediated non-oncogenic neuronal splicing in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).  SON is overexpressed in GBM patients and SON knockdown causes failure in intron  removal from the PTBP1 transcript, resulting in PTBP1 downregulation and inhibition  of its downstream oncogenic splicing. Furthermore, SON forms a complex with hnRNP  A2B1 and antagonizes RBFOX2, which leads to skipping of RBFOX2-targeted cassette  exons, including the PTBP2 neuronal exon. SON knockdown inhibits proliferation and  clonogenicity of GBM cells in vitro and significantly suppresses tumor growth in  orthotopic xenografts in vivo. Collectively, our study reveals that SON-mediated RNA  splicing is a GBM vulnerability, implicating SON as a potential therapeutic target  in brain tumors.",

        "Abstract": "The gene SON is on human chromosome 21 (21q22.11) and is thought to be associated  with hematopoietic disorders that accompany Down syndrome. Additionally, SON is an  RNA splicing factor that plays a role in the transcription of leukemia-associated  genes. Previously, we showed that mutations in SON cause malformations in human and  zebrafish spines and brains during early embryonic development. To examine the role  of SON in normal hematopoiesis, we reduced expression of the zebrafish homolog of  SON in zebrafish at the single-cell developmental stage with specific morpholinos.  In addition to the brain and spinal malformations we also observed abnormal blood  cell levels upon son knockdown. We then investigated how blood production was  altered when levels of son were reduced. Decreased levels of son resulted in lower  amounts of red blood cells when visualized with lcr:GFP transgenic fish. There were  also reduced thrombocytes seen with cd41:GFP fish, and myeloid cells when mpx:GFP  fish were examined. We also observed a significant decrease in the quantity of T  cells, visualized with lck:GFP fish. However, when we examined their hematopoietic  stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), we saw no difference in colony-forming  capability. These studies indicate that son is essential for the proper  differentiation of the innate and adaptive immune system, and further investigation  determining the molecular pathways involved during blood development should  elucidate important information about vertebrate HSPC generation, proliferation, and  differentiation.",

        "Abstract": "DBP5, also known as DDX19, GLE1 and inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) function in  messenger RNA (mRNA) export at the cytoplasmic surface of the nuclear pore complex  in eukaryotic cells. DBP5 is a DEAD-box RNA helicase, and its activity is stimulated  by interactions with GLE1 and IP6. In addition, these three factors also have unique  role(s). To investigate how these factors influenced the cytoplasmic mRNA expression  and cell phenotype change, we performed RNA microarray analysis to detect the effect  and function of DBP5, GLE1 and IP6 on the cytoplasmic mRNA expression. The  expression of some cytoplasmic mRNA subsets (e.g. cell cycle, DNA replication) was  commonly suppressed by the knock-down of DBP5, GLE1 and IPPK (IP6 synthetic enzyme).  The GLE1 knock-down selectively reduced the cytoplasmic mRNA expression required for  mitotic progression, results in an abnormal spindle phenotype and caused the delay  of mitotic process. Meanwhile, G1/S cell cycle arrest was observed in DBP5 and IPPK  knock-down cells. Several factors that function in immune response were also  down-regulated in DBP5 or IPPK knock-down cells. Thereby, IFN\u03b2-1 mRNA transcription  evoked by poly(I:C) treatment was suppressed. These results imply that DBP5, GLE1  and IP6 have a conserved and individual function in the cytoplasmic mRNA expression.  Variations in phenotype are due to the difference in each function of DBP5, GLE1 and  IPPK in intracellular mRNA metabolism.",

        "Abstract": "The DEAD-box RNA-helicase Dbp5/Rat8 is known for its function in nuclear mRNA  export, where it displaces the export receptor Mex67 from the mRNA at the  cytoplasmic side of the nuclear pore complex (NPC). Here we show that Dbp5 is also  required for the nuclear export of both pre-ribosomal subunits. Yeast  temperature-sensitive dbp5 mutants accumulate both ribosomal particles in their  nuclei. Furthermore, Dbp5 genetically and physically interacts with known ribosomal  transport factors such as Nmd3. Similar to mRNA export we show that also for  ribosomal transport Dbp5 is required at the cytoplasmic side of the NPC. However,  unlike its role in mRNA export, Dbp5 does not seem to undergo its ATPase cycle for  this function, as ATPase-deficient dbp5 mutants that selectively inhibit mRNA export  do not affect ribosomal transport. Furthermore, mutants of GLE1, the ATPase  stimulating factor of Dbp5, show no major ribosomal export defects. Consequently,  while Dbp5 uses its ATPase cycle to displace the export receptor Mex67 from the  translocated mRNAs, Mex67 remains bound to ribosomal subunits upon transit to the  cytoplasm, where it is detectable on translating ribosomes. Therefore, we propose a  model, in which Dbp5 supports ribosomal transport by capturing ribosomal subunits  upon their cytoplasmic appearance at the NPC, possibly by binding export factors  such as Mex67. Thus, our findings reveal that although different  ribonucleoparticles, mRNAs and pre-ribosomal subunits, use shared export factors,  they utilize different transport mechanisms.",

        "Title": "Nanoscale mapping of nuclear phosphatidylinositol phosphate landscape by dual-color  dSTORM.",
        "Abstract": "Current models of gene expression, which are based on single-molecule localization  microscopy, acknowledge protein clustering and the formation of transcriptional  condensates as a driving force of gene expression. However, these models largely  omit the role of nuclear lipids and amongst them nuclear phosphatidylinositol  phosphates (PIPs) in particular. Moreover, the precise distribution of nuclear PIPs  in the functional sub-nuclear domains remains elusive. The direct stochastic optical  reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM) provides an unprecedented resolution in  biological imaging. Therefore, its use for imaging in the densely crowded cell  nucleus is desired but also challenging. Here we present a dual-color dSTORM imaging  and image analysis of nuclear PI(4,5)P2, PI(3,4)P2 and PI(4)P distribution while  preserving the context of nuclear architecture. In the nucleoplasm, PI(4,5)P2 and  PI(3,4)P2 co-pattern in close proximity with the subset of RNA polymerase II foci.  PI(4,5)P2 is surrounded by fibrillarin in the nucleoli and all three PIPs are  dispersed within the matrix formed by the nuclear speckle protein SON. PI(4,5)P2 is  the most abundant nuclear PIP, while PI(4)P is a precursor for the biosynthesis of  PI(4,5)P2 and PI(3,4)P2. Therefore, our data are relevant for the understanding the  roles of nuclear PIPs and provide further evidence for the model in which nuclear  PIPs represent a localization signal for the formation of lipo-ribonucleoprotein  hubs in the nucleus. The discussed experimental pipeline is applicable for further  functional studies on the role of other nuclear PIPs in the regulation of gene  expression and beyond.",

        "Title": "Nuclear export factor RBM15 facilitates the access of DBP5 to mRNA.",
        "Abstract": "The conserved mRNA export receptor NXF1 (Mex67 in yeast) assembles with messenger  ribonucleoproteins (mRNP) in the nucleus and guides them through the nuclear pore  complex into the cytoplasm. The DEAD family RNA helicase Dbp5 is essential for  nuclear export of mRNA and is thought to dissociate Mex67 from mRNP upon  translocation, thereby generating directional passage. However, the molecular  mechanism by which Dbp5 recognizes Mex67-containing mRNP is not clear. Here we  report that the human NXF1-binding protein RBM15 binds specifically to human DBP5  and facilitates its direct contact with mRNA in vivo. We found that RBM15 is  targeted to the nuclear envelope, where it colocalizes extensively with DBP5 and  NXF1. Gene silencing of RBM15 leads to cytoplasmic depletion and nuclear  accumulation of general mRNA as well as individual endogenous transcripts,  indicating that RBM15 is required for efficient mRNA export. We propose a model in  which RBM15 acts locally at the nuclear pore complex, by facilitating the  recognition of NXF1-mRNP complexes by DBP5 during translocation, thereby  contributing to efficient mRNA export.",

It  binds RNA and is concentrated and locally activated at the cytoplasmic side of the  nuclear pore complex. We have determined the crystal structures of human DBP5 bound  to RNA and AMPPNP, and bound to the cytoplasmic nucleoporin NUP214. The structures  reveal that binding of DBP5 to nucleic acid and to NUP214 is mutually exclusive.  Using in vitro assays, we demonstrate that NUP214 decreases both the RNA binding and  ATPase activities of DBP5. The interactions are mediated by conserved residues,  implying a conserved recognition mechanism. These results suggest a framework for  the consecutive steps leading to the release of mRNA at the final stages of nuclear  export. More generally, they provide a paradigm for how binding of regulators can  specifically inhibit DEAD-box proteins.",

We reveal links between splicing machinery  components and the intrinsically disordered ciliopathy protein SANS. Pathogenic  mutations in SANS/USH1G lead to Usher syndrome-the most common cause of  deaf-blindness. Previously, SANS was shown to function only in the cytosol and  primary cilia. Here, we have uncovered molecular links between SANS and pre-mRNA  splicing catalyzed by the spliceosome in the nucleus. We show that SANS is found in  Cajal bodies and nuclear speckles, where it interacts with components of  spliceosomal sub-complexes such as SF3B1 and the large splicing cofactor SON but  also with PRPFs and snRNAs related to the tri-snRNP complex. SANS is required for  the transfer of tri-snRNPs between Cajal bodies and nuclear speckles for spliceosome  assembly and may also participate in snRNP recycling back to Cajal bodies. SANS  depletion alters the kinetics of spliceosome assembly, leading to accumulation of  complex A. SANS deficiency and USH1G pathogenic mutations affects splicing of genes  related to cell proliferation and human Usher syndrome. Thus, we provide the first  evidence that splicing dysregulation may participate in the pathophysiology of Usher  syndrome.",

After transport-competent mature mRNP export complexes  are formed in the nucleus, their passage through nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) is  facilitated by the Mex67:Mtr2 heterodimer. At the NPC cytoplasmic face, mRNP  remodeling prevents its return to the nucleus and so functions as a molecular  ratchet imposing directionality on transport. In budding yeast, recent work suggests  that the DEAD-box helicase Dbp5 remodels mRNPs at the NPC cytoplasmic face by  removing Mex67 and that the Dbp5 ATPase is activated by Gle1 and inositol  hexaphosphate (IP(6)).",

        "Title": "The Dbp5 cycle at the nuclear pore complex during mRNA export II: nucleotide cycling  and mRNP remodeling by Dbp5 are controlled by Nup159 and Gle1.",
        "Abstract": "Essential messenger RNA (mRNA) export factors execute critical steps to mediate  directional transport through nuclear pore complexes (NPCs). At cytoplasmic NPC  filaments, the ATPase activity of DEAD-box protein Dbp5 is activated by inositol  hexakisphosphate (IP(6))-bound Gle1 to mediate remodeling of mRNA-protein (mRNP)  complexes. Whether a single Dbp5 executes multiple remodeling events and how Dbp5 is  recycled are unknown. Evidence suggests that Dbp5 binding to Nup159 is required for  controlling interactions with Gle1 and the mRNP. Using in vitro reconstitution  assays, we found here that Nup159 is specifically required for ADP release from  Dbp5. Moreover, Gle1-IP(6) stimulates ATP binding, thus priming Dbp5 for RNA  loading. In vivo, a dbp5-R256D/R259D mutant with reduced ADP binding bypasses the  need for Nup159 interaction. However, NPC spatial control is important, as a  dbp5-R256D/R259D nup42\u0394 double mutant is temperature-sensitive for mRNA export.  Further analysis reveals that remodeling requires a conformational shift to the  Dbp5-ADP form. ADP release factors for DEAD-box proteins have not been reported  previously and reflect a new paradigm for regulation. We propose a model wherein  Nup159 and Gle1-IP(6) regulate Dbp5 cycles by controlling its nucleotide-bound  state, allowing multiple cycles of mRNP remodeling by a single Dbp5 at the NPC.",

        "Title": "Snx4-assisted vacuolar targeting of transcription factors defines a new autophagy  pathway for controlling ATG expression.",
        "Abstract": "Autophagy, in part, is controlled by the repression and activation of  autophagy-related (ATG) genes. Here, we describe a new selective autophagy pathway  that targets functional transcriptional regulators to control their activity. This  pathway is activated in response to nitrogen starvation and recycles transcriptional  activators (Msn2 and Rim15) and a repressor (Ssn2/Med13) of ATG expression. Further  analysis of Ssn2/Med13 vacuolar proteolysis revealed that this pathway utilizes the  core autophagic machinery. However, it is independent of known nucleophagy  mechanisms, receptor proteins, and the scaffold protein Atg11. Instead, Ssn2/Med13  exits the nucleus through the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and associates with the  cytoplasmic nucleoporin Gle1, a member of the RNA remodeling complex. Dbp5 and  Nup159, that act in concert with Gle1, are also required for Ssn2/Med13 clearance.  Ssn2/Med13 is retrieved from the nuclear periphery and degraded by Atg17-initiated  phagophores anchored to the vacuole. Efficient transfer to phagophores depends on  the sorting nexin heterodimer Snx4/Atg24-Atg20, which binds to Atg17, and relocates  to the perinucleus following nitrogen starvation. To conclude, this pathway defines  a previously undescribed autophagy mechanism that targets select transcriptional  regulators for rapid vacuolar proteolysis, utilizing the RNA remodeling complex, the  sorting nexin heterodimer Snx4-Atg20, Atg17, and the core autophagic machinery. It  is physiologically relevant as this Snx4-assisted vacuolar targeting pathway permits  cells to fine-tune the autophagic response by controlling the turnover of both  positive and negative regulators of ATG transcription.Abbreviations: AIM: Atg8  interacting motif; ATG: autophagy-related; CKM: CDK8 kinase module; IDR:  intrinsically disordered region; IP(6): phosphoinositide inositol hexaphosphate;  NPC: nuclear pore complex; PAS: phagophore assembly site; UPS: ubiquitin-proteasomal  system.",

        "Title": "The Dbp5 cycle at the nuclear pore complex during mRNA export I: dbp5 mutants with  defects in RNA binding and ATP hydrolysis define key steps for Nup159 and Gle1.",
        "Abstract": "Nuclear export of messenger RNA (mRNA) occurs by translocation of mRNA/protein  complexes (mRNPs) through nuclear pore complexes (NPCs). The DEAD-box protein Dbp5  mediates export by triggering removal of mRNP proteins in a spatially controlled  manner. This requires Dbp5 interaction with Nup159 in NPC cytoplasmic filaments and  activation of Dbp5's ATPase activity by Gle1 bound to inositol hexakisphosphate  (IP(6)). However, the precise sequence of events within this mechanism has not been  fully defined. Here we analyze dbp5 mutants that alter ATP binding, ATP hydrolysis,  or RNA binding. We found that ATP binding and hydrolysis are required for efficient  Dbp5 association with NPCs. Interestingly, mutants defective for RNA binding are  dominant-negative (DN) for mRNA export in yeast and human cells. We show that the DN  phenotype stems from competition with wild-type Dbp5 for Gle1 at NPCs. The Dbp5-Gle1  interaction is limiting for export and, importantly, can be independent of Nup159.  Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching experiments in yeast show a very dynamic  association between Dbp5 and NPCs, averaging <1 sec, similar to reported NPC  translocation rates for mRNPs. This work reveals critical steps in the  Gle1-IP(6)/Dbp5/Nup159 cycle, and suggests that the number of remodeling events  mediated by a single Dbp5 is limited.",

        "Title": "Nuclear speckle fusion via long-range directional motion regulates speckle  morphology after transcriptional inhibition.",
        "Abstract": "Although the formation of RNA-protein bodies has been studied intensively, their  mobility and how their number and size are regulated are still poorly understood.  Here, we show significantly increased mobility of nuclear speckles after  transcriptional inhibition, including long-range directed motion of one speckle  towards another speckle, terminated by speckle fusion, over distances up to 4\u2005\u00b5m and  with velocities between 0.2\u2005\u00b5m/min and 1.5\u2005\u00b5m/min. Frequently, three or even four  speckles follow very similar paths, with new speckles appearing along the path  followed by a preceding speckle. Speckle movements and fusion events contribute to  fewer, but larger, speckles after transcriptional inhibition. These speckle  movements are not actin dependent, but occur within chromatin-depleted channels  enriched with small granules containing the speckle marker protein SON. Similar  long-range speckle movements and fusion events were observed after heat shock or  heavy metal stress, and during late G2 and early prophase. Our observations suggest  a mechanism for long-range, directional nuclear speckle movements, contributing to  overall regulation of nuclear speckle number and size as well as overall nuclear  organization. This article has an associated First Person interview with the first  author of the paper.",

        "Title": "A conserved mechanism of DEAD-box ATPase activation by nucleoporins and InsP6 in  mRNA export.",
        "Abstract": "Superfamily 1 and superfamily 2 RNA helicases are ubiquitous messenger-RNA-protein  complex (mRNP) remodelling enzymes that have critical roles in all aspects of RNA  metabolism. The superfamily 2 DEAD-box ATPase Dbp5 (human DDX19) functions in mRNA  export and is thought to remodel mRNPs at the nuclear pore complex (NPC). Dbp5 is  localized to the NPC via an interaction with Nup159 (NUP214 in vertebrates) and is  locally activated there by Gle1 together with the small-molecule inositol  hexakisphosphate (InsP(6)). Local activation of Dbp5 at the NPC by Gle1 is essential  for mRNA export in vivo; however, the mechanistic role of Dbp5 in mRNP export is  poorly understood and it is not known how Gle1(InsP6) and Nup159 regulate the  activity of Dbp5. Here we report, from yeast, structures of Dbp5 in complex with  Gle1(InsP6), Nup159/Gle1(InsP6) and RNA. These structures reveal that InsP(6)  functions as a small-molecule tether for the Gle1-Dbp5 interaction. Surprisingly,  the Gle1(InsP6)-Dbp5 complex is structurally similar to another DEAD-box ATPase  complex essential for translation initiation, eIF4G-eIF4A, and we demonstrate that  Gle1(InsP6) and eIF4G both activate their DEAD-box partner by stimulating RNA  release. Furthermore, Gle1(InsP6) relieves Dbp5 autoregulation and cooperates with  Nup159 in stabilizing an open Dbp5 intermediate that precludes RNA binding. These  findings explain how Gle1(InsP6), Nup159 and Dbp5 collaborate in mRNA export and  provide a general mechanism for DEAD-box ATPase regulation by Gle1/eIF4G-like  activators.",

Here, we identify the  nuclear pore protein Gle1 as a cellular activator of Dbp5. Dbp5 alone is unable to  stably bind RNA or effectively hydrolyse ATP under physiological conditions, but  addition of Gle1 dramatically stimulates these activities. A gle1 point mutant  deficient for Dbp5 stimulation in vitro displays an mRNA export defect in vivo,  indicating that activation of Dbp5 is an essential function of Gle1. Interestingly,  Gle1 binds directly to inositol hexakisphosphate (InsP6) and InsP6 potentiates the  Gle1-mediated stimulation of Dbp5. Dominant mutations in DBP5 and GLE1 that rescue  mRNA export phenotypes associated with the lack of InsP6 mimic the InsP6 effects in  vitro. Our results define specific functions for Gle1 and InsP6 in mRNA export and  suggest that local activation of Dbp5 at the nuclear pore is critical for mRNA  export.",

        "Title": "Regulation of ghrelin signaling by a leptin-induced gene, negative regulatory  element-binding protein, in the hypothalamic neurons.",
        "Abstract": "Leptin, the product of the ob gene, plays important roles in the regulation of food  intake and body weight through its receptor in the hypothalamus. To identify novel  transcripts induced by leptin, we performed cDNA subtraction based on selective  suppression of the polymerase chain reaction by using mRNA prepared from the  forebrain of leptin-injected ob/ob mice. One of the genes isolated was a mouse  homolog of human negative regulatory element-binding protein (NREBP). Its expression  was markedly increased by leptin in the growth hormone secretagogue-receptor  (GHS-R)-positive neurons of the arcuate nucleus and ventromedial hypothalamic  nucleus. The promoter region of GHS-R contains one NREBP binding sequence,  suggesting that NREBP regulates GHS-R transcription. Luciferase reporter assays  showed that NREBP repressed GHS-R promoter activity in a hypothalamic neuronal cell  line, GT1-7, and its repressive activity was abolished by the replacement of  negative regulatory element in GHS-R promoter. Overexpression of NREBP reduced the  protein expression of endogenous GHS-R without affecting the expression of ob-Rb in  GT1-7 cells. To determine the functional importance of NREBP in the hypothalamus, we  assessed the effects of NREBP on ghrelin action. Although phosphorylation of  AMP-activated protein kinase \u03b1 (AMPK\u03b1) was induced by ghrelin in GT1-7 cells, NREBP  repressed ghrelin-induced AMPK\u03b1 phosphorylation. These results suggest that  leptin-induced NREBP is an important regulator of GHS-R expression in the  hypothalamus and provides a novel molecular link between leptin and ghrelin  signaling.",

        "Abstract": "The DExD/H-box RNA-dependent ATPase Dbp5 plays an essential role in the nuclear  export of mRNA. Dbp5 localizes to the nuclear pore complex, where its ATPase  activity is stimulated by Gle1 and its coactivator inositol hexakisphosphate. Here,  we present the crystal structure of the C-terminal domain of Dbp5, refined to 1.8 A.  The structure reveals a RecA-like fold that contains two defining characteristics  not present in other structurally characterized DExD/H-box proteins: a C-terminal  alpha-helix and a loop connecting beta5 and alpha4, both of which are composed of  conserved and unique elements in the Dbp5 primary sequence. Using structure-guided  mutagenesis, we have identified several charged surface residues that, when mutated,  weaken the binding of Gle1 and inhibit the ability of Gle1 to stimulate Dbp5's  ATPase activity. In vivo analysis of the same mutations reveals that those mutants  displaying the weakest ATPase stimulation in vitro are also unable to support yeast  growth. Analysis of the correlation between the in vitro and in vivo data indicates  that a threshold level of Dbp5 ATPase activity is required for cellular mRNA export  that is not met by the unstimulated enzyme, suggesting a possible mechanism by which  Dbp5's activity can be modulated to regulate mRNA export.",

        "Title": "Degradation of oligouridylated histone mRNAs: see UUUUU and goodbye.",
        "Abstract": "During the cell cycle the expression of replication-dependent histones is tightly  coupled to DNA synthesis. Histone messenger RNA (mRNA) levels strongly increase  during early S-phase and rapidly decrease at the end of it. Here, we review the  degradation of replication-dependent histone mRNAs, a paradigm of  post-transcriptional gene regulation, in the context of processing, translation, and  oligouridylation. Replication-dependent histone transcripts are characterized by the  absence of introns and by the presence of a stem-loop structure at the 3' end of a  very short 3' untranslated region (UTR). These features, together with a need for  active translation, are a prerequisite for their rapid decay. The degradation is  induced by 3' end additions of untemplated uridines, performed by terminal uridyl  transferases. Such 3' oligouridylated transcripts are preferentially bound by the  heteroheptameric LSM1-7 complex, which also interacts with the 3'\u21925' exonuclease  ERI1 (also called 3'hExo). Presumably in cooperation with LSM1-7 and aided by the  helicase UPF1, ERI1 degrades through the stem-loop of oligouridylated histone mRNAs  in repeated rounds of partial degradation and reoligouridylation. Although histone  mRNA decay is now known in some detail, important questions remain open: How is  ceasing nuclear DNA replication relayed to the cytoplasmic histone mRNA degradation?  Why is translation important for this process? Recent research on factors such as  SLIP1, DBP5, eIF3, CTIF, CBP80/20, and ERI1 has provided new insights into the 3'  end formation, the nuclear export, and the translation of histone mRNAs. We discuss  how these results fit with the preparation of histone mRNAs for degradation, which  starts as early as these transcripts are generated.",

        "Abstract": "Although genetic testing is increasingly used in clinical nephrology, a large number  of patients with congenital abnormalities of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT)  remain undiagnosed with current gene panels. Therefore, careful curation of novel  genetic findings is key to improving diagnostic yields. We recently described a  novel intellectual disability syndrome caused by de novo heterozygous  loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding the splicing factor SON. Here, we  show that many of these patients, including two previously unreported, exhibit a  wide array of kidney abnormalities. Detailed phenotyping of 14 patients with SON  haploinsufficiency identified kidney anomalies in 8 patients, including horseshoe  kidney, unilateral renal hypoplasia, and renal cysts. Recurrent urinary tract  infections, electrolyte disturbances, and hypertension were also observed in some  patients. SON knockdown in kidney cell lines leads to abnormal pre-mRNA splicing,  resulting in decreased expression of several established CAKUT genes. Furthermore,  these molecular events were observed in patient-derived cells with SON  haploinsufficiency. Taken together, our data suggest that the wide spectrum of  phenotypes in patients with a pathogenic SON mutation is a consequence of impaired  pre-mRNA splicing of several CAKUT genes. We propose that genetic testing panels  designed to diagnose children with a kidney phenotype should include the SON gene.",

        "Abstract": "Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) depend on glycolysis for energy and substrates  for biosynthesis. To understand the mechanisms governing the metabolism of hESCs, we  investigated the transcriptional regulation of glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1,  SLC2A1), a key glycolytic gene to maintain pluripotency. By combining the  genome-wide data of binding sites of the core pluripotency factors (SOX2, OCT4,  NANOG, denoted SON), chromosomal interaction and histone modification in hESCs, we  identified a potential enhancer of the GLUT1 gene in hESCs, denoted GLUT1 enhancer  (GE) element. GE interacts with the promoter of GLUT1, and the deletion of GE  significantly reduces the expression of GLUT1, glucose uptake and glycolysis of  hESCs, confirming that GE is an enhancer of GLUT1 in hESCs. In addition, the  mutation of SON binding motifs within GE reduced the expression of GLUT1 as well as  the interaction between GE and GLUT1 promoter, indicating that the binding of SON to  GE is important for its activity. Therefore, SON promotes glucose uptake and  glycolysis in hESCs by inducing GLUT1 expression through directly activating the  enhancer of GLUT1.",

METHODS: The clinical and genetic data of a  Chinese girl with severe growth and development delay, intellectual disability, and  facial features were analyzed. Original articles on ZTTK syndrome published up to  November 20l8 were identified from PubMed, Human Gene Mutation Database, Online  Mendelian Inheritance in Man, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and WanFang  databases using the keywords \"ZTTK syndrome\" and \"SON\". RESULTS: The patient was  born small for gestational age, and had poor academic performance, delayed language  development, and motor retardation. The patient's height was 113\u00a0cm (less than -3  SD), and had moles on the back skin and possessed facial features. A novel  heterozygous mutation c.394C>T (p.Q132X) of SON was found in this patient, but the  parents were normal. CONCLUSION: The patient's clinical phenotype was consistent  with ZTTK syndrome. The novel heterozygous mutation c.394C>T (p.Q132X) of SON was  its pathogenic mutation, which has not been reported at home and abroad.",

        "Abstract": "The pre-adult patterns of change in blood pressure with age have been investigated  by review and pooled analysis of the relevant worldwide literature. The results  indicate, foremost, the almost universal overall upward progression of blood  pressure levels between ages 6 and 18 years, separately for systolic, fourth-phase  and fifth-phase diastolic pressures (SBP, DBP4, DBP5). This report summarizes  results of an extensive literature search based on 129 qualifying publications, in  many languages, of which 79 yielded data adequate for a pooled age-sex-specific  analysis for boys and girls aged 6-18 years. More than 200,000 observations were  available for SBP and nearly 100,000 each for DBP4 and DBP5, respectively. In this  overall pool, SBP increased uniformly for boys from age 6-12 and for girls from 6-9,  at 1.4 mm Hg/yr; for boys the slope increased abruptly to 3.2 mm Hg/yr from 12-15  and fell to 0 at age 18; for girls the maximum increase was only 2.1 mm Hg/yr, from  9-13, and it reversed at age 16, reaching -3.4 mm Hg/yr from 17-18. Thus for SBP the  absolute values for boys and girls were identical up to age nine and nearly so to  age 14 and then separated, with values for girls increasing only slightly to age 16  and actually decreasing to age 18. A similar separation of age-specific values by  sex occurred with DBP4, but not until age 16, after which DBP4 decreased for  girls.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "Abstract": "Numerous molecular details of intracellular mRNA processing have been revealed in  recent years. However, the export process of single native mRNA molecules, the  actual translocation through the nuclear pore complex (NPC), could not yet be  examined in vivo. The problem is observing mRNA molecules without interfering with  their native behavior. We used a protein-based labeling approach to visualize single  native mRNPs in live salivary gland cells of Chironomus tentans, an iconic system  used for decades to study the mRNA life cycle. Recombinant hrp36, the C. tentans  homolog of mammalian hnRNP A1, was fluorescence labeled and microinjected into  living cells, where it was integrated into nascent mRNPs. Intranuclear trajectories  of single mRNPs, including their NPC passage, were observed with high space and time  resolution employing a custom-built light sheet fluorescence microscope. We analyzed  the kinetics and dynamics of mRNP export and started to study its mechanism and  regulation by measuring the turnover-kinetics of single Dbp5 at the NPC.",

        "Abstract": "Methylation of HBV cccDNA has been detected in vivo and in vitro; however, the  mechanism and its effects on HBV replication remain unclear. HBx derived from a  1.2-mer HBV replicon upregulated protein levels and enzyme activities of DNA  methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), 3a, and 3b, resulting in methylation of the negative  regulatory region (NRE) in cccDNA, while none of these effects were observed with an  HBx-null mutant. The HBx-positive HBV cccDNA expressed higher levels of HBc and  produced about 4-fold higher levels of HBV particles than those from the HBx-null  counterpart. For these effects, HBx interrupted the action of NRE binding protein  via methylation of the C-1619 within NRE, resulting in activation of the core  promoter. Treatment with 5-Aza-2'dC or DNMT1 knock-down drastically impaired the  ability of HBx to activate the core promoter and stimulate HBV replication in  1.2-mer HBV replicon and in vitro infection systems, indicating the positive role of  HBx-mediated cccDNA methylation in HBV replication.",

The wide application and increasing  accessibility of whole exome sequencing (WES) has helped to identify new cases of  ZTTK syndrome over the last few years. To date, there have been approximately 45  cases reported in the literature. Here, we describe 15 additional individuals with  variants in the SON gene, including those with missense variants bringing the total  number of known cases to 60. We have reviewed the clinical and molecular data of  these new cases and all previously reported cases to further delineate the most  common as well as emerging clinical findings related to this syndrome. Furthermore,  we aim to delineate any genotype-phenotype correlations specifically for a recurring  pathogenic four base pair deletion (c.5753_5756del) along with discussing the impact  of missense variants seen in the SON gene.",

        "Abstract": "A critical step during gene expression is the directional export of nuclear  messenger (m)RNA through nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) to the cytoplasm. During  export, Gle1 in conjunction with inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) spatially regulates  the activity of the DEAD-box protein Dbp5 at the NPC cytoplasmic face. GLE1  mutations are causally linked to the human diseases lethal congenital contracture  syndrome 1 (LCCS-1) and lethal arthrogryposis with anterior horn cell disease  (LAAHD). Here, structure prediction and functional analysis provide strong evidence  to suggest that the LCCS-1 and LAAHD disease mutations disrupt the function of Gle1  in mRNA export. Strikingly, direct fluorescence microscopy in living cells reveals a  dramatic loss of steady-state NPC localization for GFP-gle1 proteins expressed from  human gle1 genes harboring LAAHD and LCCS-1 mutations. The potential significance of  these residues is further clarified by analyses of sequence and predicted structural  conservation. This work offers insights into the perturbed mechanisms underlying  human LCCS-1 and LAAHD disease states and emphasizes the potential impact of altered  mRNA transport and gene expression in human disease.",

        "Title": "Tap and Dbp5, but not Gag, are involved in DR-mediated nuclear export of unspliced  Rous sarcoma virus RNA.",
        "Abstract": "All retroviruses must circumvent cellular restrictions on the export of unspliced  RNAs from the nucleus. While the unspliced RNA export pathways for HIV and  Mason-Pfizer monkey virus are well characterized, that of Rous sarcoma virus (RSV)  is not. We have previously reported that the RSV direct repeat (DR) elements are  involved in the cytoplasmic accumulation of unspliced viral RNA. Here, using  fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), we demonstrate that unspliced viral RNAs  bearing a single point mutation (G8863C) in the DR exhibit a restricted cellular  localization in and around the nucleus. In contrast, wild type unspliced viral RNA  had a diffuse localization throughout the nucleus and cytoplasm. Since the RSV Gag  protein has a transient localization in the nucleus, we examined the effect of Gag  over-expression on a DR-mediated reporter construct. While Gag did not enhance  DR-mediated nuclear export, the dominant-negative expression of two cellular export  factors, Tap and Dbp5, inhibited expression of the same reporter construct.  Furthermore, FISH studies using the dominant-negative Dbp5 demonstrated that  unspliced wild type RSV RNA was retained within the nucleus. Taken together, these  results further implicate the DR in nuclear RNA export through interactions with Tap  and Dbp5.",

        "Abstract": "DEAD-box protein (Dbp) family members are essential for gene expression; however,  their precise roles and regulation are not fully defined. During messenger (m)RNA  export, Gle1 bound to inositol hexakisphosphate (IP(6)) acts via Dbp5 to facilitate  remodeling of mRNA-protein complexes. In contrast, here we define a novel Gle1 role  in translation initiation through regulation of a different DEAD-box protein, the  initiation factor Ded1. We find that Gle1 physically and genetically interacts with  Ded1. Surprisingly, whereas Gle1 stimulates Dbp5, it inhibits Ded1 ATPase activity  in vitro, and IP(6) does not affect this inhibition. Functionally, a gle1-4 mutant  specifically suppresses initiation defects in a ded1-120 mutant, and ded1 and gle1  mutants have complementary perturbations in AUG start site recognition. Consistent  with this role in initiation, Gle1 inhibits translation in vitro in competent  extracts. These results indicate that Gle1 has a direct role in initiation and  negatively regulates Ded1. Together, the differential regulation of two distinct  DEAD-box proteins by a common factor (Gle1) establishes a new paradigm for  controlling gene expression and coupling translation with mRNA export.",

        "Title": "Structural basis for the assembly and disassembly of mRNA nuclear export complexes.",
        "Abstract": "Most of the individual components of the nuclear elements of the gene expression  pathway have been identified and high-resolution structural information is becoming  available for many of them. Information is also starting to become available on the  larger complexes they form and is beginning to give clues about how the dynamics of  their interactions generate function. Although the translocation of export-competent  messenger ribonucleoprotein particles (mRNPs) through the nuclear pore transport  channel that is mediated by interactions with nuclear pore proteins (nucleoporins)  is relatively well understood, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying the  assembly of export-competent mRNPs in the nucleus and their Dbp5-mediated  disassembly in the cytoplasm is less well defined. Considerable information has been  obtained on the structure of Dbp5 in its different nucleotide-bound states and in  complex with Gle1 or Nup159/NUP214. Although the precise manner by which the Dbp5  ATPase cycle is coupled to mRNP remodelling remains to be established, current  models capture many key details of this process. The formation of export-competent  mRNPs in the nucleus remains an elusive component of this pathway and the precise  nature of the remodelling that generates these mRNPs as well as detailed  understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which this step is integrated with the  transcriptional, splicing and polyadenylation machinery by the TREX and TREX-2  complexes remain obscure.

        "Title": "The mRNA export factor Dbp5 is associated with Balbiani ring mRNP from gene to  cytoplasm.",
        "Abstract": "The DEAD box RNA helicase Dbp5 is essential for nucleocytoplasmic transport of  mRNA-protein (mRNP) complexes. Dbp5 is present mainly in the cytoplasm and is  enriched at the cytoplasmic side of nuclear pore complexes (NPCs), suggesting that  it acts in the late part of mRNP export. Here, we visualize the assembly and  transport of a specific mRNP particle, the Balbiani ring mRNP in the dipteran  Chironomus tentans, and show that a Dbp5 homologue in C.tentans, Ct-Dbp5, binds to  pre-mRNP co-transcriptionally and accompanies the mRNP to and through the nuclear  pores and into the cytoplasm. We also demonstrate that Ct-Dbp5 accumulates in the  nucleus and partly disappears from the NPC when nuclear export of mRNA is inhibited.  The fact that Ct-Dbp5 is present along the exiting mRNP fibril extending from the  nuclear pore into the cytoplasm supports the view that Ct-Dbp5 is involved in  restructuring the mRNP prior to translation. Finally, the addition of the export  factor Dbp5 to the growing transcript highlights the importance of the  co-transcriptional loading process in determining the fate of mRNA.",

        "Abstract": "Dysregulation of MLL complex-mediated histone methylation plays a pivotal role in  gene expression associated with diseases, but little is known about cellular factors  modulating MLL complex activity. Here, we report that SON, previously known as an  RNA splicing factor, controls MLL complex-mediated transcriptional initiation. SON  binds to DNA near transcription start sites, interacts with menin, and inhibits MLL  complex assembly, resulting in decreased H3K4me3 and transcriptional repression.  Importantly, alternatively spliced short isoforms of SON are markedly upregulated in  acute myeloid leukemia. The short isoforms compete with full-length SON for  chromatin occupancy but lack the menin-binding ability, thereby antagonizing  full-length SON function in transcriptional repression while not impairing  full-length SON-mediated RNA splicing. Furthermore, overexpression of a short  isoform of SON enhances replating potential of hematopoietic progenitors. Our  findings define SON as a fine-tuner of the MLL-menin interaction and reveal short  SON overexpression as a marker indicating aberrant transcriptional initiation in  leukemia.",

        "Title": "Mechanistic insights into mRNA export through structures of Dbp5.",
        "Abstract": "Nuclear export of mRNA is a critical event in mRNA biogenesis. Passage of mature  messenger ribonucleoproteins (mRNPs) through nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) is  facilitated by the Mex67/Mtr2 heterodimer. At the NPC cytoplasmic face, the DEAD-box  RNA helicase Dbp5 remodels mRNPs by removing Mex67/Mtr2. This remodeling process  prevents mRNPs from returning to the nucleus, thereby imposing unidirectionality on  mRNA export. Biochemical studies show that Gle1 and inositol hexaphosphate (IP6)  activate Dbp5's ATPase activity at the cytoplasmic face of NPC, therefore providing  critical spatial regulation of mRNP remodeling during directional transport. Recent  structural studies on Dbp5 in free form and in complex with its ligands (ADP,  AMPPNP/RNA) as well as with cytoplasmic nucleoporin Nup214 reveal that the binding  of ADP or AMPPNP/RNA induces large conformational changes of Dbp5, and RNA and  NUP214 bind to Dbp5 in a mutually exclusive manner. These structural data combined  with complementary functional analysis significantly advance our understanding on  the mechanism governing mRNA export albeit some key issues remain elusive.",

        "Abstract": "A supernumerary copy of human chromosome 21 (HC21) causes Down syndrome. To  understand the molecular pathogenesis of Down syndrome, it is necessary to identify  all HC21 genes. The first annotation of the sequence of 21q confirmed 127 genes, and  predicted an additional 98 previously unknown \"anonymous\" genes (predictions (PREDs)  and open reading frames (C21orfs)), which were foreseen by exon prediction programs  and/or spliced expressed sequence tags. These putative gene models still need to be  confirmed as bona fide transcripts. Here we report the characterization and  expression pattern of the putative transcripts C21orf7, C21orf11, C21orf15,  C21orf18, C21orf19, C21orf22, C21orf42, C21orf50, C21orf51, C21orf57, and C21orf58,  the GC-rich sequence DNA-binding factor candidate GCFC (also known as C21orf66),  PRED12, PRED31, PRED34, PRED44, PRED54, and PRED56. Our analysis showed that most of  the C21orfs originally defined by matching spliced expressed sequence tags were  correctly predicted, whereas many of the PREDs, defined solely by computer  prediction, do not correspond to genuine genes. Four of the six PREDs were  incorrectly predicted: PRED44 and C21orf11 are portions of the same transcript,  PRED31 is a pseudogene, and PRED54 and PRED56 were wrongly predicted. In contrast,  PRED12 (now called C21orf68) and PRED34 (C21orf63) are now confirmed transcripts. We  identified three new genes, C21orf67, C21orf69, and C21orf70, not previously  predicted by any programs. This revision of the HC21 transcriptome has consequences  for the entire genome regarding the quality of previous annotations and the total  number of transcripts. It also provides new candidates for genes involved in Down  syndrome and other genetic disorders that map to HC21.",

        "Abstract": "In eukaryotes, termination of messenger RNA (mRNA) translation is mediated by the  release factors eRF1 and eRF3. Using Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model organism,  we have identified a member of the DEAD-box protein (DBP) family, the DEAD-box RNA  helicase and mRNA export factor Dbp5, as a player in translation termination. Dbp5  interacts genetically with both release factors and the polyadenlyate-binding  protein Pab1. A physical interaction was specifically detected with eRF1. Moreover,  we show that the helicase activity of Dbp5 is required for efficient stop-codon  recognition, and intact Dbp5 is essential for recruitment of eRF3 into termination  complexes. Therefore, Dbp5 controls the eRF3-eRF1 interaction and thus eRF3-mediated  downstream events.",

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Systolic and fourth-phase and fifth-phase diastolic blood pressure (SBP,  DBP4, DBP5) have appeared to differ in their patterns of age-related change, and SBP  and DBP5 differ in their respective associations with anthropometric variables.  Project HeartBeat! investigated trajectories of change in SBP, DBP4, and SBP5 with  age and their relationships with indices of adiposity, controlling for energy  intake, physical activity, and sexual maturation. METHODS: Project HeartBeat! was a  mixed longitudinal study in 678 black and white girls and boys aged 8, 11, or 14  years at first examination, followed at 4-month intervals for up to 4 years  (1991-1995). A statistical model was estimated for the trajectory of change in each  blood pressure measure from ages 8 to 18 years. RESULTS: For SBP, DBP4, and DBP5,  the trajectories were sigmoid, parabolic, and linear in form, respectively. SBP and  DBP4 differed significantly by gender; DBP4 and DBP5 were significantly related to  race. Adjusted for age, gender, and race, all relationships of adiposity-related  variables (percent body fat, abdominal circumference, skinfold thickness, and BMI  and its fat and fat-free components) with SBP were positive and significant.  Corresponding relationships for DBP4 were notably weaker but significant, and for  DBP5, weak or not significant. After adjusting for diet, physical inactivity, and  maturation, no DBP5 relationship with adiposity indices remained significant.  CONCLUSIONS: SBP, DBP4, and DBP5 are distinct in patterns of change with age,  relationships to gender and race, and patterns of association with multiple  anthropometric indices related to adiposity.",

        "Title": "An in vivo control map for the eukaryotic mRNA translation machinery.",
        "Abstract": "Rate control analysis defines the in vivo control map governing yeast protein  synthesis and generates an extensively parameterized digital model of the  translation pathway. Among other non-intuitive outcomes, translation demonstrates a  high degree of functional modularity and comprises a non-stoichiometric combination  of proteins manifesting functional convergence on a shared maximal translation rate.  In exponentially growing cells, polypeptide elongation (eEF1A, eEF2, and eEF3)  exerts the strongest control. The two other strong control points are recruitment of  mRNA and tRNA(i) to the 40S ribosomal subunit (eIF4F and eIF2) and termination  (eRF1; Dbp5). In contrast, factors that are found to promote mRNA scanning  efficiency on a longer than-average 5'untranslated region (eIF1, eIF1A, Ded1, eIF2B,  eIF3, and eIF5) exceed the levels required for maximal control. This is expected to  allow the cell to minimize scanning transition times, particularly for longer  5'UTRs. The analysis reveals these and other collective adaptations of control  shared across the factors, as well as features that reflect functional modularity  and system robustness. Remarkably, gene duplication is implicated in the fine  control of cellular protein synthesis.",

        "Abstract": "Subnuclear organization and spatiotemporal regulation of pre-mRNA processing factors  is essential for the production of mature protein-coding mRNAs. We have discovered  that a large protein called Son has a novel role in maintaining proper nuclear  organization of pre-mRNA processing factors in nuclear speckles. The primary  sequence of Son contains a concentrated region of multiple unique tandem repeat  motifs that may support a role for Son as a scaffolding protein for RNA processing  factors in nuclear speckles. We used RNA interference (RNAi) approaches and  high-resolution microscopy techniques to study the functions of Son in the context  of intact cells. Although Son precisely colocalizes with pre-mRNA splicing factors  in nuclear speckles, its depletion by RNAi leads to cell cycle arrest in metaphase  and causes dramatic disorganization of small nuclear ribonuclear protein and  serine-arginine rich protein splicing factors during interphase. Here, we propose  that Son is essential for appropriate subnuclear organization of pre-mRNA splicing  factors and for promoting normal cell cycle progression.",

        "Title": "Structural basis for the function of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Gfd1 protein in  mRNA nuclear export.",
        "Abstract": "Following transcription, mRNA is processed, packaged into messenger  ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) particles, and transported through nuclear pores (NPCs) to  the cytoplasm. At the NPC cytoplasmic face, Dbp5 mediates mRNP remodeling and mRNA  export factor dissociation, releasing transcripts for translation. In Saccharomyces  cerevisiae, the conserved poly(A) RNA-binding protein, Nab2, facilitates NPC  targeting of transcripts and also modulates poly(A) tail length. Dbp5 removes Nab2  from mRNPs at the cytoplasmic face of the pore and, importantly, a Nab2 RNA-binding  mutant suppresses the thermosensitive rat8-2 (dbp5) mutant. GFD1 is a multicopy  suppressor of rat8-2 (dbp5), and Gfd1 interacts physically with both Dbp5 and the  Nab2 N-terminal domain (Nab2-N). Here, we present a structural and functional  analysis of the Gfd1/Nab2-N interaction. Crystallography, supported by solution NMR,  shows that Gfd1 residues 126-150 form an alpha-helix when bound to Nab2-N.  Engineered Nab2-N and Gfd1 mutants that inhibit this interaction in vitro were used  to probe its function in vivo using the genetic interaction between GFD1 and NAB2.  Although GFD1 is not essential for viability, its deletion severely impairs growth  of rat8-2 (dbp5) cells. Moreover, although Gfd1 overexpression suppresses rat8-2  (dbp5), Gfd1 mutants that do not bind Nab2 only partially suppress rat8-2 (dbp5).  Furthermore, rat8-2 (dbp5) cells that express nab2-Y34A, in which binding to Gfd1 is  impaired, show a synthetic growth phenotype and nuclear accumulation of poly(A) RNA.  These data support the importance of the Gfd1/Nab2 interaction for Dbp5 activity and  provide further molecular details of the interactions that facilitate Dbp5-mediated  mRNP remodeling in the terminal step of mRNA export.",

        "Abstract": "Zhu-Tokita-Takenouchi-Kim (ZTTK) syndrome, a rare congenital anomaly syndrome  characterized by intellectual disability, brain malformation, facial dysmorphism,  musculoskeletal abnormalities, and some visceral malformations is caused by de novo  heterozygous mutations of the SON gene. The nuclear protein SON is involved in gene  transcription and RNA splicing; however, the roles of SON in neural development  remain undetermined. We investigated the effects of Son knockdown on neural  development in mice and found that Son knockdown in neural progenitors resulted in  defective migration during corticogenesis and reduced spine density on mature  cortical neurons. The induction of human wild-type SON expression rescued these  neural abnormalities, confirming that the abnormalities were caused by SON  insufficiency. We also applied truncated SON proteins encoded by disease-associated  mutant SON genes for rescue experiments and found that a truncated SON protein  encoded by the most prevalent SON mutant found in ZTTK syndrome rescued the neural  abnormalities while another much shorter mutant SON protein did not. These data  indicate that SON insufficiency causes neuronal migration defects and dendritic  spine abnormalities, which seem neuropathological bases of the neural symptoms of  ZTTK syndrome. In addition, the results support that the neural abnormalities in  ZTTK syndrome are caused by SON haploinsufficiency independent of the types of  mutation that results in functional or dysfunctional proteins.",

        "Abstract": "Dbp5 is a DEAD-box protein essential for mRNA export from the nucleus in yeast. Here  we report the isolation of a cDNA encoding human Dbp5 (hDbp5) which is 46% identical  to yDbp5p. Like its yeast homologue, hDbp5 is localized within the cytoplasm and at  the nuclear rim. By immunoelectron microscopy, the nuclear envelope-bound fraction  of Dbp5 has been localized to the cytoplasmic fibrils of the nuclear pore complex  (NPC). Consistent with this localization, we show that both the human and yeast  proteins directly interact with an N-terminal region of the nucleoporins  CAN/Nup159p. In a conditional yeast strain in which Nup159p is degraded when shifted  to the nonpermissive temperature, yDbp5p dissociates from the NPC and localizes to  the cytoplasm. Thus, Dbp5 is recruited to the NPC via a conserved interaction with  CAN/Nup159p. To investigate its function, we generated defective hDbp5 mutants and  analysed their effects in RNA export by microinjection in Xenopus oocytes. A mutant  protein containing a Glu-->Gln change in the conserved DEAD-box inhibited the  nuclear exit of mRNAs. Together, our data indicate that Dbp5 is a conserved  RNA-dependent ATPase which is recruited to the cytoplasmic fibrils of the NPC where  it participates in the export of mRNAs out of the nucleus.",

        "Title": "New discoveries of old SON: a link between RNA splicing and cancer.",
        "Abstract": "The SON protein is a ubiquitously expressed DNA- and RNA-binding protein primarily  localized to nuclear speckles. Although several early studies implicated SON in  DNA-binding, tumorigenesis and apoptosis, functional significance of this protein  had not been recognized until recent studies discovered SON as a novel RNA splicing  co-factor. During constitutive RNA splicing, SON ensures efficient intron removal  from the transcripts containing suboptimal splice sites. Importantly, SON-mediated  splicing is required for proper processing of selective transcripts related to cell  cycle, microtubules, centrosome maintenance, and genome stability. Moreover, SON  regulates alternative splicing of RNAs from the genes involved in apoptosis and  epigenetic modification. In addition to the role in RNA splicing, SON has an ability  to suppress transcriptional activation at certain promoter/enhancer DNA sequences.  Considering the multiple SON target genes which are directly involved in cell  proliferation, genome stability and chromatin modifications, SON is an emerging  player in gene regulation during cancer development and progression. Here, we  summarize available information from several early studies on SON, and highlight  recent discoveries describing molecular mechanisms of SON-mediated gene regulation.  We propose that our future effort on better understanding of diverse SON functions  would reveal novel targets for cancer therapy.",

Hodge and  colleagues (pp. 1052-1064) and Noble and colleagues (pp. 1065-1077) now describe a  novel model for Dbp5's ATPase cycle in mRNA (messenger RNA)/protein complex (mRNP)  remodeling during nuclear export. Notably, unlike other DEAD-box proteins, Dbp5 uses  a conformational change distinct from ATP hydrolysis for its activity and requires  an ADP release factor to reset its ATPase cycle.",

        "Abstract": "Nuclear speckles are self-assembled organelles composed of RNAs and proteins. They  are proposed to act as structural domains that control distinct steps in gene  expression, including transcription, splicing and mRNA export. Earlier studies  identified differential localization of a few components within the speckles. It was  speculated that the spatial organization of speckle components might contribute  directly to the order of operations that coordinate distinct processes. Here, by  performing multi-color structured illumination microscopy, we characterized the  multilayer organization of speckles at a higher resolution. We found that SON and  SC35 (also known as SRSF2) localize to the central region of the speckle, whereas  MALAT1 and small nuclear (sn)RNAs are enriched at the speckle periphery.  Coarse-grained simulations indicate that the non-random organization arises due to  the interplay between favorable sequence-encoded intermolecular interactions of  speckle-resident proteins and RNAs. Finally, we observe positive correlation between  the total amount of RNA present within a speckle and the speckle size. These results  imply that speckle size may be regulated to accommodate RNA accumulation and  processing. Accumulation of RNA from various actively transcribed speckle-associated  genes could contribute to the observed speckle size variations within a single cell.",

        "Abstract": "Nuclear export of mRNA in eukaryotic cells is mediated by soluble transport factors  and components of the nuclear pore complex (NPC). The cytoplasmically oriented  nuclear pore protein Nup159 plays a critical role in mRNA export through its  conserved N-terminal domain (NTD). Here, we report the crystal structure of the  Nup159 NTD, refined to 2.5 A. The structure reveals an unusually asymmetric  seven-bladed beta-propeller that is structurally conserved throughout eukarya. Using  structure-based conservation analysis, we have targeted specific surface residues  for mutagenesis. Residue substitutions in a conserved loop of the NTD abolish in  vitro binding to Dbp5, a DEAD box helicase required for mRNA export. In vivo, these  mutations cause Dbp5 mislocalization and block mRNA export. These findings suggest  that the Nup159 NTD functions in mRNA export as a binding platform, tethering  shuttling Dbp5 molecules at the nuclear periphery and locally concentrating this  mRNA remodeling factor at the cytoplasmic face of the NPC.",

        "Title": "Nucleoporin FG domains facilitate mRNP remodeling at the cytoplasmic face of the  nuclear pore complex.",
        "Abstract": "Directional export of messenger RNA (mRNA) protein particles (mRNPs) through nuclear  pore complexes (NPCs) requires multiple factors. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the  NPC proteins Nup159 and Nup42 are asymmetrically localized to the cytoplasmic face  and have distinct functional domains: a phenylalanine-glycine (FG) repeat domain  that docks mRNP transport receptors and domains that bind the DEAD-box ATPase Dbp5  and its activating cofactor Gle1, respectively. We speculated that the Nup42 and  Nup159 FG domains play a role in positioning mRNPs for the terminal mRNP-remodeling  steps carried out by Dbp5. Here we find that deletion (\u0394) of both the Nup42 and  Nup159 FG domains results in a cold-sensitive poly(A)+ mRNA export defect. The  nup42\u0394FG nup159\u0394FG mutant also has synthetic lethal genetic interactions with dbp5  and gle1 mutants. RNA cross-linking experiments further indicate that the nup42\u0394FG  nup159\u0394FG mutant has a reduced capacity for mRNP remodeling during export. To  further analyze the role of these FG domains, we replaced the Nup159 or Nup42 FG  domains with FG domains from other Nups. These FG \"swaps\" demonstrate that only  certain FG domains are functional at the NPC cytoplasmic face. Strikingly, fusing  the Nup42 FG domain to the carboxy-terminus of Gle1 bypasses the need for the  endogenous Nup42 FG domain, highlighting the importance of proximal positioning for  these factors. We conclude that the Nup42 and Nup159 FG domains target the mRNP to  Gle1 and Dbp5 for mRNP remodeling at the NPC. Moreover, these results provide key  evidence that character and context play a direct role in FG domain function and  mRNA export.",

        "Abstract": "Helicases are ubiquitous essential enzymes which have significant role in the  nucleic acid metabolism. Using in silico approaches in the recent past we have  identified a number of helicases in the Plasmodium falciparum genome. In the present  study we report purification and detailed characterization of a novel helicase from  P. falciparum. Our results indicate that this helicase is a homologue of Dbp5 and  DDX19 from yeast and human, respectively. The biochemical characterization shows  that it contains DNA and RNA unwinding, nucleic acid dependent ATPase and RNA  binding activities. It is interesting to note that this enzyme can unwind DNA  duplexes in both 5' to 3' and 3' to 5' directions. Using truncated derivatives we  further show that Q motif is essentially required for all of its activities. These  studies should make an important contribution in understanding the enzymes involved  in nucleic acid metabolism in the parasite.",

        "Abstract": "Gene expression dynamics can be measured in single living cells. Using a detectable  transcriptionally active gene in living cells, we previously found that an mRNA  undergoing several splicing events was retained at this gene after transcription  until completion of mRNA processing. To determine the reason for this delay in  release and whether mRNA retention on the gene might depend on splicing factor  availability, we modulated the levels of splicing factors in the nucleus. Increasing  the abundance of the diffusing fraction of splicing factors by their overexpression  or by Clk1 kinase overexpression to disassemble nuclear speckles, led to a reduction  in splicing factor residence times on the active gene, and the retained mRNA was  rapidly released from the gene. Other treatments such as overexpression of a mutant  inactive Clk1, the downregulation of MALAT1 lncRNA or of the Son protein, or the  overexpression of the splicing factor import factor TNPO3, did not affect the  dynamics of mRNA release from the gene. We found that the faster release of the mRNA  from the gene mediated by increased availability of splicing factors, was dependent  on the RS domain of the splicing factors and its phosphorylation state. We propose  that the relative abundancies of splicing factors in the nucleoplasm can affect  their availability for the splicing events taking place, and regulate the kinetics  of mRNA release from the gene after processing.",

        "Abstract": "The unidirectional translocation of messenger RNA (mRNA) through the aqueous channel  of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) is mediated by interactions between soluble mRNA  export factors and distinct binding sites on the NPC. At the cytoplasmic side of the  NPC, the conserved mRNA export factors Gle1 and inositol hexakisphosphate (IP(6))  play an essential role in mRNA export by activating the ATPase activity of the  DEAD-box protein Dbp5, promoting localized messenger ribonucleoprotein complex  remodeling, and ensuring the directionality of the export process. In addition,  Dbp5, Gle1, and IP(6) are also required for proper translation termination. However,  the specificity of the IP(6)-Gle1 interaction in vivo is unknown. Here, we  characterize the biochemical interaction between Gle1 and IP(6) and the relationship  to Dbp5 binding and stimulation. We identify Gle1 residues required for IP(6)  binding and show that these residues are needed for IP(6)-dependent Dbp5 stimulation  in vitro. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Gle1 is the primary target of IP(6) for  both mRNA export and translation termination in vivo. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae  cells, the IP(6)-binding mutants recapitulate all of the mRNA export and translation  termination defects found in mutants depleted of IP(6). We conclude that Gle1  specifically binds IP(6) and that this interaction is required for the full  potentiation of Dbp5 ATPase activity during both mRNA export and translation  termination.",

        "Abstract": "The human DEAD-box RNA-helicase DDX19 functions in mRNA export through the nuclear  pore complex. The yeast homolog of this protein, Dbp5, has been reported to  participate in translation termination. Using a reconstituted mammalian in vitro  translation system, we show that the human protein DDX19 is also important for  translation termination. It is associated with the fraction of translating  ribosomes. We show that DDX19 interacts with pre-termination complexes (preTCs) in a  nucleotide-dependent manner. Furthermore, DDX19 increases the efficiency of  termination complex (TC) formation and the peptide release in the presence of  eukaryotic release factors. Using the eRF1(AGQ) mutant protein or a non-hydrolysable  analog of GTP to inhibit subsequent peptidyl-tRNA hydrolysis, we reveal that the  activation of translation termination by DDX19 occurs during the stop codon  recognition. This activation is a result of DDX19 binding to preTC and a concomitant  stabilization of terminating ribosomes. Moreover, we show that DDX19 stabilizes  ribosome complexes with translation elongation factors eEF1 and eEF2. Taken  together, our findings reveal that the human RNA helicase DDX19 actively  participates in protein biosynthesis.",

        "Abstract": "SON is a DNA- and RNA-binding protein localized in nuclear speckles. Although its  function in RNA splicing for effective cell cycle progression and genome stability  was recently unveiled, other mechanisms of SON functions remain unexplored. Here, we  report that SON regulates GATA-2, a key transcription factor involved in  hematopoietic stem cell maintenance and differentiation. SON is highly expressed in  undifferentiated hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells and leukemic blasts. SON  knockdown leads to significant depletion of GATA-2 protein with marginal  down-regulation of GATA-2 mRNA. We show that miR-27a is up-regulated upon SON  knockdown and targets the 3'-UTR of GATA-2 mRNA in hematopoietic cells.  Up-regulation of miR-27a was due to activation of the promoter of the  miR-23a\u223c27a\u223c24-2 cluster, suggesting that SON suppresses this promoter to lower the  microRNAs from this cluster. Our data revealed a previously unidentified role of SON  in microRNA production via regulating the transcription process, thereby modulating  GATA-2 at the protein level during hematopoietic differentiation.",

        "Abstract": "Eukaryotic mRNAs are exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm as complex  mRNA-protein particles (mRNPs), and translocation through the nuclear pore complex  (NPC) is accompanied by extensive structural changes of the mRNP. We have tested the  hypothesis that the DEAD-box ATPase Dbp5p is required for such an mRNP  rearrangement. In dbp5 mutant cells, the mRNA export receptor Mex67p accumulates on  mRNA. This aberrant accumulation of Mex67p with RNA and the cold-sensitive growth  phenotype of a dbp5 allele are suppressed by a mex67 mutation. Moreover, Mex67 bound  mRNA accumulates at the nuclear rim in a temperature-sensitive dbp5 mutant when the  nuclear exosome is impaired. Importantly, although accumulation of Mex67p-containing  mRNPs is also observed when a nuclear basket component is mutated, these mRNPs still  contain the nuclear export factor Yra1p. In contrast, the dbp5-trapped mRNPs lack  Yra1p. We propose that Dbp5p's function is specifically required to displace Mex67p  from exported mRNPs, thus terminating export.",

        "Abstract": "Polyadenylation regulation and efficient nuclear export of mature mRNPs both require  the polyadenosine-RNA-binding protein, Nab2, which contains seven CCCH Zn fingers.  We describe here the solution structure of fingers 5-7, which are necessary and  sufficient for high-affinity polyadenosine-RNA binding, and identify key residues  involved. These Zn fingers form a single structural unit. Structural coherence is  lost in the RNA-binding compromised Nab2-C437S mutant, which also suppresses the  rat8-2 allele of RNA helicase Dbp5. Structure-guided Nab2 variants indicate that  dbp5(rat8-2) suppression is more closely linked to hyperadenylation and suppression  of mutant alleles of the nuclear RNA export adaptor, Yra1, than to affinity for  polyadenosine-RNA. These results indicate that, in addition to modulating polyA tail  length, Nab2 has an unanticipated function associated with generating  export-competent mRNPs, and that changes within fingers 5-7 lead to suboptimal  assembly of mRNP export complexes that are more easily disassembled by Dbp5 upon  reaching the cytoplasm.",

Here,  we describe the methods used in our laboratory to characterize the DEAD-box ATPase  Dbp5 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Dbp5 is essential for the process of mRNA export  in budding yeast and highly conserved orthologs can be found in all eukaryotes.  Specifically, we describe enzyme assays to measure the catalytic activity of Dbp5 in  association with RNA and known binding partners, as well as assays developed to  measure the binding affinities and release kinetics of RNA and adenosine nucleotides  from Dbp5. These assays have provided important information that has shaped our  current models of Dbp5 function in mRNA export and should be useful for the  characterization of other DEAD-box family members.",

        "Abstract": "The RNA export factor Mex67 is essential for the transport of mRNA through the  nuclear pore complex (NPC) in yeast, but the molecular mechanism of this export  process remains poorly understood. Here, we use quantitative fluorescence microscopy  techniques in live budding yeast cells to investigate how Mex67 facilitates mRNA  export. We show that Mex67 exhibits little interaction with mRNA in the nucleus and  localizes to the NPC independently of mRNA, occupying a set of binding sites offered  by FG repeats in the NPC. The ATPase Dbp5, which is thought to remove Mex67 from  transcripts, does not affect the interaction of Mex67 with the NPC. Strikingly, we  find that the essential function of Mex67 is spatially restricted to the NPC since a  fusion of Mex67 to the nucleoporin Nup116 rescues a deletion of MEX67 Thus, Mex67  functions as a mobile NPC component, which receives mRNA export substrates in the  central channel of the NPC to facilitate their translocation to the cytoplasm.",

        "Title": "Observing phthalate leaching from plasticized polymer films at the molecular level.",
        "Abstract": "Phthalates, the most widely used plasticizers in poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC), have  been extensively studied. In this paper, a highly sensitive, easy, and effective  method was developed to examine short-term phthalate leaching from PVC/phthalate  films at the molecular level using sum frequency generation vibrational spectroscopy  (SFG). Combining SFG and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), surface and  bulk molecular structures of PVC/phthalate films were also comprehensively evaluated  during the phthalate leaching process under various environments. The leaching  processes of two phthalates, diethyl phthalate (DEP) and dibutyl phthalate (DBP),  from the PVC/phthalate films with various weight ratios were studied. Oxygen plasma  was applied to treat the PVC/phthalate film surfaces to verify its efficacy on  preventing/reducing phthalate leaching from PVC. Our results show that DBP is more  stable than DEP in PVC/phthalate films. Even so, DBP molecules were still found to  very slowly leach to the environment from PVC at 30 \u00b0C, at a rate much slower than  DEP. Also, the bulk DBP content substantially influences the DBP leaching. Higher  DBP bulk concentration yields less stable DBP molecules in the PVC matrix, allowing  molecules to leach from the polymer film more easily. Additionally, DBP leaching is  very sensitive to temperature changes; higher temperature can strongly enhance the  leaching process. For most cases, the oxygen plasma treatment can effectively  prevent phthalate leaching from PVC films (e.g., for samples with low bulk  concentrations of DBP-5 and 30 wt %). It is also capable of reducing phthalate  leaching from high DBP bulk concentration PVC samples (e.g., 70 wt % DBP in PVC/DBP  mixture). This research develops a highly sensitive method to detect chemicals at  the molecular level as well as provides surface and bulk molecular structural  changes. The method developed here is general and can be applied to detect small  amounts of chemical/biological environmental contaminants.",

        "Abstract": "Serine-arginine-rich (SR) proteins play a key role in alternative pre-mRNA splicing  in eukaryotes. We recently showed that a large SR protein called Son has unique  repeat motifs that are essential for maintaining the subnuclear organization of  pre-mRNA processing factors in nuclear speckles. Motif analysis of Son highlights  putative RNA interaction domains that suggest a direct role for Son in pre-mRNA  splicing. Here, we used in situ approaches to show that Son localizes to a reporter  minigene transcription site, and that RNAi-mediated Son depletion causes exon  skipping on reporter transcripts at this transcription site. A genome-wide exon  microarray analysis was performed to identify human transcription and splicing  targets of Son. Our data show that Son-regulated splicing encompasses all known  types of alternative splicing, the most common being alternative splicing of  cassette exons. We confirmed that knockdown of Son leads to exon skipping in  pre-mRNAs for chromatin-modifying enzymes, including ADA, HDAC6 and SetD8. This  study reports a comprehensive view of human transcription and splicing targets for  Son in fundamental cellular pathways such as integrin-mediated cell adhesion, cell  cycle regulation, cholesterol biosynthesis, apoptosis and epigenetic regulation of  gene expression.",

        "Abstract": "Coordination of the multiple steps of mRNA biogenesis helps to ensure proper  regulation of gene expression. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae DEAD-box protein  Rat8p/Dbp5p is an essential mRNA export factor that functions at the nuclear pore  complex (NPC) where it is thought to remodel mRNA/protein complexes during mRNA  export. Rat8p also functions in translation termination and has been implicated in  functioning during early transcription. We conducted a synthetic genetic array  analysis (SGA) using a strain harboring the temperature-sensitive rat8-2 allele.  Although RAT8 had been shown to interact genetically with >15 other genes, we  identified >40 additional genes whose disruption in a rat8-2 background causes  synthetic lethality or dramatically reduced growth. Included were five that encode  components of P-bodies, sites of cytoplasmic mRNA turnover and storage. Wild-type  Rat8p localizes to NPCs and diffusely throughout the cell but rat8-2p localized to  cytoplasmic granules at nonpermissive temperature that are distinct from P-bodies.  In some genetic backgrounds, these granules also contain poly(A)-binding protein,  Pab1p, and additional mRNA export factors. Although these foci are distinct from  P-bodies, the two merge under heat-stress conditions. We suggest that these granules  reflect defective mRNP remodeling during mRNA export and during cytoplasmic mRNA  metabolism.",

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: With the rapid development of genetic detection technology, especially  next-generation sequencing, identification of the aetiology of unexplained  intellectual disabilities accompanied by seizures and other dysmorphic features has  become possible. The purpose of our paper is to make a definitive diagnosis of a  girl with neonatal hypotonia, severe global developmental delay, seizures and mild  facial dysmorphism. METHODS: The clinical data of the patient were retrospectively  studied. Whole-exome sequencing was performed on a blood sample from the patient.  Subsequently, Sanger sequencing was utilized for validation of variants and parental  validation. RESULTS: The patient had hypotonia since the neonatal period. She showed  a significant delay in physical and psychomotor development. She did not have any  speech until the age of 2\u00a0years and 6\u00a0months. She had seizures that were easy to  control with levetiracetam. The craniocerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) then  showed mild delayed myelination, enlarged bilateral ventricles and widened  frontotemporal extracerebral space. Interictal video electroencephalogram (VEEG) was  normal. She had esotropia and mild facial abnormalities with a flat nasal bridge and  a short nose. She showed no abnormalities in the heart, genitourinary or skeletal  systems. Whole-exome sequencing revealed a novel de novo variant c.5334_5335delAG  (p. Arg1778Serfs*11) in the SON gene.

        "Abstract": "3-(4-(Benzo[d]thiazol-2-yl)-1-phenyl-1H-pyrazol-3-yl) phenyl acetate (DPB-5) is a  synthetic benzothiazole derivative. In the present study, we revealed that DPB-5 had  strong cytotoxicity to induce cell apoptosis, which was mediated by ROS. And DPB-5  was more cytotoxic toward hepatoma cells than toward normal hepatic cells, which was  resulted from the greater susceptibility of the malignant cells to ROS. DBP-5 caused  massive ROS accumulation and GSH decrease, which lead to MMP disruption, caspase  activation and finally induced cell apoptosis. Additionally, rotenone, an inhibitor  of mitochondria electron transport system, effectively blocked the ROS elevated  effect of DPB-5, which suggested that DPB-5-induced ROS generated from the  mitochondria. Further studies showed that DPB-5-induced cell apoptosis through  caspases-cascade, but failed to activate caspase-9. Hence, we concluded that  DPB-5-induced Hep G2 cells apoptosis via a ROS-mediated pathway which was  caspase-dependent but did not rely on caspase-9.",

        "Title": "RNA export factor Ddx19 is required for nuclear import of the SRF coactivator MKL1.",
        "Abstract": "Controlled transport of macromolecules between the cytoplasm and nucleus is  essential for homeostatic regulation of cellular functions. For instance, gene  expression entails coordinated nuclear import of transcriptional regulators to  activate transcription and nuclear export of the resulting messenger RNAs for  cytoplasmic translation. Here we link these two processes by reporting a novel role  for the mRNA export factor Ddx19/Dbp5 in nuclear import of MKL1, the  signal-responsive transcriptional activator of SRF. We show that Ddx19 is not a  general nuclear import factor, and that its specific effect on MKL1 nuclear import  is separate from its role in mRNA export. Both helicase and nuclear pore-binding  activities of Ddx19 are dispensable for MKL1 nuclear import, but RNA binding is  required. Mechanistically, Ddx19 operates by modulating the conformation of MKL1,  which affects its interaction with Importin-\u03b2 for efficient nuclear import. Thus,  Ddx19 participates in mRNA export, translation and nuclear import of a key  transcriptional regulator.",

        "Title": "Translation termination: new factors and insights.",
        "Abstract": "In eukaryotes, translation termination requires two eukaryotic release factors, eRF1  and eRF3. eRF1 is required for recognition of the stop codon and eRF3 supports the  polypeptide chain release in a GTP dependent manner. Recently, several new players  in translation termination have been identified. The DEAD-box RNA helicase Dbp5 has  been shown to support eRF1 in stop codon recognition, possibly by proper placement  of the release factor on the termination codon. Upon its dissociation from eRF1,  Dbp5 allows the entry of the second termination factor eRF3 into the complex.  Further, the Dbp5 interacting protein Gle1 and its co-factor inositol  hexakisphosphate (IP 6) have been shown to participate in the termination process.  Dbp5 and Gle1 are well known for their function in mRNA export from the nucleus to  the cytoplasm. Most interestingly, also the ATP binding cassette (ABC) protein Rli1,  which requires the mitochondrial and cytosolic Fe/S protein biogenesis machineries  for its assembly, has recently been shown to function in translation termination and  recycling of the ribosomes. Rli1 physically and genetically interacts with both,  eRF1 and eRF3. Together, all of these novel termination factors modulate in  association with the release factors more accurate stop codon recognition and these  findings broaden our knowledge about the final steps in translation.",

        "Abstract": "Nuclear export of mRNA is a key transport process in eukaryotic cells. To  investigate it, we labeled native mRNP particles in living Chironomus tentans  salivary gland cells with fluorescent hrp36, the hnRNP A1 homolog, and the nuclear  envelope by fluorescent NTF2. Using light sheet microscopy, we traced single native  mRNA particles across the nuclear envelope. The particles were observed to often  probe nuclear pore complexes (NPC) at their nuclear face, and in only 25% of the  cases yielded actual export. The complete export process took between 65 ms up to  several seconds. A rate-limiting step was observed, which could be assigned to the  nuclear basket of the pore and might correspond to a repositioning and unfolding of  mRNPs before the actual translocation. Analysis of single fluorescent Dbp5  molecules, the RNA helicase essential for mRNA export, revealed that Dbp5 most often  approached the cytoplasmic face of the NPC, and exhibited a binding duration of  approximately 55 ms. Our results have allowed a refinement of the current models for  mRNA export.",

        "Abstract": "The interphase nucleus is a highly ordered and compartmentalized organelle. Little  is known regarding what elaborate mechanisms might exist to explain these properties  of the nucleus. Also unresolved is whether some architectural components might  facilitate the formation of functional intranuclear compartments or higher order  chromatin structure. As the first step to address these questions, we performed an  in-depth proteome analysis of nuclear insoluble fractions of human HeLa-S3 cells  prepared by two different approaches: a high-salt/detergent/nuclease-resistant  fraction and a lithium 3,5-diiodosalicylate/nuclease-resistant fraction. Proteins of  the fractions were analyzed by liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem  mass spectrometry, identifying 333 and 330 proteins from each fraction respectively.  Among the insoluble nuclear proteins, we identified 37 hitherto unknown or  functionally uncharacterized proteins. The RNA recognition motif, WD40 repeats, HEAT  repeats and the SAP domain were often found in these identified proteins. The  subcellular distribution of selected proteins, including DEK protein and SON  protein, demonstrated their novel associations with nuclear insoluble materials,  corroborating our MS-based analysis. This study establishes a comprehensive catalog  of the nuclear insoluble proteins in human cells. Further functional analysis of the  proteins identified in our study will significantly improve our understanding of the  dynamic organization of the interphase nucleus.",

        "Abstract": "It has been suspected that cell-cycle progression might be functionally coupled with  RNA processing. However, little is known about the role of the precise splicing  control in cell-cycle progression. Here, we report that SON, a large Ser/Arg  (SR)-related protein, is a splicing cofactor contributing to efficient splicing of  cell-cycle regulators. Downregulation of SON leads to severe impairment of spindle  pole separation, microtubule dynamics, and genome integrity. These molecular defects  result from inadequate RNA splicing of a specific set of cell-cycle-related genes  that possess weak splice sites. Furthermore, we show that SON facilitates the  interaction of SR proteins with RNA polymerase II and other key spliceosome  components, suggesting its function in efficient cotranscriptional RNA processing.  These results reveal a mechanism for controlling cell-cycle progression through  SON-dependent constitutive splicing at suboptimal splice sites, with strong  implications for its role in cancer and other human diseases.",

        "Title": "The DExH/D box protein HEL/UAP56 is essential for mRNA nuclear export in Drosophila.",
        "Abstract": "Dbp5 is the only member of the DExH/D box family of RNA helicases that is directly  implicated in the export of messenger RNAs from the nucleus of yeast and vertebrate  cells. Dbp5 localizes in the cytoplasm and at the cytoplasmic face of the nuclear  pore complex (NPC). In an attempt to identify proteins present in a highly enriched  NPC fraction, two other helicases were detected: RNA helicase A (RHA) and UAP56.  This suggested a role for these proteins in nuclear transport. Contrary to  expectation, we show that the Drosophila homolog of Dbp5 is not essential for mRNA  export in cultured Schneider cells. In contrast, depletion of HEL, the Drosophila  homolog of UAP56, inhibits growth and results in a robust accumulation of  polyadenylated RNAs within the nucleus. Consequently, incorporation of  [35S]methionine into newly synthesized proteins is inhibited. This inhibition  affects the expression of both heat-shock and non-heat-shock mRNAs, as well as  intron-containing and intronless mRNAs. In HeLa nuclear extracts, UAP56  preferentially, but not exclusively, associates with spliced mRNAs carrying the exon  junction complex (EJC). We conclude that HEL is essential for the export of bulk  mRNA in Drosophila. The association of human UAP56 with spliced mRNAs suggests that  this protein might provide a functional link between splicing and export.",

        "Abstract": "The SON gene, which maps to human chromosome 21q22.1-q22.2, encodes a novel  regulatory protein. Here we describe the organization of the Son locus in the mouse  genome. The mouse Son gene spans a region of approximately 35 kb. The coding region  is more than 8 kb in length and has been completely sequenced. The gene is organized  into 11 coding exons and 1 noncoding 3'UTR exon, with over 70% of the coding region  residing in one 5.7-kb exon. The gene contains at least one alternative exon, N/C  exon 1, which can be used, by splicing, to generate a truncated form of the SON  protein. Further investigation of the mouse Son locus has identified the genes  directly flanking Son. The glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase gene, Gart,  is encoded 5' of Son in a head-to-head arrangement, with the start of both genes  lying within 899 bp. Sequence comparison with the expressed sequence tagged database  identified a novel gene within 65 bp of the 3' end of Son, which we have named  Donson. In this unusually compact gene cluster, we have found overlap in the pattern  of expression between Gart, Son, and Donson. However, at least two of these genes  have very different functions. While GART is involved in purine biosynthesis, we  find that SON shows the characteristics of \"SR- type\" proteins, which are involved  in mRNA processing and gene expression.",

        "Title": "Physical and genetic interactions link the yeast protein Zds1p with mRNA nuclear  export.",
        "Abstract": "Eukaryotic gene expression requires the export of mRNA from the nucleus to the  cytoplasm. The DEAD box protein Dbp5p is an essential export factor conserved from  yeast to man. A fraction of Dbp5p forms a complex with nucleoporins of the  cytoplasmic filaments of the nuclear pore complex. Gfd1p was identified originally  as a multicopy suppressor of the rat8-2 ts allele of DBP5. Here we reported that  Dbp5p and Gfd1p interact with Zds1p, a protein previously identified as a multicopy  suppressor in several yeast genetic screens. By using the two-hybrid system, we  showed that Zds1p interacts in vivo with both Gfd1p and Dbp5p. In vitro binding  experiments revealed that Gfd1p and Dbp5p bind directly to the C-terminal part of  Zds1p. In addition, ZDS1 interacted genetically with mutant alleles of genes  encoding key factors in mRNA export, including DBP5 and MEX67. Furthermore, deletion  of ZDS1 or of both ZDS1 and the closely related ZDS2 exacerbated the poly(A)+ export  defects shown by dbp5-2 and mex67-5 mutants. We proposed that Zds1p associates with  the complex formed by Dbp5p, Gfd1p, and nucleoporins at the cytosolic fibrils of the  nuclear pore complex and is required for optimal mRNA export.",

        "Abstract": "Vitamin D-binding protein (DBP) has an anabolic effect on the skeleton and  reportedly enhances bone ingrowth. We used an in vivo critical bone defect model to  determine whether local administration of DBP promotes bone defect healing. We  created a 5-mm segmental bone defect in the radial shaft in a rat model. Forty-eight  rats were assigned to eight groups: local application of 1 microg, 5 microg, 10  microg, or 50 microg DBP (DBP-1, DBP-5, DBP-10, DBP-50), autogenous bone marrow  mononuclear cells with or without 10 microg DBP (BM-DBP-10, BM), 80 microg BMP-2  delivered in gelatin sponge (BMP-2), and the sham operated group. Radiographic  evaluation, histological stains, and epifluorescence microscopy were performed.  Grossly, all bone gaps of the BMP-2 group were solidly bridged by callus, while all  those in the sham operated group remained unhealed by 9 weeks. Only one specimen of  the BM-DBP-10 and DBP-50 groups and three specimens of the BM group were solidly  healed; pseudarthroses occurred in all of the other specimens. Histological study  and radiographs of the specimens showed similar results. We did not observe the  enhanced bone healing reported in a previous study.",

Transcription factors and  epigenetic modifiers are known to play important roles in the maintenance of  pluripotency of hESCs. However, little is known about regulation of pluripotency  through splicing. In this study, we identify the spliceosome-associated factor SON  as a factor essential for the maintenance of hESCs. Depletion of SON in hESCs  results in the loss of pluripotency and cell death. Using genome-wide RNA profiling,  we identified transcripts that are regulated by SON. Importantly, we confirmed that  SON regulates the proper splicing of transcripts encoding for pluripotency  regulators such as OCT4, PRDM14, E4F1 and MED24. Furthermore, we show that SON is  bound to these transcripts in\u00a0vivo. In summary, we connect a splicing-regulatory  network for accurate transcript production to the maintenance of pluripotency and  self-renewal of hESCs.",

        "Abstract": "Nuclear export of mRNA is mediated by interactions between soluble factors and  nuclear pore complex (NPC) proteins. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Nab2 is an  essential RNA-binding protein that shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm. The  mechanism for trafficking of Nab2-bound mRNA through the NPC has not been defined.  Gle1 is also required for mRNA export, and Gle1 interactions with NPC proteins, the  RNA helicase Dbp5, and Gfd1 have been reported. Here we report that Nab2, Gfd1, and  Gle1 associate in a complex. By using immobilized recombinant Gfd1, Nab2 was  isolated from total yeast lysate. A similar biochemical assay with immobilized  recombinant Nab2 resulted in coisolation of Gfd1 and Gle1. A Nab2-Gfd1 complex was  also identified by coimmunoprecipitation from yeast lysates. In vitro binding assays  with recombinant proteins revealed a direct association between Nab2 and Gfd1, and  two-hybrid assays delineated Gfd1 binding to the N-terminal Nab2 domain. This  N-terminal Nab2 domain is distinct from its RNA binding domains suggesting Nab2  could bind Gfd1 and RNA simultaneously. As Nab2 export was blocked in a gle1 mutant  at the restrictive temperature, we propose a model wherein Gfd1 serves as a bridging  factor between Gle1 and Nab2-bound mRNA during export.",

        "Title": "Transcription repression of human hepatitis B virus genes by negative regulatory  element-binding protein/SON.",
        "Abstract": "A negative regulatory element (NRE) is located immediately upstream of the upstream  regulatory sequence of core promoter and second enhancer of human hepatitis B virus  (HBV). NRE represses the transcription activation function of the upstream  regulatory sequence of core promoter and the second enhancer. In this study, we  described the cloning and characterization of an NRE-binding protein (NREBP) through  expression cloning. NREBP cDNA is 8266 nucleotides in size and encodes a protein of  2386 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 262 kDa. Three previously  described cDNAs, DBP-5, SONB, and SONA, are partial sequence and/or alternatively  spliced forms of NREBP. The genomic locus of the NREBP/SON gene is composed of 13  exons and 12 introns. The endogenous NREBP protein is localized in the nucleus of  human hepatoma HuH-7 cells. Antibody against NREBP protein can specifically block  the NRE binding activity present in fractionated nuclear extracts in gel shifting  assays, indicating that NREBP is the endogenous nuclear protein that binds to NRE  sequence. By polymerase chain reaction-assisted binding site selection assay, we  determined that the consensus sequence for NREBP binding is GA(G/T)AN(C/G)(A/G)CC.  Overexpression of NREBP enhances the repression of the HBV core promoter activity  via NRE. Overexpression of NREBP can also repress the transcription of HBV genes and  the production of HBV virions in a transient transfection system that mimics the  viral infection in vivo.",

        "Abstract": "Pre-mRNA splicing requires proper splice site selection mediated by many factors  including snRNPs and serine-arginine rich (SR) splicing factors. Our lab previously  reported that the SR-like protein SON maintains organization of pre-mRNA splicing  factors in nuclear speckles as well as splicing of many human transcripts including  mRNAs coding for the chromatin-modifying enzymes HDAC6, ADA and SETD8. However, the  mechanism by which SON maintains accurate splicing is unknown. To build tools for  understanding SON-dependent pre-mRNA splicing, we constructed a minigene reporter  plasmid driving expression of the genomic sequence spanning exons 26 through 29 of  HDAC6. Following SON depletion, we observed altered splicing of HDAC6 reporter  transcripts that showed exclusion of exons 27 and 28, reflecting the splicing  patterns of endogenous HDAC6 mRNA. Importantly, loss of HDAC6 biological function  was also observed, as indicated by truncated HDAC6 protein and corresponding absence  of aggresome assembly activities of HDAC6 binding-of-ubiquitin zinc finger (BUZ)  domain. We therefore propose that SON-mediated splicing regulation of HDAC6 is  essential for supporting protein degradation pathways that prevent human disease.",

        "Abstract": "Gene expression requires proper messenger RNA (mRNA) export and translation.  However, the functional links between these consecutive steps have not been fully  defined. Gle1 is an essential, conserved mRNA export factor whose export function is  dependent on the small molecule inositol hexakisphosphate (IP(6)). Here, we show  that both Gle1 and IP(6) are required for efficient translation termination in  Saccharomyces cerevisiae and that Gle1 interacts with termination factors. In  addition, Gle1 has a conserved physical association with the initiation factor eIF3,  and gle1 mutants display genetic interactions with the eIF3 mutant nip1-1.  Strikingly, gle1 mutants have defects in initiation, whereas strains lacking IP(6)  do not. We propose that Gle1 functions together with IP(6) and the DEAD-box protein  Dbp5 to regulate termination. However, Gle1 also independently mediates initiation.  Thus, Gle1 is uniquely positioned to coordinate the mRNA export and translation  mechanisms. These results directly impact models for perturbation of Gle1 function  in pathophysiology.",

        "Title": "[Regulation of insulin receptor expression and its gene].",
        "Abstract": "The insulin receptor is a membrane macromolecule whose expression on the cell  surface is essential for cell sensitivity to insulin. Current knowledge on the  regulation of expression of the insulin receptor and its gene in human and animal  cells is presented. Although ubiquitously distributed, the insulin receptor and its  messenger RNA (mRNA) are mainly expressed in metabolically active cells such as  hepatocytes and adipocytes. Two receptor isoforms, generated by alternative splicing  of exon 11, have been identified. Isoform B (exon 11+) predominates in liver and  adipocytes, and isoform A (exon 11-) in brain, spleen and leukocytes. In vivo and in  several cell models, the expression of the insulin receptor and/or its mRNA is under  positive regulation by glucocorticoid hormones and negative regulation by insulin.  Glucocorticoid hormones stimulate receptor gene transcription and receptor protein  synthesis. Insulin stimulates receptor protein degradation and, in certain cell  types, decreases receptor mRNA level. Vanadate (an insulinomimetic agent) corrects,  in vivo, the hyperexpression of the liver receptor observed in experimental  insulinopenic diabetes, but its effects on receptor expression in vitro are complex  and vary with the cell type. In vivo the insulin receptor and/or its mRNA are  expressed early in fetal development with a high level, in liver, of isoform A.  Maximal expression is reached at the end of gestation and then decreases after  birth. In several cell models, receptor protein and/or mRNA expression is affected  by cell growth and/or differentiation. Several cis- and trans-acting factors  regulating the expression of the human insulin receptor gene and its response to  glucocorticoid hormones have been identified.",

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Zhu-Tokita-Takenouchi-Kim syndrome is a severe multisystem developmental  disorder characterized by intellectual disability, developmental delay,  malformations of the cerebral cortex, epilepsy, vision problems, musculoskeletal  abnormalities, and congenital malformations. This syndrome is caused by heterozygous  pathogenic variants in the SON gene at chromosome 21q22.1. OBJECTIVES: The aim of  this study was to investigate the pathogenesis of a 4-year-old Chinese child who  displayed severe intellectual disability, delayed psychomotor development, and  facial dysmorphism. METHODS: A sequential detection including chromosome  karyotyping, chromosome microarray analysis (CMA), and whole-exome sequencing (WES)  was performed on this child. The familial verification of WES result was conducted  by Sanger sequencing. RESULTS: A de novo frameshift variant SON: c.5230delC  (p.Arg1744ValfsTer29) was identified in the proband. The identical variant was not  found in his family members. The frequencies of this variant in gnomAD/gnomAD_EAS  databases were both none. CONCLUSIONS: This study substantiates that SON: c.5230delC  (p.Arg1744ValfsTer29) is a pathogenic variant of Zhu-Tokita-Takenouchi-Kim syndrome  and it is the first time to report Zhu-Tokita-Takenouchi-Kim syndrome in China.",

        "Abstract": "To extend our cDNA project for accumulating basic information on unidentified human  genes, we newly determined the sequences of 100 cDNA clones from a set of  size-fractionated human adult and fetal brain cDNA libraries, and predicted the  coding sequences of the corresponding genes, named KIAA1019 to KIAA1118. The  sequencing of these clones revealed that the average size of the inserts and  corresponding open reading frames were 5.0 kb and 2.6 kb (880 amino acid residues),  respectively. Database search of the predicted amino acid sequences classified 58  predicted gene products into the five functional categories, such as cell  signaling/communication, cell structure/motility, nucleic acid management, protein  management and cell division. It was also found that, for 34 gene products,  homologues were detected in the databases, which were similar in sequence through  almost the entire regions. The chromosomal locations of the genes were determined by  using human-rodent hybrid panels unless their mapping data were already available in  the public databases. The expression profiles of all the genes among 10 human  tissues, 8 brain regions (amygdala, corpus callosum, cerebellum, caudate nucleus,  hippocampus, substania nigra, subthalamic nucleus, and thalamus), spinal cord, fetal  brain and fetal liver were also examined by reverse transcription-coupled polymerase  chain reaction, products of which were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent  assay.",

        "Abstract": "SON is a key component of the spliceosomal complex and a critical mediator of  constitutive and alternative splicing. Additionally, SON has been shown to influence  cell-cycle progression, genomic integrity, and maintenance of pluripotency in stem  cell populations. The clear functional relevance of SON in coordinating essential  cellular processes and its presence in diverse human tissues suggests that intact  SON might be crucial for normal growth and development. However, the phenotypic  effects of deleterious germline variants in SON have not been clearly defined.  Herein, we describe seven unrelated individuals with de novo variants in SON and  propose that deleterious variants in SON are associated with a severe multisystem  disorder characterized by developmental delay, persistent feeding difficulties, and  congenital malformations, including brain anomalies.",

However, the missing heritability is evident and  the contributions of coding variants have not yet been systematically evaluated.  Here, we present a large-scale whole-exome array analysis for psoriasis consisting  of 42,760 individuals. We discover 16 SNPs within 15 new genes/loci associated with  psoriasis, including C1orf141, ZNF683, TMC6, AIM2, IL1RL1, CASR, SON, ZFYVE16,  MTHFR, CCDC129, ZNF143, AP5B1, SYNE2, IFNGR2 and 3q26.2-q27 (P<5.00 \u00d7 10(-08)). In  addition, we also replicate four known susceptibility loci TNIP1, NFKBIA, IL12B and  LCE3D-LCE3E. These susceptibility variants identified in the current study  collectively account for 1.9% of the psoriasis heritability. The variant within AIM2  is predicted to impact protein structure. Our findings increase the number of  genetic risk factors for psoriasis and highlight new and plausible biological  pathways in psoriasis.",

        "Title": "Mechanism of ATP turnover inhibition in the EJC.",
        "Abstract": "The exon junction complex (EJC) is deposited onto spliced mRNAs and is involved in  many aspects of mRNA function. We have recently reconstituted and solved the crystal  structure of the EJC core made of MAGOH, Y14, the most conserved portion of MLN51,  and the DEAD-box ATPase eIF4AIII bound to RNA in the presence of an ATP analog. The  heterodimer MAGOH/Y14 inhibits ATP turnover by eIF4AIII, thereby trapping the EJC  core onto RNA, but the exact mechanism behind this remains unclear. Here, we present  the crystal structure of the EJC core bound to ADP-AIF(3), the first structure of a  DEAD-box helicase in the transition-mimicking state during ATP hydrolysis. It  reveals a dissociative transition state geometry and suggests that the locking of  the EJC onto the RNA by MAGOH/Y14 is not caused by preventing ATP hydrolysis. We  further show that ATP can be hydrolyzed inside the EJC, demonstrating that MAGOH/Y14  acts by locking the conformation of the EJC, so that the release of inorganic  phosphate, ADP, and RNA is prevented. Unifying features of ATP hydrolysis are  revealed by comparison of our structure with the EJC-ADPNP structure and other  helicases. The reconstitution of a transition state mimicking complex is not limited  to the EJC and eIF4AIII as we were also able to reconstitute the complex  Dbp5-RNA-ADP-AlF(3), suggesting that the use of ADP-AlF(3) may be a valuable tool  for examining DEAD-box ATPases in general.",

        "Title": "Leukemia/lymphoma-related factor, a POZ domain-containing transcriptional repressor,  interacts with histone deacetylase-1 and inhibits cartilage oligomeric matrix  protein gene expression and chondrogenesis.",
        "Abstract": "Mutations in the human cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) gene have been  linked to the development of pseudoachondroplasia and multiple epiphyseal dysplasia.  We previously cloned the promoter region of the COMP gene and delineated a minimal  negative regulatory element (NRE) that is both necessary and sufficient to repress  its promoter (Issack, P. S., Fang, C. H., Leslie, M. P., and Di Cesare, P. E. (2000)  J. Orthop. Res. 18, 345-350; Issack, P. S., Liu, C. J., Prazak, L., and Di Cesare,  P. E. (2004) J. Orthop. Res. 22, 751-758). In this study, a yeast one-hybrid screen  for proteins that associate with the NRE led to the identification of the  leukemia/lymphoma-related factor (LRF), a transcriptional repressor that contains a  POZ (poxvirus zinc finger) domain, as an NRE-binding protein. LRF bound directly to  the NRE both in vitro and in living cells. Nine nucleotides (GAGGGTCCC) in the 30-bp  NRE are essential for binding to LRF. LRF showed dose-dependent inhibition of  COMP-specific reporter gene activity, and exogenous overexpression of LRF repressed  COMP gene expression in both rat chondrosarcoma cells and bone morphogenetic  protein-2-treated C3H10T1/2 progenitor cells. In addition, LRF also inhibited bone  morphogenetic protein-2-induced chondrogenesis in high density micromass cultures of  C3H10T1/2 cells, as evidenced by lack of expression of other chondrocytic markers,  such as aggrecan and collagen types II, IX, X, and XI, and by Alcian blue staining.  LRF associated with histone deacetylase-1 (HDAC1), and experiments utilizing the  HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A revealed that LRF-mediated repression requires  deacetylase activity. LRF is the first transcription factor found to bind directly  to the COMP gene promoter, to recruit HDAC1, and to regulate both COMP gene  expression and chondrogenic differentiation.",

        "Abstract": "The gene for cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) encodes a noncollagenous  matrix protein that is expressed predominantly in cartilage. COMP gene expression is  deficient in the Sox9-null mouse, but the molecular mechanism remains unknown. We  have previously delineated a 30-bp negative regulatory element (NRE) and a 51-bp  positive regulatory element (PRE) in the regulatory region of the COMP gene.  Subsequently we isolated LRF transcription repressor as an NRE-binding protein and  established that LRF inhibits COMP gene expression via recruiting histone  deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) to the COMP promoter. In this study we demonstrated that Sox9,  an essential transcription factor of chondrogenesis, binds to the COMP promoter at  the PRE in which 13 nucleotides (TGTTTACCTTGTG) are required for the binding of  Sox9. Sox9 activates COMP gene expression and this activation is PRE-dependent. Sox9  is required for COMP gene expression during chondrogenesis, since repression of Sox9  expression using the small interfering RNA approach inhibited COMP gene expression.  In addition, activation of COMP gene expression by Sox9 requires the participation  of transcription factors Sox5 and Sox6 as well as the coactivators CBP and p300  histone acetylase. It appears that there exists a balance between LRF repressor and  Sox9 activator in the control of COMP gene, since transactivation of COMP gene by  Sox9 was abolished by the coexpression of LRF, and excess Sox9 overcame the  LRF-mediated inhibition. This study provides the first evidence that Sox9 directly  associates with COMP gene promoter and that mediation of COMP gene activation by  Sox9 involves Sox5, Sox6, CBP, and p300 coactivators.",

        "Abstract": "Transcriptional regulation of the interferon-beta (IFN-beta) gene is characterized  by strict constitutive repression and virus-specific activation. Previous studies  have shown that the IFN-beta promoter is constitutively repressed by a negative  regulatory element (NRE). Isolated NRE acts as a constitutive and  position-independent silencer on the NF-kappaB-binding sites. Here, we describe the  identification and functional characterization of the NRE-binding protein, called  NRF (NF-kappaB-repressing factor), which abolishes the transcriptional activity of  the bordering NF-kappaB- binding sites by a distance-independent mechanism. Deletion  studies show that a minimal repression domain of NRF is sufficient to exert its  inhibitory effect. In vitro, NF-kappaB proteins bind to purified NRF by a direct  protein-protein interaction. We demonstrate that NRF is a ubiquitous and  constitutive nuclear protein. In fibroblasts, the expression of the NRF antisense  RNA releases the endogenous IFN-beta gene transcription. Our data strongly suggest  that the NRF-mediated inhibition of NF-kappaB is a critical component of the  IFN-beta gene silencing prior to viral infection.",

        "Title": "Disruption of the NHR4 domain structure in AML1-ETO abrogates SON binding and  promotes leukemogenesis.",
        "Abstract": "AML1-ETO is generated from t(8;21)(q22;q22), which is a common form of chromosomal  translocation associated with development of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Although  full-length AML1-ETO alone fails to promote leukemia because of its detrimental  effects on cell proliferation, an alternatively spliced isoform, AML1-ETO9a, without  its C-terminal NHR3/NHR4 domains, strongly induces leukemia. However, full-length  AML1-ETO is a major form of fusion product in many t(8;21) AML patients, suggesting  additional molecular mechanisms of t(8;21)-related leukemogenesis. Here, we report  that disruption of the zinc-chelating structure in the NHR4 domain of AML1-ETO by  replacing only one critical amino acid leads to rapid onset of leukemia,  demonstrating that the NHR4 domain with the intact structure generates inhibitory  effects on leukemogenesis. Furthermore, we identified SON, a DNA/RNA-binding domain  containing protein, as a novel NHR4-interacting protein. Knock-down of SON by siRNA  resulted in significant growth arrest, and disruption of the interaction between  AML1-ETO and endogenous SON rescued cells from AML1-ETO-induced growth arrest,  suggesting that SON is an indispensable factor for cell growth, and AML1-ETO binding  to SON may trigger signals inhibiting leukemogenesis. In t(8;21) AML patient-derived  primary leukemic cells and cell lines, abnormal cytoplasmic localization of SON was  detected, which may keep cells proliferating in the presence of full-length  AML1-ETO. These results uncovered the crucial role of the NHR4 domain in  determination of cellular fate during AML1-ETO-associated leukemogenesis.",

        "Title": "Assortative weight gain in mother-daughter and father-son pairs: an emerging source  of childhood obesity. Longitudinal study of trios (EarlyBird 43).",
        "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To look for same-sex (gender assortative) association of body mass index  (BMI) in healthy trios (mother, father and child) from a contemporary birth cohort,  which might imply shared environment rather than shared genes because selective  mother-daughter and father-son gene transmission is not a common Mendelian trait.  DESIGN: Prospective (longitudinal) cohort study with four annual time points, from 5  to 8 years. SUBJECTS: 226 healthy trios from a 1995 to 1996 birth cohort randomly  selected in the city of Plymouth, UK. MEASUREMENTS: Average BMI of the two parents  and maternal/paternal BMI separately related to the BMI-SDS (standard deviation  score) of all offspring and to the BMI-SDS of the sons and the daughters separately.  RESULTS: There were big differences in BMI-SDS among the daughters grouped according  to mothers' category of BMI (effect size 1.37 SDS), but not their sons (effect size  0.16 SDS, gender interaction P<0.004), and among the sons grouped according to their  fathers' BMI (effect size 1.28 SDS), but not their daughters (effect size 0.17,  gender interaction P=0.02). Children whose same-sex parents were of normal weight,  weighed either close to (girls+0.20 BMI-SDS) or less than (boys,-0.34 BMI-SDS)  children of 20 years ago, and did not change from 5 to 8 years. In contrast, the  risks of obesity at 8 years were 10-fold greater (girls 41%, P<0.001) or sixfold  greater (boys 18%, P<0.05) if the same-sex parent was obese. Longitudinal linear  mixed effects (multilevel) modelling showed a marked influence of maternal and  paternal BMI on the rate of weight gain, which was unaffected by birth weight of the  child. We report perhaps the largest effect sizes so far recorded in childhood  obesity. CONCLUSIONS: Childhood obesity today seems to be largely confined to those  whose same-sex parents are obese, and the link does not seem to be genetic. Parental  obesity, like smoking, might be targeted in the interests of the child.",

        "Abstract": "To identify Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes important for nucleocytoplasmic export of  messenger RNA, we screened mutant strains to identify those in which poly(A)+ RNA  accumulated in nuclei under nonpermissive conditions. We describe the identification  of DBP5 as the gene defective in the strain carrying the rat8-1 allele (RAT =  ribonucleic acid trafficking). Dbp5p/Rat8p, a previously uncharacterized member of  the DEAD-box family of proteins, is closely related to eukaryotic initiation factor  4A(eIF4A) an RNA helicase essential for protein synthesis initiation. Analysis of  protein databases suggests most eukaryotic genomes encode a DEAD-box protein that is  probably a homolog of yeast Dbp5p/Rat8p. Temperature-sensitive alleles of DBP5/RAT8  were prepared. In rat8 mutant strains, cells displayed rapid, synchronous  accumulation of poly(A)+ RNA in nuclei when shifted to the non-permissive  temperature. Dbp5p/Rat8p is located within the cytoplasm and concentrated in the  perinuclear region. Analysis of the distribution of Dbp5p/Rat8p in yeast strains  where nuclear pore complexes are tightly clustered indicated that a fraction of this  protein associates with nuclear pore complexes (NPCs). The strong mutant phenotype,  association of the protein with NPCs and genetic interaction with factors involved  in RNA export provide strong evidence that Dbp5p/Rat8p plays a direct role in RNA  export.",

        "Abstract": "The vitamin D binding protein/Gc-globulin (DBP) gene is a member of a multigene  cluster that includes albumin (ALB), alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), and  alpha-albumin/afamin (AFM). All four genes have structural and functional  similarities and map to the same chromosomal regions in humans (4q11-q13), mice, and  rats. An accurate physical map of the region encompassing these genes is a  prerequisite for study of their respective transcriptional regulation and  identification of potential shared regulatory elements. By refining the physical and  meiotic maps of the 4q11-q13 region and creating a local PAC contig, the order and  transcriptional orientations of these four genes were determined to be  centromere-3'-DBP-5'-5'-ALB-3'-5'-AFP-3'-5'-AFM3'-telomere. The ancestral DBP gene  was separated from the ALB gene by >1.5 Mb. This organization and spacing  establishes a foundation for ongoing functional studies in this region.",

        "Title": "The helC gene encodes a putative DEAD-box RNA helicase required for development in  Dictyostelium discoideum.",
        "Abstract": "DEAD-box RNA helicases, defined by the sequence Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp (DEAD, in  single-letter amino-acid code), regulate RNA unwinding and secondary structure in an  ATP-dependent manner in vitro [1] and control mRNA stability and protein  translation. Both yeast and mammals have large families of DEAD-box proteins, many  of unknown function. We have disrupted a Dictyostelium discoideum gene, helC, which  encodes helicase C, a member of the DEAD-box family of RNA helicases that shows  strong homology to the product of the essential Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene dbp5  [2] and to related helicases in mouse and Schizosaccharomyces pombe. The HelC  protein also shows weaker homology to the translation initiation factor elF-4a.  Other DEAD-box-containing proteins, which are less closely related to HelC, have  been implicated in developmental roles in Drosophila [3] and Xenopus laevis; one  example is the Xenopus Vasa-like protein (XVLP) [4-6]. In Drosophila and Xenopus,  Vasa and XVLP, respectively, are required for the establishment of tissue polarity  during development. In yeast, DEAD-box helicases such as Prp8 [7] are components of  the spliceosome and connect pre-mRNA splicing with the cell cycle. Disruption of the  helC gene in D. discoideum led to developmental asynchrony, failure to differentiate  and aberrant morphogenesis. We postulate that one reason for the existence of large  families of homologous DEAD-box proteins in yeast, mammals and Dictyostelium could  be that some DEAD-box proteins have developmentally specific roles regulating  protein translation or mRNA stability.",

        "Abstract": "Germline stem cells (GSCs) are attractive biological models because of their strict  control on pluripotency gene expression, and their potential for huge epigenetic  changes in a short period of time. Few data exists on the cooperative impact of  GSC-specific genes on differentiated cells. In this study, we over-expressed 3  GSC-specific markers, STELLA, OCT4 and NANOS2, collectively designated as (SON),  using the novel polycistronic lentiviral gene construct FUM-FD, in HEK293T cells and  evaluated promoter activity of the Stra8 GSC marker gene We could show that HEK293T  cells expressed pluripotency and GSC markers following ectopic expression of the SON  genes. We also found induction of pluripotency markers after serum starvation in  non-transduced HEK293T cells. Expression profiling of SON-expressing and  serum-starved cells at mRNA and protein level showed the potential of SON factors  and serum starvation in the induction of ESRRB, NANOG, OCT4 and REX1 expression.  Additionally, the data indicated that the mouse Stra8 promoter could only be  activated in a subpopulation of HEK293T cells, regardless of SON gene expression. We  conclude that heterogeneous population of the HEK293T cells might be easily shifted  towards expression of the pluripotency markers by ectopic expression of the SON  factors or by growth in serum depleted media.",

        "Title": "Targeting of MAPK-associated molecules identifies SON as a prime target to attenuate  the proliferation and tumorigenicity of pancreatic cancer cells.",
        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer is characterized by constitutive activation of  mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Activation of MAPK is associated with the  upregulation of genes implicated in the proliferation and survival of pancreatic  cancer cells. We hypothesized that knockdown of these MAPK-associated molecules  could produce notable anticancer phenotypes. METHODS: A RNA interference-mediated  knockdown screening of 78 MAPK-associated molecules previously identified was  performed to find molecules specifically associated with proliferation of pancreatic  cancer cells in vitro. Expression of an identified molecule in pancreatic cancer  tissues was examined by immunohistochemistry. In vivo tumorigenicity of cancer cells  with stable knockdown of the molecule was assayed by using xenograft models. Flow  cytometry and live cell imaging were employed to assess an association of the  molecule with cell cycle. RESULTS: The knockdown screening revealed that knockdown  of SON, the gene encoding SON, which is a large serine/arginine-rich protein  involved in RNA processing, substantially suppressed pancreatic cancer cell  proliferation and survival in vitro and tumorigenicity in vivo. SON expression was  higher in ductal adenocarcinomas than in cells of normal ducts and precursor lesions  in pancreatic cancer tissues. Knockdown of SON induced G2/M arrest and apoptosis in  cultured cancer cells. The suppressive effect of SON knockdown on proliferation was  less pronounced in cultured normal duct epithelial cells. SON formed nuclear  speckles in the interphase of the cell cycle and dispersed in the cytoplasm during  mitosis. Live cell imaging showed that SON diffusely dispersed in the early mitotic  phase, accumulated in some foci in the cytoplasm in the late mitotic phase, and  gradually reassembled into speckles after mitosis. CONCLUSION: These results  indicate that SON plays a critical role in the proliferation, survival, and  tumorigenicity of pancreatic cancer cells, suggesting that SON is a novel  therapeutic molecular target for pancreatic cancer.",

        "Title": "SON is a spliceosome-associated factor required for mitotic progression.",
        "Abstract": "The eukaryotic RNA splicing machinery is dedicated to the daunting task of excising  intronic sequences on the many nascent RNA transcripts in a cell, and in doing so  facilitates proper translation of its transcriptome. Notably, emerging evidence  suggests that RNA splicing may also play direct roles in maintaining genome  stability. Here we report the identification of the RNA/DNA-binding protein SON as a  component of spliceosome that plays pleiotropic roles during mitotic progression. We  found that SON is essential for cell proliferation, and that its inactivation  triggers a MAD2-dependent mitotic delay. Moreover, SON deficiency is accompanied by  defective chromosome congression, compromised chromosome segregation and  cytokinesis, which in turn contributes to cellular aneuploidy and cell death. In  summary, our study uncovers a specific link between SON and mitosis, and highlights  the potential of RNA processing as additional regulatory mechanisms that govern cell  proliferation and division.",

        "Abstract": "A P element enhancer trap screen was conducted to identify genes involved in  dorsal-ventral boundary formation in Drosophila. The son of Notch (son) gene was  identified by the son(2205) enhancer trap insertion, which is a partial  loss-of-function mutation. Based on son(2205) mutant phenotypes and genetic  interactions with Notch and wingless mutations, we conclude that son participates in  wing development, and functions in the Notch signaling pathway at the dorsal-ventral  boundary in the wing. Notch signaling pathway components activate son enhancer trap  expression in wing cells. son enhancer trap expression is regulated positively by  wingless, and negatively by cut in boundary cells. Ectopic Son protein induces  wingless and cut expression in wing discs. We hypothesize that there is positive  feedback regulation of son by wingless, and negative regulation by cut at the  dorsal-ventral boundary during wing development.",

        "Abstract": "The early EICP0 protein is a powerful trans-activator that activates all classes of  equine herpesvirus 1 (EHV-1) promoters but, unexpectedly, trans-activates its own  promoter very weakly. Transient transfection assays that employed constructs  harboring deletions within the EICP0 promoter indicated that EICP0 cis-acting  sequences within bp -224 to -158 relative to the first ATG abolished the EICP0  protein's trans-activation of its own promoter. When inserted into the promoters of  other EHV-1 genes, this sequence also downregulated activation of the  immediate-early IE(-169/+73), early thymidine kinase TK(-215/+97), and late  glycoprotein K gK(-83/+14) promoters, indicating that the cis-acting sequence (-224  to -158) downregulated expression of representative promoters of all classes of  EHV-1 genes and contains a negative regulatory element (NRE). To define the  cis-acting element(s), three synthetic oligonucleotides (Na [bp -224 to -195], Nb  [bp -204 to -177], and Nc [bp -185 to -156]) were synthesized and cloned upstream of  the EICP0(-157/-21) promoter. Of the three synthetic sequences, only the Nb  oligonucleotide caused the downregulation of the EICP0 promoter. The NRE was  identified as a 28-bp element to lie at -204 to -177 that encompassed the sequence  of ([-204]AGATACAGATGTTCGATAAATTGGAACC[-177]). Gel shift assays performed with mouse  L-M, rabbit RK-13, and human HeLa cell nuclear extracts and gamma-(32)P-labeled  wild-type and mutant NREs demonstrated that a ubiquitous nuclear protein(s)  (NRE-binding protein, NREBP) binds specifically to a sequence (bp -193 to -183) in  the NRE. The NREBP is also present in the nucleus of EHV-1-infected cells; however,  the amount of NREBP in EHV-1-infected L-M cells that bound to the Nb oligonucleotide  was reduced compared to that in uninfected L-M cells. Transient transfection assays  showed that deletions or mutations within the NREBP-binding site abolished the NRE  activity of the EICP0 promoter. These results suggested that the NREBP may mediate  the NRE activity of the EICP0 promoter and may function in the coordinate expression  of EHV-1 genes.",

        "Abstract": "Production of inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) by Ipk1, the  inositol-1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate 2-kinase, is required for Gle1-mediated mRNA  export in Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells. To examine the network of interactions  that require IP6 production, an analysis of fitness defects was conducted in mutants  harboring both an ipk1 null allele and a mutant allele in genes encoding  nucleoporins or transport factors. Enhanced lethality was observed with a specific  subset of mutants, including nup42, nup116, nup159, dbp5, and gle2, all of which had  been previously connected to Gle1 function. Complementation of the  nup116Deltaipk1Delta and nup42Deltaipk1Delta double mutants did not require the  Phe-Gly repeat domains in the respective nucleoporins, suggesting that IP6 was  acting subsequent to heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein targeting to the  nuclear pore complex. With Nup42 and Nup159 localized exclusively to the nuclear  pore complex cytoplasmic side, we speculated that IP6 may regulate a cytoplasmic  step in mRNA export. To test this prediction, the spatial requirements for the  production of IP6 were investigated. Restriction of Ipk1 to the cytoplasm did not  block IP6 production. Moreover, coincident sequestering of both Ipk1 and Mss4 (an  enzyme required for phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate production) to the  cytoplasm also did not block IP6 production. Given that the kinase required for  inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate production (Ipk2) is localized in the nucleus,  these results indicated that soluble inositides were diffusing between the nucleus  and the cytoplasm. Additionally, the cytoplasmic production of IP6 by plasma  membrane-anchored Ipk1 rescued a gle1-2 ipk1-4 synthetic lethal mutant. Thus,  cytoplasmic IP6 production is sufficient for mediating the Gle1-mRNA export pathway.",

        "Abstract": "The yeast DEAD-box protein Dbp5p/Rat8p is an essential factor for mRNA export and  shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. It is concentrated at the  cytoplasmic fibrils of the nuclear pore complex where it interacts with several  nucleoporins. On the basis of this localization, it has been suggested that it might  participate in a terminal step of RNA export, the release from the mRNA of proteins  that accompany the mRNA during translocation through nuclear pores. In this report,  we present evidence linking Dbp5p to transcription. Two different screens identified  genetic interactions between DBP5 and genes involved in early transcription events,  initiation and promoter clearance. Mutations of transcription proteins expected to  impair transcription act as suppressors of dbp5 mutants, whereas those that may act  to increase transcription are synthetically lethal with dbp5 mutations. We also show  that growth and mRNA export in dbp5 mutant strains are dependent on the  carboxy-terminal domain of the RNA pol II largest subunit. Finally, we show that  Dbp5p associates physically with components of transcription factor IIH. Because  these interactions affect not only growth but also mRNA export, they are likely to  reflect a functional relationship between Dbp5p and the transcription machinery.  Together, our results suggest a nuclear role for Dbp5 during the early steps of  transcription.",

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Zhu-Tokita-Takenouchi-Kim (ZTTK, OMIM# 617140) syndrome is a rare,  autosomal dominant genetic disorder caused by heterozygous variants in the SON gene  (OMIM#182465, GenBank#NC_000021.9). There are only 33 cases and 26 causative SON  variants reported to date since the first report in 2015. Here, we report a new case  of ZTTK syndrome and a de novo disease-causing SON variant. METHODS: We conducted  whole-exome sequencing (WES) to obtain genetic data of the patient. The clinical and  genetic data of the patient were analyzed. RESULTS: The clinical features of our  patient were strikingly similar to previously reported cases. Notably, our patient  had unique presentations, including a bridged palmar crease in the left hand and  growth hormone deficiency. The c.5297del de novo variant in SON causes an amino  change (p.Ser1766Leufs*7). CONCLUSION: Our report expands the mutant spectrum of the  SON gene and refines the genotype-phenotype map of ZTTK syndrome. Our findings also  highlighted the importance of WES for early diagnosis of ZTTK syndrome, which may  improve diagnostic procedures for affected individuals.",

        "Abstract": "The authors compared the properties of nonreceptor estrogen-binding protein (NREBP)  of the ovaries of immature rats, specific estrogen-binding protein (SEBP) of the  liver and alpha-fetoprotein (alpha-FP) of the rat blood serum. It was shown that all  3 proteins with moderate affinity bound 3H-estradiol (Ka approximately 10(8)M-1) and  were characterized by a high rate of interaction with ligand (K+1 approximately  10(6)M-1c-1) and dissociation of hormone-protein complexes (K-1 approximately  10(-2)c-1). NREBP and alpha-FP manifested a very close hormonal specificity of  affinity differing from SEBP specificity: both proteins bound intensively estrone  and estradiol, to a lesser degree, estriol, and did not bind androgens and  hexestrol. Stokes' radii of the molecules of 3 proteins were 4.4 and 2.5 nm,  respectively. Rabbit antiserum to alpha-FP suppressed the hormone-binding activity  of blood alpha-FP and ovarian NREBP but not liver SEBP. With growth of animals a  study of the time course of the levels of ovarian NREBP and blood alpha-FP has shown  that the presence of NREBP in the ovarian cytosol does not probably result from  blood proteins mechanical contamination of the sample in homogenization. It has been  assumed that intracellular alpha-FP or its close analog may be involved in the  regulation of ovarian endocrine function, reversibly binding estrogens.",

The 5-year event-free survival rate for high-risk medulloblastoma is low at  62% despite a multimodal therapy including surgical resection, radiation therapy and  chemotherapy. We report the case of a boy, who was born to consanguineous parents.  Prominently, he had multiple caf\u00e9-au-lait spots. At the age of 3\u00a0years he was  diagnosed with a high-risk metastatic medulloblastoma. The patient died only  11\u00a0months after diagnosis of a fulminant relapse presenting as meningeal and spinal  dissemination. Whole-exome sequencing of germline DNA was employed to detect the  underlying mutation for this putative cancer syndrome presenting with the  combination of medulloblastoma and skin alterations. After screening all possible  homozygous gene SNVs, we identified a mutation of SON, an essential protein in cell  cycle regulation and cell proliferation, as the most likely genetic cause.",

        "Abstract": "Translocation of mRNA through the nuclear pore complex (NPC) requires interactions  with different NPC regions. To determine the interactions that are crucial for  effective mRNA export in living cells, we examined mRNA export within individual  pores by applying various types of mRNA export blocks that stalled mRNPs at  different stages of transition. Focusing on the major mRNA export factor NXF1, we  found that initial mRNP binding to the NPC did not require NXF1 in the NPC, whereas  release into the cytoplasm did. NXF1 localization in the NPC did not require RNA or  RNA binding. Superresolution microscopy showed that NXF1 consistently occupied  positions on the cytoplasmic side of the NPC. Interactions with specific  nucleoporins were pinpointed using FLIM-FRET for measuring protein-protein  interactions inside single NPCs, showing that Dbp5 helicase activity of mRNA release  is conserved in yeast and humans. Altogether, we find that specific interactions on  the cytoplasmic side of the NPC are fundamental for the directional flow of mRNA  export.",

This coupling probably provides a quality control mechanism as well as  a higher efficiency for the synthesis of mRNAs. The mRNA is synthesized in the  nucleus and then exported to the cytoplasm through the nuclear pore complexes  (NPCs), which are embedded in the nuclear envelope. The Mex67-Mtr2 complex in yeast  and its counterpart Tap-p15 in higher eukaryotes function as an mRNA exporter  through the NPC. Some of the DEAD box proteins such as UAP56 and Dbp5 have been  implicated in mRNA export also. In this report using the bioinformatics approach we  have analyzed the components of the mRNA export machinery in Plasmodium falciparum  and also highlighted the salient features of some of the components. Further  detailed studies on various components of nuclear mRNA export in Plasmodium  falciparum will be essential to understand this important pathway.",

        "Title": "Crystal structure of the human eIF4AIII-CWC22 complex shows how a DEAD-box protein  is inhibited by a MIF4G domain.",
        "Abstract": "DEAD-box proteins are involved in all aspects of RNA processing. They bind RNA in an  ATP-dependent manner and couple ATP hydrolysis to structural and compositional  rearrangements of ribonucleoprotein particles. Conformational control is a major  point of regulation for DEAD-box proteins to act on appropriate substrates and in a  timely manner in vivo. Binding partners containing a middle domain of translation  initiation factor 4G (MIF4G) are emerging as important regulators. Well-known  examples are eIF4G and Gle1, which bind and activate the DEAD-box proteins eIF4A and  Dbp5. Here, we report the mechanism of an inhibiting MIF4G domain. We determined the  2.0-\u00c5 resolution structure of the complex of human eIF4AIII and the MIF4G domain of  the splicing factor Complexed With Cef1 (CWC22), an essential prerequisite for exon  junction complex assembly by the splicing machinery. The CWC22 MIF4G domain binds  both RecA domains of eIF4AIII. The mode of RecA2 recognition is similar to that  observed in the activating complexes, yet is specific for eIF4AIII. The way the  CWC22 MIF4G domain latches on the eIF4AIII RecA1 domain is markedly different from  activating complexes. In the CWC22-eIF4AIII complex, the RNA-binding and ATP-binding  motifs of the two RecA domains do not face each other, as would be required in the  active state, but are in diametrically opposite positions. The binding mode of CWC22  to eIF4AIII reveals a facet of how MIF4G domains use their versatile structural  frameworks to activate or inhibit DEAD-box proteins.",

        "Abstract": "Human son gene was previously identified by cloning and hybridization to GC-rich rat  genomic fragment. After several cycles of human placenta library walking we were  able to identify and clone two alternative transcripts of this gene. Recently we  have determined nucleotide sequence of small son gene transcript, coding region of  which contains four areas of complete tandem repeats. Here we report the structure  of the part (2.9 kb) of large transcript of son gene from close to its 5'-end to the  end of sequence, unique for this transcript. Comparison of nucleotide sequences of  two transcripts indicates that they have common 3'-ends and, probably, arise from  alternative splicing. 5' proximal part of large transcript contains two areas of  complete tandem repeats not present in small transcript. Results of analysis of this  area support our model for forming son gene tandem repeats structure by duplication,  mutation and natural selection at the protein level.",

        "Title": "The GLFG regions of Nup116p and Nup100p serve as binding sites for both Kap95p and  Mex67p at the nuclear pore complex.",
        "Abstract": "Our previous studies have focused on a family of Saccharomyces cerevisiae nuclear  pore complex (NPC) proteins that contain domains composed of repetitive tetrapeptide  glycine-leucine-phenylalanine-glycine (GLFG) motifs. We have previously shown that  the GLFG regions of Nup116p and Nup100p directly bind the karyopherin transport  factor Kap95p during nuclear protein import. In this report, we have further  investigated potential roles for the GLFG region in mRNA export. The subcellular  localizations of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged mRNA transport factors were  individually examined in yeast cells overexpressing the Nup116-GLFG region. The  essential mRNA export factors Mex67-GFP, Mtr2-GFP, and Dbp5-GFP accumulated in the  nucleus. In contrast, the localizations of Gle1-GFP and Gle2-GFP remained  predominantly associated with the NPC, as in wild type cells. The localization of  Kap95p was also not perturbed with GLFG overexpression. Coimmunoprecipitation  experiments from yeast cell lysates resulted in the isolation of a Mex67p-Nup116p  complex. Soluble binding assays with bacterially expressed recombinant proteins  confirmed a direct interaction between Mex67p and the Nup116-GLFG or Nup100-GLFG  regions. Mtr2p was not required for in vitro binding of Mex67p to the GLFG region.  To map the Nup116-GLFG subregion(s) required for Kap95p and/or Mex67p association,  yeast two-hybrid analysis was used. Of the 33 Nup116-GLFG repeats that compose the  domain, a central subregion of nine GLFG repeats was sufficient for binding either  Kap95p or Mex67p. Interestingly, the first 12 repeats from the full-length region  only had a positive interaction with Mex67p, whereas the last 12 were only positive  with Kap95p. Thus, the GLFG domain may have the capacity to bind both karyopherins  and an mRNA export factor simultaneously. Taken together, our in vivo and in vitro  results define an essential role for a direct Mex67p-GLFG interaction during mRNA  export.",

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The genetic etiology of intellectual and psychomotor disability without  a defined spectrum of dysmorphic features is usually monogenic. As no diagnostic  criteria for such diseases are established, the clinical diagnosis becomes to be a  challenge. The object of our paper is to present two patients with non-specific  clinical symptoms for whom whole-exome-sequencing identified the new SON mutations  and thus allowed for establishing the diagnosis of Zhu-Tokita-Takenouchi-Kim (ZTTK)  syndrome. In both patients, the same symptoms including hypotonia, developmental and  speech delay, feeding difficulties as well as frequent infections of the respiratory  tract and internal ear were observed. However, both cases presented also with  exceptional symptoms such as in case 1 ventriculomegaly and asymmetry of ventricles,  hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS), intellectual disability, intestinal  malrotation, gastroparesis, and duodenal atresia and in the case 2 febrile seizures  and reduced IgA levels. We will be presenting the patients and comparing them to 30  previously described cases. METHODS: Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed on  the probands' DNA and paired-end sequenced (2x100\u00a0bp) on HiSeq 1500. Variants  considered as disease-causing were validated in the proband and studied in all  available family members by amplicon deep sequencing performed using Nextera XT Kit  and sequenced on HiSeq 1500. RESULTS: We have identified two new variants in SON  gene. In case 1 it has been a heterozygous frameshift variant p.(Ala1340GlnfsTer26),  while in case 2 it has been a heterozygous frameshift variant, p.(Asp1640GlyfsTer7).  Both variants are described for the first time and up to now, are not mentioned in  any database. CONCLUSION: As there are no precise criteria established for the  clinical diagnosis of ZTTK, an identification of SON gene mutation by  whole-exome-sequencing is the best method that allows for a diagnosis of this  syndrome.",

        "Abstract": "The molecular characterization of antigens preferentially or exclusively expressed  by astrocytomas and recognized by the autologous immune system are a prerequisite  for the development of specific vaccines. To identify such antigens, we screened 5  cDNA expression libraries derived from astrocytomas and other gliomas for reactivity  with high-titered IgG antibodies in the sera of astrocytoma patients using SEREX,  the serologic identification of antigens by recombinant cDNA expression cloning.  Autologous and allogeneic SEREX analysis of >5 x 10(6) clones with the sera of 18  astrocytoma patients revealed 10 antigens: the differentiation antigen glial  fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), Bax-inhibitor 1 (which was overexpressed in all  glioma samples tested), 3 other molecules involved in the regulation of gene  expression and proliferation (the nm23-H2-encoded nucleoside diphosphate kinase B,  the Ran binding protein-2 and a DNA binding protein encoded by the son gene),  SP40,40 (a complement inhibitory molecule), the chaperonin TCP-1, calnexin and 2 new  gene products. No immune responses were detected against the \"shared tumor\" or  \"cancer testis antigens\" that are regularly expressed in gliomas. Antibody responses  in astrocytoma patients against antigens expressed by gliomas were rare and, with  the exception of Bax-inhibitor 1 and the product of the son gene, were also found in  apparently healthy controls. We conclude that although astrocytomas express a broad  spectrum of antigens, they elicit antibody responses only rarely, most likely  because of their intrinsic immunosuppressive effects.",

        "Title": "A redundant nuclear protein binding site contributes to negative regulation of the  mouse mammary tumor virus long terminal repeat.",
        "Abstract": "The tissue specificity of mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) expression is controlled  by regulatory elements in the MMTV long terminal repeat (LTR). These regulatory  elements include the hormone response element, located approximately between -200  and -75, as well as binding sites for NF-1, Oct-1 (OTF-1), and mammary gland  enhancer factors. Naturally occurring MMTV deletion variants isolated from T-cell  and kidney tumors, transgenic-mouse experiments with MMTV LTR deletions, and  transient transfection assays with LTR constructs indicate that there are additional  transcription regulatory elements, including a negative regulatory element (NRE),  located upstream of the hormone response element. To further define this regulatory  region, we have constructed a series of BAL 31 deletion mutants in the MMTV LTR for  use in transient transfection assays. These assays indicated that deletion of two  regions (referred to as promoter-distal and -proximal NREs) between -637 and -201  elevated basal MMTV promoter activity in the absence of glucocorticoids. The region  between -637 and -264 was surveyed for the presence of nuclear protein binding sites  by gel retardation assays. Only one type of protein complex (referred to as  NRE-binding protein or NBP) bound exclusively to sites that mapped to the  promoter-distal and -proximal NREs identified by BAL 31 mutations. The  promoter-proximal binding site was mapped further by linker substitution mutations  and transfection assays. Mutations that mapped to a region containing an inverted  repeat beginning at -287 relative to the start of transcription elevated basal  expression of a reporter gene driven by the MMTV LTR. A 59-bp DNA fragment from the  distal NRE also bound the NBP complex. Gel retardation assays showed that mutations  within both inverted repeats of the proximal NRE eliminated NBP binding and  mutations within single repeats altered NBP binding. Intriguingly, the NBP complex  was detected in extracts from T cells and lung cells but was absent from mammary  gland cells. These results suggest that a factor contributing to high-level  expression of MMTV in the mammary gland is the lack of negative regulation by NBP.",

        "Abstract": "A recent study of exome analyses in 109 patients with undiagnosed diseases included  a 5-year-old girl with intellectual disability and multiple congenital anomalies,  who had an apparently de novo frameshift mutation in SON. However, the combination  of the truncating mutation in SON and the phenotype has not been reproduced until  date, and it remains unclear if this combination represents a distinctive disease  entity. Here we report an additional male with intellectual disability, congenital  heart disease, distinctive facial features with curly hair and protruding ears, and  long slender extremities, and hyperextensible joints. Exome analysis showed that he  had the same de novo frameshift mutation in SON in a heterozygous state. Along with  the first and original description of the apparently de novo truncating mutation in  SON mentioned above, we have established that haploinsufficiency of SON causes a new  recognizable syndrome of intellectual disability. SON is located within 21q22.11, a  critical region for Braddock-Carey syndrome, which is characterized by congenital  thrombocytopenia, intellectual disability, micrognathia, and a distinctive facies.  Therefore, we suggest that the intellectual disability observed in Braddock-Carey  syndrome could be accounted for by haploinsufficiency of SON. \u00a9 2016 Wiley  Periodicals, Inc.",

        "Abstract": "AIM: To analyze differences in blood pressure levels in children and adolescents in  Galicia with those of peers living in other parts of Spain. DESIGN: Cross-sectional  study done in a rural area in Galicia. PARTICIPANTS: 870 boys and girls 6 to 16  years old. They are compared with published data from the RICARDIN study, that  includes 10,042 participants selected at the schools in nine centers of Spain (one  was the center in Galicia). MEASUREMENTS: Standardized methodology and certification  procedures were used in Galicia and Spain to measure weight, height, Qu\u00e9telet index,  systolic (SBP) and fifth-phase diastolic blood pressure (DBP5) and sexual  maturation. Data are presented by sex and age group (1 year) both in Galicia and  Spain. RESULTS: From 11 years and above, girls in Galicia present higher SBP than in  Spain. In boys, the difference appears later. Galicia shows higher DBP5 levels than  Spain in every age-sex group. In relation to obesity, the differences are of a small  magnitude in the Qu\u00e9telet index, again, higher values in Galicia. CONCLUSIONS: This  is the first population-based study available that rules out the possibility that  the observed differences, previously already suggested, could be attributed to  methodological problems. The differences in blood pressure and obesity between  Galicia and other areas of Spain, already previously suggested in adults, can be the  reflection of differences present from childhood.",

        "Abstract": "In an effort to identify trans-acting factors regulating specific genes, we cloned a  novel human gene, DBP-5. The cDNA clone contains a predicted open reading frame  coding for a potential 1,179 amino acid protein. The mRNA corresponding to DBP-5 is  ubiquitously distributed, and the gene is phylogenetically conserved.  Immunofluorescence analyses with several cell lines indicate that the protein is  localized to the nucleus. Sequence analysis revealed unusual features of the  predicted protein structure, including four completely conserved repeats. The  phylogenetic conservation of DBP-5, the ubiquity of its expression, its nuclear  localization, and its ability to bind DNA sequences, raise the possibility that  DBP-5 may play a role in the organization of interphase chromatin and/or in  transcriptional regulation.",

        "Title": "In vivo recruitment of exon junction complex proteins to transcription sites in  mammalian cell nuclei.",
        "Abstract": "Studies over the past years indicate that there is extensive coupling between  nuclear export of mRNA and pre-mRNA processing. Here, we visualized the distribution  of exon junction complex (EJC) proteins and RNA export factors relative to sites of  abundant pre-mRNA synthesis in the nucleus. We analyzed both HeLa cells infected  with adenovirus and murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells stably transfected with the  human beta-globin gene. Using in situ hybridization and confocal microscopy, we  observe accumulation of EJC proteins (REF/Aly, Y14, SRm160, UAP56, RNPS1, and Magoh)  and core spliceosome components (U snRNPs) at sites of transcription. This suggests  that EJC proteins bind stably to pre-mRNA cotranscriptionally. No concentration of  the export factors NXF1/TAP, p15, and Dbp5 was detected on nascent transcripts,  arguing that in mammalian cells these proteins bind the mRNA shortly before or after  release from the sites of transcription. These results also suggest that binding of  EJC proteins to the mRNA is not sufficient to recruit TAP-p15, consistent with  recent findings showing that the EJC does not play a crucial role in mRNA export.  Contrasting to the results obtained in MEL cells expressing normal human beta-globin  transcripts, mutant pre-mRNAs defective in splicing and 3'end processing do not  colocalize with SRm160, REF, UAP56, or Sm proteins. This shows that the accumulation  of EJC proteins at transcription sites requires efficient processing of the nascent  pre-mRNAs, arguing that transcription per se is not sufficient for the stable  assembly of the EJC.",

        "Abstract": "Despite the fact that the negative regulatory element (NRE) within the upstream  regulatory region of human IL-2 receptor alpha (IL-2Ralpha) gene has been identified  two decades ago, mechanisms of the NRE function on the gene are hitherto unknown. In  this paper, we report for the first time that the immunoglobulin transcription  factor 2B (ITF2B) encoded by transcription factor 4 (TCF4) gene is a NRE binding  protein. The full-length TCF4 cDNA clone was obtained from a HTLV-1 transformed  human peripheral T cell MACHERMAKER cDNA library with NRE as the bait in yeast  one-hybrid system. The NRE binding ability of ITF2B was further confirmed in  chromatin-immunoprecipitation assay. Competitive RT-PCR-based promoter activity  assay showed that over-expression of ITF2B protein inhibited the expression of  IL-2Ralpha gene in Jurkat cells in an NRE-dependent manner. The function of ITF2B on  the inhibition of both the IL-2Ralpha and the 5'LTR activity of HIV-1 shed light on  the essence of NRE binding protein as a potential target for immune therapy and  treatment in AIDS patients.",

        "Abstract": "Myo-inositol-1,2,3,4,5,6-hexakisphosphate (InsP(6)), also known as phytic acid,  accumulates in large quantities in plant seeds, serving as a phosphorus reservoir,  but is an animal antinutrient and an important source of water pollution. Here, we  report that Gle1 (GLFG lethal 1) in conjunction with InsP(6) functions as an  activator of the ATPase/RNA helicase LOS4 (low expression of osmotically responsive  genes 4), which is involved in mRNA export in plants, supporting the  Gle1-InsP(6)-Dbp5 (LOS4 homolog) paradigm proposed in yeast. Interestingly, plant  Gle1 proteins have modifications in several key residues of the InsP(6) binding  pocket, which reduce the basicity of the surface charge. Arabidopsis thaliana Gle1  variants containing mutations that increase the basic charge of the InsP(6) binding  surface show increased sensitivity to InsP(6) concentrations for the stimulation of  LOS4 ATPase activity in vitro. Expression of the Gle1 variants with enhanced InsP(6)  sensitivity rescues the mRNA export defect of the ipk1 (inositol  1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate 2-kinase) InsP(6)-deficient mutant and, furthermore,  significantly improves vegetative growth, seed yield, and seed performance of the  mutant. These results suggest that Gle1 is an important factor responsible for  mediating InsP(6) functions in plant growth and reproduction and that Gle1 variants  with increased InsP(6) sensitivity may be useful for engineering high-yielding  low-phytate crops.",

It is shown here that Dbp5p is an ATP-dependent RNA  helicase required for polyadenylated [poly(A)+] RNA export. Surprisingly, Dbp5p is  present predominantly, if not exclusively, in the cytoplasm, and is highly enriched  around the nuclear envelope. This observation raises the possibility that Dbp5p may  play a role in unloading or remodeling messenger RNA particles (mRNPs) upon arrival  in the cytoplasm and in coupling mRNP export and translation. The functions of Dbp5p  are likely to be conserved, since its potential homologues can be found in a variety  of eukaryotic cells.",

        "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To estimate the independent contribution of the blood pressure cuff  bladder width: mid-upper arm circumference (CW:AC) ratio to the variability in  systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure phase 4 (DBP4) and diastolic  blood pressure phase 5 (DBP5) in children and adolescents, and its impact upon the  estimate of prevalence of high blood pressure derived at screening. DESIGN: Use of  cuffs with a CW:AC ratio below 40% causes overestimation of the true blood pressure  level. With higher CW:AC ratios the level is underestimated. National  recommendations for adults state that the CW:AC ratio is optimal at approximately  40%, but no consistent recommendations exist for children. METHODS: We measured SBP  and diastolic blood pressure phases 4 and 5 in 811 boys and 771 girls aged 10-17  years (93% participation rate). In each subject the blood pressure was measured with  a cuff conforming to the 40% rule (recommended cuff), with one smaller (mean  decrease in the CW:AC ratio:7.4%), and with one larger (mean increase in the CW:AC  ratio:10.2%). Cuffs were used in random order. RESULTS: Smaller cuffs gave  significantly higher blood pressure readings. With the larger cuff there were  significant mean decreases. The differences were independent of the blood pressure  level obtained with the recommended cuff. The impact upon the estimate of the  prevalence of high blood pressure was substantial. CONCLUSIONS: Selection of the  proper cuff size is important for children and adolescents, in order to avoid both  over- and underdiagnosis of hypertension.",

        "Abstract": "This study determined age-specific patterns of blood pressure (BP) in Spanish  children aged 1-18 years for the purpose of developing BP guidelines for this  population. Age- and sex-specific BP levels were constructed by pooling data from 15  studies conducted in Spain. Pooled mean BP levels were then compared with those  reported by the US Second Task Force on Blood Pressure Control in Children and those  recently reported from a separate pooled analysis of the relevant published surveys  collected worldwide. In the Spanish data, the average 1-year age increment in  Systolic BP (SBP) was uniform for boys and girls until 13 years at 2 mmHg; for boys  aged 13-18 the increase was 1.3 mmHg/year; in contrast, girls reached their maximum  values at age 13 and the means remained basically unchanged for female adolescents.  Fifth-phase diastolic BP (DBP5) values showed a uniform increase for both boys and  girls from ages 6 to 18 years at 0.9 mmHg/year. In most age-sex subgroups, mean SBP  values were higher (7-8 mmHg on average) in Spain than in the US. However, Spanish  values for SBP were in general only slightly higher or approximately equal to those  for the international data, from ages 6 to 18 years. The patterns of change in SBP  with age differed somewhat in the three data sets. Comparisons for DBP were limited  to the age groups for which readings of DBP5 were available. For DBP5, only slight  differences between the Spanish and International pools were observed (ages 6-18  compared), but these values were notably higher than those from the US (ages 13-18  compared). These findings suggest that the use of any particular age-based standard  to evaluate readings in children in diverse populations cannot be recommended, at  least until there is a better understanding of the true differences in BP between  populations.",

        "Abstract": "In this paper we show that the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can be used on  regions of highly conserved genes, such as the 3' untranslated region (3' UTR) of  the SON gene, to identify the mammalian origin of a sample. Using this test, we have  been able to distinguish human, monkey, cat, dog, mouse and hamster DNAs. We have  also determined the DNA sequence of these different PCR products, which can be used  to reinforce species identification. The advantages of this test are that: (i) no  prior information is required on the possible species origin of a sample, (ii) the  reaction produces a single PCR product which varies in size according to the species  of origin, making the test simple to interpret, and (iii) the target region of DNA  amplified in these experiments is small and can easily be sequenced and sized using  automated techniques. This small size has enabled us to successfully amplify this  product from DNA extracted from compromised material (human bone samples) and so  demonstrate that the test is valuable for the characterisation of remains in which  DNA is degraded.",

        "Abstract": "Renin is synthesized in high quantities in the juxtaglomerular cells of the kidney,  but little or none is synthesized in the liver. Our previous in vitro and  biochemical studies have demonstrated that tissue-specific expression of the mouse  renin gene is regulated by the specific interaction between negative regulatory  element (NRE) in the 5'-flanking region of the renin gene and NRE binding protein  (NREB). In this study, we examined the hypothesis that this interaction between the  NRE in the promoter region of the rat renin gene and the NREB in the liver  contributes to the suppressed renin gene expression in this tissue in vivo. We used  in vivo transfection of NRE transcription factor decoy (TFD) double-stranded  oligonucleotide into the rat liver via portal vein infusion. A gel mobility shift  assay showed that transfected NRE TFD blocked endogenous NREB binding with the rat  renin gene. This resulted in enhanced hepatic renin mRNA expression,  immunohistochemical detection of renin in the liver, and consequently, increased  plasma renin concentration. Taken together, these results document the importance of  NREB in the inhibition of renin gene expression in rat liver in vivo and suggest the  possibility of in vivo renin gene modulation by the TFD approach.",

        "Abstract": "Telomerases protect the ends of linear chromosomes from shortening. They are  composed of an RNA (TLC1 in S. cerevisiae) and several proteins. TLC1 undergoes  several maturation steps before it is exported into the cytoplasm to recruit the Est  proteins for complete assembly. The mature telomerase is subsequently reimported  into the nucleus, where it fulfills its function on telomeres. Here, we show that  TLC1 export into the cytoplasm requires not only the Ran GTPase-dependent  karyopherin Crm1/Xpo1 but also the mRNA export machinery. mRNA export factor mutants  accumulate mature and export-competent TLC1 RNAs in their nuclei. Moreover, TLC1  physically interacts with the mRNA transport factors Mex67 and Dbp5/Rat8. Most  importantly, we show that the nuclear export of TLC1 is an essential step for the  formation of the functional RNA containing enzyme, because blocking TLC1 export in  the mex67-5 xpo1-1 double mutant prevents its cytoplasmic maturation and leads to  telomere shortening.",

        "Abstract": "The chromosomal region critical in Down syndrome has long been analyzed through  genotype-phenotype correlation studies using data from many patients with partial  trisomy 21. Owing to that, a relatively small region of human chromosome 21  (35.9\u2009~\u200938.0\u00a0Mb) has been considered as Down syndrome critical region (DSCR). In  this study, microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization analysis identified  complex rearrangements of chromosome 21 in a patient manifesting clinical features  partially overlapped with that of Down syndrome. Although the patient did not show  up-slanting palpebral fissures and single transverse palmar creases, other symptoms  were consistent with Down syndrome. Rearrangements were analyzed by whole-genome  sequencing using Nanopore long-read sequencing. The analysis revealed that  chromosome 21 was fragmented into seven segments and reassembled by six connected  points. Among 12 breakpoints, 5 are located within the short region and overlapped  with repeated segments. The rearrangement resulted in a maximum gain of five copies,  but no region showed loss of genomic copy numbers. Breakpoint-junctions showed no  homologous region. Based on these findings, chromoanasynthesis was considered as the  mechanism. Although the distal 21q22.13 region was not included in the aberrant  regions, some of the genes located on the duplicated regions, SOD1, SON, ITSN1,  RCAN1, and RUNX1, were considered as possible candidate genes for clinical features  of the patient. We discussed the critical region for Down syndrome, with the  literature review.",

        "Title": "An HMG1-like protein facilitates Wnt signaling in Caenorhabditis elegans.",
        "Abstract": "We show that during Caenorhabditis elegans male spicule development, the  specification of a glial versus neuronal cell fate in a canonical neurogenic  sublineage is dependent on Wnt signaling. Inactivation of a Wnt signaling pathway  mediated by the Wnt receptor LIN-17 transforms the SPD sheath cell into its sister,  the SPD neuron. We discovered a new mutant, son-1, that displays this same cell fate  transformation. The son-1 mutation enhances the phenotypes of reduction-of-function  lin-17 mutants in several developmental processes, including vulva development,  somatic gonad development, and male tail patterning. son-1 encodes an HMG1/2-like  DNA-binding protein and is localized in all cell nuclei through development as  revealed by a GFP reporter construct. Disruption of son-1 function by RNA-mediated  interference results in the same spicule defect as caused by overexpression of  POP-1, a TCF/LEF class HMG protein known to act downstream of the Wnt signaling  pathway. Our results provide in vivo evidence for the functional involvement of an  HMG1/2-like protein, SON-1, in Wnt signaling. The sequence nonspecific HMG protein  SON-1 and the sequence specific HMG protein POP-1 might both act in the Wnt  responding cells to regulate gene transcription in opposite directions.",

        "Abstract": "The amino acid sequence of gene products is routinely deduced from the nucleotide  sequence of the relative cloned cDNA, according to the rules for recognition of  start codon (first-AUG rule, optimal sequence context) and the genetic code. From  this prediction stem most subsequent types of product analysis, although all  standard methods for cDNA cloning are affected by a potential inability to  effectively clone the 5' region of mRNA. Revision by bioinformatics and cloning  methods of 109 known genes located on human chromosome 21 (HC 21) shows that 60  mRNAs lack any in-frame stop upstream of the first-AUG, and that in five cases  (DSCR1, KIAA0184, KIAA0539, SON, and TFF3) the coding region at the 5' end was  incompletely characterized in the original descriptions. We describe the respective  consequences for genomic annotation, domain and ortholog identification, and  functional experiments design. We have also analyzed the sequences of 13,124 human  mRNAs (RefSeq databank), discovering that in 6448 cases (49%), an in-frame stop  codon is present upstream of the initiation codon, while in the other 6676 mRNAs  (51%), identification of additional bases at the mRNA 5' region could well reveal  some new upstream in-frame AUG codons in the optimal context. Proportionally to the  HC 21 data, about 550 known human genes might thus be affected by this 5' end mRNA  artifact.",

Specific antibodies (antiserum) were raised to  synthetic peptide, that corresponds to son-protein 943-963 amino acid residues. With  this antiserum the presence of son-protein was showed in lysates of cultured human  cells transformed by adenovirus type 5, RAT 2 cells and primary human embryonic  fibroblasts. son-Protein molecular weight (92 kDa) was determined by the method of  electrophoresis in SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Thus, it was shown the presence of son  gene protein in animal and human cells. To determine a possible son gene role in  mammalian cells we have cloned the 3' part (2667 b.p.) of son cDNA in retroviral  vector pPS-3-neo. Transformed cells of different lines were selected. A large  portion of this cells changed their morphology. New protein product (120 k), that  reacted with antiserum to son specific peptide, was found together with p92son in  these clones.",

        "Title": "Insights into mRNP biogenesis provided by new genetic interactions among export and  transcription factors.",
        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The various steps of mRNP biogenesis (transcription, processing and  export) are interconnected. It has been shown that the transcription machinery plays  a pivotal role in mRNP assembly, since several mRNA export factors are recruited  during transcription and physically interact with components of the transcription  machinery. Although the shuttling DEAD-box protein Dbp5p is concentrated on the  cytoplasmic fibrils of the NPC, previous studies demonstrated that it interacts  physically and genetically with factors involved in transcription initiation.  RESULTS: We investigated the effect of mutations affecting various components of the  transcription initiation apparatus on the phenotypes of mRNA export mutant strains.  Our results show that growth and mRNA export defects of dbp5 and mex67 mutant  strains can be suppressed by mutation of specific transcription initiation  components, but suppression was not observed for mutants acting in the very first  steps of the pre-initiation complex (PIC) formation. CONCLUSIONS: Our results  indicate that mere reduction in the amount of mRNP produced is not sufficient to  suppress the defects caused by a defective mRNA export factor. Suppression occurs  only with mutants affecting events within a narrow window of the mRNP biogenesis  process. We propose that reducing the speed with which transcription converts from  initiation and promoter clearance to elongation may have a positive effect on mRNP  formation by permitting more effective recruitment of partially-functional mRNP  proteins to the nascent mRNP.",

        "Abstract": "The DHH1 gene in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes a putative RNA helicase  of remarkable sequence similarity to several other DExD/H-box proteins, including  Xp54 in Xenopus laevis and Ste13p in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. We show here that  over-expression of Xp54, an integral component of the stored messenger  ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) particles, can rescue the loss of Dhh1p in yeast.  Localization and sedimentation studies showed that Dhh1p exists predominantly in the  cytoplasm and is present in large complexes whose sizes appear to vary according to  the growth stage of the cell culture. In addition, deletion of dhh1, when placed in  conjunction with the mutant dbp5 and ded1 alleles, resulted in a synergistically  lethal effect, suggesting that Dhh1p may have a role in mRNA export and translation.  Finally, similar to Ste13p, Dhh1p is required for sporulation in the budding yeast.  Taken together, our data provide evidence that the functions of Dhh1p are conserved  through evolution.",

        "Abstract": "In a screen for temperature-sensitive mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae defective  for mRNA export, we previously identified the essential DEAD-box protein Dbp5p/Rat8p  and the nucleoporin Rat7p/Nup159p. Both are essential for mRNA export. Here we  report that Dbp5p and Rat7p interact through their Nterminal domains. Deletion of  this portion of Rat7p (Rat7pDeltaN) results in strong defects in mRNA export and  eliminates association of Dbp5p with nuclear pores. Overexpression of Dbp5p  completely suppressed the growth and mRNA export defects of rat7DeltaN cells and  resulted in weaker suppression in cells carrying rat7-1 or the rss1-37 allele of  GLE1. Dbp5p interacts with Gle1p independently of the N-terminus of Dbp5p. Dbp5p  shuttles between nucleus and cytoplasm in an Xpo1p-dependent manner. It accumulates  in nuclei of xpo1-1 cells and in cells with mutations affecting Mex67p (mex67-5),  Gsp1p (Ran) or Ran effectors. Overexpression of Dbp5p prevents nuclear accumulation  of mRNA in xpo1-1 cells, but does not restore growth, suggesting that the RNA export  defect of xpo1-1 cells may be indirect. In a screen for high-copy suppressors of the  rat8-2 allele of DBP5, we identified YMR255w, now called GFD1. Gfd1p is not  essential, interacts with Gle1p and Rip1p/Nup42p, and is found in the cytoplasm and  at the nuclear rim.",

        "Abstract": "Recently we have published a sequence of the coding region of the son gene,  containing at least six areas of the tandem repeats [V.V. Bliskovsky, F.B.  Berdichevsky, A.V. Tkachenko, M.E. Belova, I.M. Chumakov--Molecularnaya biologiya,  1992, V. 26. P. 793-806; V.V. Bliskovsky, A.V. Kirillov, V.M. Zacharyev, I.M.  Chumakov--Molecularnaya biologiya, 1992, V. 26. P. 807-812]. The presence of several  areas of tandem repeats with different nucleotide sequences of the repeated elements  within one and the same gene supports the proposition that genomic localization of  the sequence influences its duplication. Here we present a nucleotide sequence of  the son pseudogene isolated as the result of hybridization screening of a human  genomic library using the sequence of the son gene as a probe. The comparison of the  gene and the pseudogene nucleotide sequences shows that the sequence of pseudogene  does not contain five repeated units of an area of the tandem repeats, which are  presented in the homology sequence of the son gene. Because the pseudogene was  probably generated by the reverse son-gene transcript insertion to the genome, and  so the nucleotide sequences of the coding region of the gene and the sequence of the  pseudogene were identical at this moment, the differences between the gene and the  pseudogene are the results of their evolution after the generation of the  pseudogene. Possible factors, influenced the son gene and the son pseudogene  evolution are discussed.",

This report suggests that the  cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) component of the IL-4 receptor signalling programme in  human tonsillar B cells has a functionally important role in regulating expression  of the CD25 gene by attenuating activity of a protein binding to a potent negative  regulatory element (NRE) in the CD25 promoter; this effect can be mimicked by agents  that elevate cAMP and blocked by inhibitors of PKA but not protein kinase C (PKC).  In a B-cell line that fails to elevate cAMP, attenuate NRE-binding protein (NRE-BP)  activity or express CD25 following IL-4 treatment, stimulation of cAMP accumulation  by forskolin facilitates IL-4-mediated induction of both the endogenous gene and an  exogenous reporter gene under the control of a minimal promoter/enhancer fragment of  the CD25 gene.",

Mutation or deletion of  HDAC4 causes brachydactyly mental retardation syndrome (BDMR), a disorder that  includes intellectual disability, behavioral abnormalities, autism spectrum  disorder, and craniofacial and skeletal anomalies, including brachydactyly type E.  We present a case of familial BDMR, including a parent with mild symptoms of the  disorder and a child exhibiting a more severe phenotype. Cytogenetic testing showed  a cryptic balanced translocation in the mother that resulted in a 2q37.1 monosomy  and a 10q26.1 trisomy in the son. Gene expression analyses demonstrated 67% HDAC4  expression in the mother and 23% HDAC4 expression in the son relative to normal  controls, lending evidence to the hypothesis that HDAC4 modulates severity of this  disorder in a dosage-dependent manner.",

        "Abstract": "It has been postulated that increased dietary sodium associated with greater food  intake by obese people is a mechanism for the relationship between obesity and blood  pressure (BP). We have evaluated this hypothesis by exploring the interrelationships  of measures of obesity, sodium intake, and BP in 248 \"normal\" adolescents, 16 to 17  years of age. As an index of sodium intake, the sodium excretion in three overnight  urine collections was used. As a more specific index of saltiness of diet, we used a  ratio of sodium excretion to calorie intake, with calories estimated from 3-day diet  records and dietary interview. Body weight and other measures of obesity showed a  positive relationship with systolic blood pressure (SBP), but not with diastolic  (K5) blood pressure (DBP5). Measures of overnight sodium excretion were positively  correlated with body weight and calculated body fat percentage, suggesting that  heavier people indeed ingest more sodium. This may result not from increased intake  of food per se, but from increased saltiness of diet, since calorie intake did not  increase with body weight. No significant relationships were found between BP and  concurrent measures of sodium excretion or diet saltiness.",

A protein,  termed MMTV NRE-binding protein 1 (MNBP-1), that recognizes long terminal repeat  sequences between -433 and -418 was identified by gel electrophoresis mobility shift  assays and methylation interference footprinting in nuclear extracts of HeLa and  Ltk(-) cells.

Here we report the structure of  repeats that exist at the long open reading, present in the structure of this  smaller (5.6 kb) transcript of human gene son. We were able to identify in this  transcript four areas of complete tandem repeats, formed by several steps of  duplication. For three of them the extent of homology between amino acid sequences  of repeated elements is higher than between their nucleic acid sequences. It means  that amino acid sequences of repeated elements are conserved, that could reflect the  structural significance for the function of hypothetical protein product of human  gene son. On the basis of the results of analysis we proposed the model for the  formation of repeats by processes of duplication, mutation and natural selection  pressure at the expressed protein level.",
