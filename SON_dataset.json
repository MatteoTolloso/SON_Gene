    "abstract": "With the rapid development of genetic detection technology, especially next-generation sequencing, identification of the aetiology of unexplained intellectual disabilities accompanied by seizures and other dysmorphic features has become possible. The purpose of our paper is to make a definitive diagnosis of a girl with neonatal hypotonia, severe global developmental delay, seizures and mild facial dysmorphism.\nThe clinical data of the patient were retrospectively studied. Whole-exome sequencing was performed on a blood sample from the patient. Subsequently, Sanger sequencing was utilized for validation of variants and parental validation.\nThe patient had hypotonia since the neonatal period. She showed a significant delay in physical and psychomotor development. She did not have any speech until the age of 2\u00a0years and 6\u00a0months. She had seizures that were easy to control with levetiracetam. The craniocerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) then showed mild delayed myelination, enlarged bilateral ventricles and widened frontotemporal extracerebral space. Interictal video electroencephalogram (VEEG) was normal. She had esotropia and mild facial abnormalities with a flat nasal bridge and a short nose. She showed no abnormalities in the heart, genitourinary or skeletal systems. Whole-exome sequencing revealed a novel de novo variant c.5334_5335delAG (p. Arg1778Serfs*11) in the SON gene.\nOur paper reports a novel variant in the SON gene and provides a definitive diagnosis of a female with neonatal hypotonia, severe global developmental delay, seizures and mild facial abnormalities, which are symptoms consistent with Zhu-Tokita-Takenouchi-Kim syndrome (ZTTK syndrome).",

    "abstract": "While dysregulation of RNA splicing has been recognized as an emerging target for cancer therapy, the functional significance of RNA splicing and individual splicing factors in brain tumors is poorly understood. Here, we identify SON as a master regulator that activates PTBP1-mediated oncogenic splicing while suppressing RBFOX2-mediated non-oncogenic neuronal splicing in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). SON is overexpressed in GBM patients and SON knockdown causes failure in intron removal from the PTBP1 transcript, resulting in PTBP1 downregulation and inhibition of its downstream oncogenic splicing. Furthermore, SON forms a complex with hnRNP A2B1 and antagonizes RBFOX2, which leads to skipping of RBFOX2-targeted cassette exons, including the PTBP2 neuronal exon. SON knockdown inhibits proliferation and clonogenicity of GBM cells in vitro and significantly suppresses tumor growth in orthotopic xenografts in vivo. Collectively, our study reveals that SON-mediated RNA splicing is a GBM vulnerability, implicating SON as a potential therapeutic target in brain tumors.",

    "abstract": "Zhu-Tokita-Takenouchi-Kim (ZTTK) syndrome is caused by de novo loss-of-function variants in the SON gene (MIM #617140). This multisystemic disorder is characterized by intellectual disability, seizures, abnormal brain imaging, variable dysmorphic features, and various congenital anomalies. The wide application and increasing accessibility of whole exome sequencing (WES) has helped to identify new cases of ZTTK syndrome over the last few years. To date, there have been approximately 45 cases reported in the literature. Here, we describe 15 additional individuals with variants in the SON gene, including those with missense variants bringing the total number of known cases to 60. We have reviewed the clinical and molecular data of these new cases and all previously reported cases to further delineate the most common as well as emerging clinical findings related to this syndrome. Furthermore, we aim to delineate any genotype-phenotype correlations specifically for a recurring pathogenic four base pair deletion (c.5753_5756del) along with discussing the impact of missense variants seen in the SON gene.",

    "abstract": "Splicing is catalyzed by the spliceosome, a compositionally dynamic complex assembled stepwise on pre-mRNA. We reveal links between splicing machinery components and the intrinsically disordered ciliopathy protein SANS. Pathogenic mutations in SANS/USH1G lead to Usher syndrome-the most common cause of deaf-blindness. Previously, SANS was shown to function only in the cytosol and primary cilia. Here, we have uncovered molecular links between SANS and pre-mRNA splicing catalyzed by the spliceosome in the nucleus. We show that SANS is found in Cajal bodies and nuclear speckles, where it interacts with components of spliceosomal sub-complexes such as SF3B1 and the large splicing cofactor SON but also with PRPFs and snRNAs related to the tri-snRNP complex. SANS is required for the transfer of tri-snRNPs between Cajal bodies and nuclear speckles for spliceosome assembly and may also participate in snRNP recycling back to Cajal bodies. SANS depletion alters the kinetics of spliceosome assembly, leading to accumulation of complex A. SANS deficiency and USH1G pathogenic mutations affects splicing of genes related to cell proliferation and human Usher syndrome. Thus, we provide the first evidence that splicing dysregulation may participate in the pathophysiology of Usher syndrome.",

    "abstract": "Telomere length control is critical for cellular lifespan and tumor suppression. Telomerase is transiently activated in the inner cell mass of the developing blastocyst to reset telomere reserves. Its silencing upon differentiation leads to gradual telomere shortening in somatic cells. Here, we report that transcriptional regulation through cis-regulatory elements only partially accounts for telomerase activation in pluripotent cells. Instead, developmental control of telomerase is primarily driven by an alternative splicing event, centered around hTERT exon 2. Skipping of exon 2 triggers hTERT mRNA decay in differentiated cells, and conversely, its retention promotes telomerase accumulation in pluripotent cells. We identify SON as a regulator of exon 2 alternative splicing and report a patient carrying a SON mutation and suffering from insufficient telomerase and short telomeres. In summary, our study highlights a critical role for hTERT alternative splicing in the developmental regulation of telomerase and implicates defective splicing in telomere biology disorders.",

    "abstract": "The gene SON is on human chromosome 21 (21q22.11) and is thought to be associated with hematopoietic disorders that accompany Down syndrome. Additionally, SON is an RNA splicing factor that plays a role in the transcription of leukemia-associated genes. Previously, we showed that mutations in SON cause malformations in human and zebrafish spines and brains during early embryonic development. To examine the role of SON in normal hematopoiesis, we reduced expression of the zebrafish homolog of SON in zebrafish at the single-cell developmental stage with specific morpholinos. In addition to the brain and spinal malformations we also observed abnormal blood cell levels upon son knockdown. We then investigated how blood production was altered when levels of son were reduced. Decreased levels of son resulted in lower amounts of red blood cells when visualized with lcr:GFP transgenic fish. There were also reduced thrombocytes seen with cd41:GFP fish, and myeloid cells when mpx:GFP fish were examined. We also observed a significant decrease in the quantity of T cells, visualized with lck:GFP fish. However, when we examined their hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), we saw no difference in colony-forming capability. These studies indicate that son is essential for the proper differentiation of the innate and adaptive immune system, and further investigation determining the molecular pathways involved during blood development should elucidate important information about vertebrate HSPC generation, proliferation, and differentiation.",

    "abstract": "Current models of gene expression, which are based on single-molecule localization microscopy, acknowledge protein clustering and the formation of transcriptional condensates as a driving force of gene expression. However, these models largely omit the role of nuclear lipids and amongst them nuclear phosphatidylinositol phosphates (PIPs) in particular. Moreover, the precise distribution of nuclear PIPs in the functional sub-nuclear domains remains elusive. The direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM) provides an unprecedented resolution in biological imaging. Therefore, its use for imaging in the densely crowded cell nucleus is desired but also challenging. Here we present a dual-color dSTORM imaging and image analysis of nuclear PI(4,5)P2, PI(3,4)P2 and PI(4)P distribution while preserving the context of nuclear architecture. In the nucleoplasm, PI(4,5)P2 and PI(3,4)P2 co-pattern in close proximity with the subset of RNA polymerase II foci. PI(4,5)P2 is surrounded by fibrillarin in the nucleoli and all three PIPs are dispersed within the matrix formed by the nuclear speckle protein SON. PI(4,5)P2 is the most abundant nuclear PIP, while PI(4)P is a precursor for the biosynthesis of PI(4,5)P2 and PI(3,4)P2. Therefore, our data are relevant for the understanding the roles of nuclear PIPs and provide further evidence for the model in which nuclear PIPs represent a localization signal for the formation of lipo-ribonucleoprotein hubs in the nucleus. The discussed experimental pipeline is applicable for further functional studies on the role of other nuclear PIPs in the regulation of gene expression and beyond.",

Localization of the protein to various cellular compartments (nucleoplasm, nuclear envelope, and cytoplasm) highlights the ability of Dbp5 to modulate different stages of the RNA lifecycle. While Dbp5 has been well studied for\u2009>\u200920\u00a0years, several critical questions remain regarding the mechanistic principles that govern Dbp5 localization, substrate selection, and functions in gene expression.

    "abstract": "Nuclear speckles (NS) are among the most prominent biomolecular condensates. Despite their prevalence, research on the function of NS is virtually restricted to colocalization analyses, since an organizing core, without which NS cannot form, remains unidentified. The monoclonal antibody SC35, raised against a spliceosomal extract, is frequently used to mark NS. Unexpectedly, we found that this antibody was mischaracterized and the main target of SC35 mAb is SRRM2, a spliceosome-associated protein that sharply localizes to NS. Here we show that, the core of NS is likely formed by SON and SRRM2, since depletion of SON leads only to a partial disassembly of NS, while co-depletion of SON and SRRM2 or depletion of SON in a cell-line where intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) of SRRM2 are genetically deleted, leads to a near-complete dissolution of NS. This work, therefore, paves the way to study the role of NS under diverse physiological and stress conditions.\nMost cells store their genetic material inside a compartment called the nucleus, which helps to separate DNA from other molecules in the cell. Inside the nucleus, DNA is tightly packed together with proteins that can read the cell\u2019s genetic code and convert into the RNA molecules needed to build proteins. However, the contents of the nucleus are not randomly arranged, and these proteins are often clustered into specialized areas where they perform their designated roles. One of the first nuclear territories to be identified were granular looking structures named Nuclear Speckles (or NS for short), which are thought to help process RNA before it leaves the nucleus. Structures like NS often contain a number of different factors held together by a core group of proteins known as a scaffold. Although NS were discovered over a century ago, little is known about their scaffold proteins, making it difficult to understand the precise role of these speckles. Typically, researchers visualize NS using a substance called SC35 which targets specific sites in these structures. However, it was unclear which parts of the NS this marker binds to. To answer this question, Ilik et al. studied NS in human cells grown in the lab. The analysis revealed that SC35 attaches to certain parts of a large, flexible protein called SRRM2. Ilik et al. discovered that although the structure and sequence of SRMM2 varies between different animal species, a small region of this protein remained unchanged throughout evolution. Studying the evolutionary history of SRRM2 led to the identification of another protein with similar properties called SON. Ilik et al. found that depleting SON and SRRM2 from human cells caused other proteins associated with the NS to diffuse away from their territories and become dispersed within the nucleus. This suggests that SRMM2 and SON make up the scaffold that holds the proteins in NS together. Nuclear speckles have been associated with certain viral infections, and seem to help prevent the onset of diseases such as Huntington\u2019s and spinocerebellar ataxia. These newly discovered core proteins could therefore further our understanding of the role NS play in disease.",

    "abstract": "In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the mRNA export receptor Mex67 is recruited to mature nuclear transcripts to mediate mRNA export through the nuclear pore complex (NPC) to the cytoplasm. Mex67 binds transcripts through adaptor proteins such as the poly(A) binding protein Nab2. When a transcript reaches the cytoplasmic face of the NPC, the DEAD-box protein Dbp5 acts to induce a local structural change to release Nab2 and Mex67 in an essential process termed mRNP remodeling. It is unknown how certain proteins (Nab2, Mex67) are released during Dbp5-mediated mRNP remodeling, whereas others remain associated. Here, we demonstrate that Dbp5 associates in close proximity with Mex67 and Nab2 in a cellular complex. Further, fusion of Dbp5 to Nup159 anchors Dbp5 at the cytoplasmic face of the NPC and is sufficient for cell viability. Thus, we speculate that the essential role of Dbp5 in remodeling exporting mRNPs requires its localization to the NPC and is separable from other subcellular functions of Dbp5. This work supports a model where the diverse nuclear, cytoplasmic and NPC functions of Dbp5 in the mRNA lifecycle are not interdependent and that Dbp5 is locally recruited through complex protein-protein interactions to select regions of transcripts for specific removal of transport proteins at the NPC.",

There are only 33 cases and 26 causative SON variants reported to date since the first report in 2015. Here, we report a new case of ZTTK syndrome and a de novo disease-causing SON variant.\nWe conducted whole-exome sequencing (WES) to obtain genetic data of the patient. The clinical and genetic data of the patient were analyzed.\nThe clinical features of our patient were strikingly similar to previously reported cases. Notably, our patient had unique presentations, including a bridged palmar crease in the left hand and growth hormone deficiency. The c.5297del de novo variant in SON causes an amino change (p.Ser1766Leufs*7).\nOur report expands the mutant spectrum of the SON gene and refines the genotype-phenotype map of ZTTK syndrome. Our findings also highlighted the importance of WES for early diagnosis of ZTTK syndrome, which may improve diagnostic procedures for affected individuals.",

    "abstract": "The genetic etiology of intellectual and psychomotor disability without a defined spectrum of dysmorphic features is usually monogenic. As no diagnostic criteria for such diseases are established, the clinical diagnosis becomes to be a challenge. The object of our paper is to present two patients with non-specific clinical symptoms for whom whole-exome-sequencing identified the new SON mutations and thus allowed for establishing the diagnosis of Zhu-Tokita-Takenouchi-Kim (ZTTK) syndrome. In both patients, the same symptoms including hypotonia, developmental and speech delay, feeding difficulties as well as frequent infections of the respiratory tract and internal ear were observed. However, both cases presented also with exceptional symptoms such as in case 1 ventriculomegaly and asymmetry of ventricles, hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS), intellectual disability, intestinal malrotation, gastroparesis, and duodenal atresia and in the case 2 febrile seizures and reduced IgA levels. We will be presenting the patients and comparing them to 30 previously described cases.\nWhole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed on the probands' DNA and paired-end sequenced (2x100\u00a0bp) on HiSeq 1500. Variants considered as disease-causing were validated in the proband and studied in all available family members by amplicon deep sequencing performed using Nextera XT Kit and sequenced on HiSeq 1500.\nWe have identified two new variants in SON gene. In case 1 it has been a heterozygous frameshift variant p.(Ala1340GlnfsTer26), while in case 2 it has been a heterozygous frameshift variant, p.(Asp1640GlyfsTer7). Both variants are described for the first time and up to now, are not mentioned in any database.\nAs there are no precise criteria established for the clinical diagnosis of ZTTK, an identification of SON gene mutation by whole-exome-sequencing is the best method that allows for a diagnosis of this syndrome.",

    "abstract": "The chromosomal region critical in Down syndrome has long been analyzed through genotype-phenotype correlation studies using data from many patients with partial trisomy 21. Owing to that, a relatively small region of human chromosome 21 (35.9\u2009~\u200938.0\u00a0Mb) has been considered as Down syndrome critical region (DSCR). In this study, microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization analysis identified complex rearrangements of chromosome 21 in a patient manifesting clinical features partially overlapped with that of Down syndrome. Although the patient did not show up-slanting palpebral fissures and single transverse palmar creases, other symptoms were consistent with Down syndrome. Rearrangements were analyzed by whole-genome sequencing using Nanopore long-read sequencing. The analysis revealed that chromosome 21 was fragmented into seven segments and reassembled by six connected points. Among 12 breakpoints, 5 are located within the short region and overlapped with repeated segments. The rearrangement resulted in a maximum gain of five copies, but no region showed loss of genomic copy numbers. Breakpoint-junctions showed no homologous region. Based on these findings, chromoanasynthesis was considered as the mechanism. Although the distal 21q22.13 region was not included in the aberrant regions, some of the genes located on the duplicated regions, SOD1, SON, ITSN1, RCAN1, and RUNX1, were considered as possible candidate genes for clinical features of the patient. We discussed the critical region for Down syndrome, with the literature review.",

    "abstract": "Intracellular pathogens affect diverse host cellular defence and metabolic pathways. Here, we used infection with Francisella\u00a0tularensis to identify SON DNA-binding protein as a central determinant of macrophage activities. RNAi knockdown of SON increases survival of human macrophages following F.\u00a0tularensis infection or inflammasome stimulation. SON is required for macrophage autophagy, interferon response factor 3 expression, type I interferon response and inflammasome-associated readouts. SON knockdown has gene- and stimulus-specific effects on inflammatory gene expression. SON is required for accurate splicing and expression of GBF1, a key mediator of cis-Golgi structure and function. Chemical GBF1 inhibition has similar effects to SON knockdown, suggesting that SON controls macrophage functions at least in part by controlling Golgi-associated processes.",

    "abstract": "Zhu-Tokita-Takenouchi-Kim (ZTTK) syndrome, a rare congenital anomaly syndrome characterized by intellectual disability, brain malformation, facial dysmorphism, musculoskeletal abnormalities, and some visceral malformations is caused by de novo heterozygous mutations of the SON gene. The nuclear protein SON is involved in gene transcription and RNA splicing; however, the roles of SON in neural development remain undetermined. We investigated the effects of Son knockdown on neural development in mice and found that Son knockdown in neural progenitors resulted in defective migration during corticogenesis and reduced spine density on mature cortical neurons. The induction of human wild-type SON expression rescued these neural abnormalities, confirming that the abnormalities were caused by SON insufficiency. We also applied truncated SON proteins encoded by disease-associated mutant SON genes for rescue experiments and found that a truncated SON protein encoded by the most prevalent SON mutant found in ZTTK syndrome rescued the neural abnormalities while another much shorter mutant SON protein did not. These data indicate that SON insufficiency causes neuronal migration defects and dendritic spine abnormalities, which seem neuropathological bases of the neural symptoms of ZTTK syndrome. In addition, the results support that the neural abnormalities in ZTTK syndrome are caused by SON haploinsufficiency independent of the types of mutation that results in functional or dysfunctional proteins.",

    "abstract": "Zhu-Tokita-Takenouchi-Kim syndrome is a severe multisystem developmental disorder characterized by intellectual disability, developmental delay, malformations of the cerebral cortex, epilepsy, vision problems, musculoskeletal abnormalities, and congenital malformations. This syndrome is caused by heterozygous pathogenic variants in the SON gene at chromosome 21q22.1.\nThe aim of this study was to investigate the pathogenesis of a 4-year-old Chinese child who displayed severe intellectual disability, delayed psychomotor development, and facial dysmorphism.\nA sequential detection including chromosome karyotyping, chromosome microarray analysis (CMA), and whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed on this child. The familial verification of WES result was conducted by Sanger sequencing.\nA de novo frameshift variant SON: c.5230delC (p.Arg1744ValfsTer29) was identified in the proband. The identical variant was not found in his family members. The frequencies of this variant in gnomAD/gnomAD_EAS databases were both none.\nThis study substantiates that SON: c.5230delC (p.Arg1744ValfsTer29) is a pathogenic variant of Zhu-Tokita-Takenouchi-Kim syndrome and it is the first time to report Zhu-Tokita-Takenouchi-Kim syndrome in China.",

Using a detectable transcriptionally active gene in living cells, we previously found that an mRNA undergoing several splicing events was retained at this gene after transcription until completion of mRNA processing. To determine the reason for this delay in release and whether mRNA retention on the gene might depend on splicing factor availability, we modulated the levels of splicing factors in the nucleus. Increasing the abundance of the diffusing fraction of splicing factors by their overexpression or by Clk1 kinase overexpression to disassemble nuclear speckles, led to a reduction in splicing factor residence times on the active gene, and the retained mRNA was rapidly released from the gene. Other treatments such as overexpression of a mutant inactive Clk1, the downregulation of MALAT1 lncRNA or of the Son protein, or the overexpression of the splicing factor import factor TNPO3, did not affect the dynamics of mRNA release from the gene. We found that the faster release of the mRNA from the gene mediated by increased availability of splicing factors, was dependent on the RS domain of the splicing factors and its phosphorylation state. We propose that the relative abundancies of splicing factors in the nucleoplasm can affect their availability for the splicing events taking place, and regulate the kinetics of mRNA release from the gene after processing.",

    "abstract": "The RNA export factor Mex67 is essential for the transport of mRNA through the nuclear pore complex (NPC) in yeast, but the molecular mechanism of this export process remains poorly understood. Here, we use quantitative fluorescence microscopy techniques in live budding yeast cells to investigate how Mex67 facilitates mRNA export. We show that Mex67 exhibits little interaction with mRNA in the nucleus and localizes to the NPC independently of mRNA, occupying a set of binding sites offered by FG repeats in the NPC. The ATPase Dbp5, which is thought to remove Mex67 from transcripts, does not affect the interaction of Mex67 with the NPC. Strikingly, we find that the essential function of Mex67 is spatially restricted to the NPC since a fusion of Mex67 to the nucleoporin Nup116 rescues a deletion of ",

    "abstract": "Export of mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm is a critical process for all eukaryotic gene expression. As mRNA is synthesized, it is packaged with a myriad of RNA-binding proteins to form ribonucleoprotein particles (mRNPs). For each step in the processes of maturation and export, mRNPs must have the correct complement of proteins. Much of the mRNA export pathway revolves around the heterodimeric export receptor yeast Mex67\u2022Mtr2/human NXF1\u2022NXT1, which is recruited to signal the completion of nuclear mRNP assembly, mediates mRNP targeting/translocation through the nuclear pore complex (NPC), and is displaced at the cytoplasmic side of the NPC to release the mRNP into the cytoplasm. Directionality of the transport is governed by at least two DEAD-box ATPases, yeast Sub2/human UAP56 in the nucleus and yeast Dbp5/human DDX19 at the cytoplasmic side of the NPC, which respectively mediate the association and dissociation of Mex67\u2022Mtr2/NXF1\u2022NXT1 onto the mRNP. Here we review recent progress from structural studies of key constituents in different steps of nuclear mRNA export. These findings have laid the foundation for further studies to obtain a comprehensive mechanistic view of the mRNA export pathway.",

    "abstract": "Translocation of mRNA through the nuclear pore complex (NPC) requires interactions with different NPC regions. To determine the interactions that are crucial for effective mRNA export in living cells, we examined mRNA export within individual pores by applying various types of mRNA export blocks that stalled mRNPs at different stages of transition. Focusing on the major mRNA export factor NXF1, we found that initial mRNP binding to the NPC did not require NXF1 in the NPC, whereas release into the cytoplasm did. NXF1 localization in the NPC did not require RNA or RNA binding. Superresolution microscopy showed that NXF1 consistently occupied positions on the cytoplasmic side of the NPC. Interactions with specific nucleoporins were pinpointed using FLIM-FRET for measuring protein-protein interactions inside single NPCs, showing that Dbp5 helicase activity of mRNA release is conserved in yeast and humans. Altogether, we find that specific interactions on the cytoplasmic side of the NPC are fundamental for the directional flow of mRNA export.",

    "abstract": "Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) depend on glycolysis for energy and substrates for biosynthesis. To understand the mechanisms governing the metabolism of hESCs, we investigated the transcriptional regulation of glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1, SLC2A1), a key glycolytic gene to maintain pluripotency. By combining the genome-wide data of binding sites of the core pluripotency factors (SOX2, OCT4, NANOG, denoted SON), chromosomal interaction and histone modification in hESCs, we identified a potential enhancer of the GLUT1 gene in hESCs, denoted GLUT1 enhancer (GE) element. GE interacts with the promoter of GLUT1, and the deletion of GE significantly reduces the expression of GLUT1, glucose uptake and glycolysis of hESCs, confirming that GE is an enhancer of GLUT1 in hESCs. In addition, the mutation of SON binding motifs within GE reduced the expression of GLUT1 as well as the interaction between GE and GLUT1 promoter, indicating that the binding of SON to GE is important for its activity. Therefore, SON promotes glucose uptake and glycolysis in hESCs by inducing GLUT1 expression through directly activating the enhancer of GLUT1.",

    "abstract": "Although genetic testing is increasingly used in clinical nephrology, a large number of patients with congenital abnormalities of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) remain undiagnosed with current gene panels. Therefore, careful curation of novel genetic findings is key to improving diagnostic yields. We recently described a novel intellectual disability syndrome caused by de novo heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding the splicing factor SON. Here, we show that many of these patients, including two previously unreported, exhibit a wide array of kidney abnormalities. Detailed phenotyping of 14 patients with SON haploinsufficiency identified kidney anomalies in 8 patients, including horseshoe kidney, unilateral renal hypoplasia, and renal cysts. Recurrent urinary tract infections, electrolyte disturbances, and hypertension were also observed in some patients. SON knockdown in kidney cell lines leads to abnormal pre-mRNA splicing, resulting in decreased expression of several established CAKUT genes. Furthermore, these molecular events were observed in patient-derived cells with SON haploinsufficiency. Taken together, our data suggest that the wide spectrum of phenotypes in patients with a pathogenic SON mutation is a consequence of impaired pre-mRNA splicing of several CAKUT genes. We propose that genetic testing panels designed to diagnose children with a kidney phenotype should include the SON gene.",

    "abstract": "Translation termination requires eRF1 and eRF3 for polypeptide- and tRNA-release on stop codons. Additionally, Dbp5/DDX19 and Rli1/ABCE1 are required; however, their function in this process is currently unknown. Using a combination of in vivo and in vitro experiments, we show that they regulate a stepwise assembly of the termination complex. Rli1 and eRF3-GDP associate with the ribosome first. Subsequently, Dbp5-ATP delivers eRF1 to the stop codon and in this way prevents a premature access of eRF3. Dbp5 dissociates upon placing eRF1 through ATP-hydrolysis. This in turn enables eRF1 to contact eRF3, as the binding of Dbp5 and eRF3 to eRF1 is mutually exclusive. Defects in the Dbp5-guided eRF1 delivery lead to premature contact and premature dissociation of eRF1 and eRF3 from the ribosome and to subsequent stop codon readthrough. Thus, the stepwise Dbp5-controlled termination complex assembly is essential for regular translation termination events. Our data furthermore suggest a possible role of Dbp5/DDX19 in alternative translation termination events, such as during stress response or in developmental processes, which classifies the helicase as a potential drug target for nonsense suppression therapy to treat cancer and neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "Although the formation of RNA-protein bodies has been studied intensively, their mobility and how their number and size are regulated are still poorly understood. Here, we show significantly increased mobility of nuclear speckles after transcriptional inhibition, including long-range directed motion of one speckle towards another speckle, terminated by speckle fusion, over distances up to 4\u2005\u00b5m and with velocities between 0.2\u2005\u00b5m/min and 1.5\u2005\u00b5m/min. Frequently, three or even four speckles follow very similar paths, with new speckles appearing along the path followed by a preceding speckle. Speckle movements and fusion events contribute to fewer, but larger, speckles after transcriptional inhibition. These speckle movements are not actin dependent, but occur within chromatin-depleted channels enriched with small granules containing the speckle marker protein SON. Similar long-range speckle movements and fusion events were observed after heat shock or heavy metal stress, and during late G2 and early prophase. Our observations suggest a mechanism for long-range, directional nuclear speckle movements, contributing to overall regulation of nuclear speckle number and size as well as overall nuclear organization. This article has an associated First Person interview with the first author of the paper.",

    "abstract": "Medulloblastoma is the most frequent malignant brain tumor in childhood. This highly malignant neoplasm occurs usually before 10\u00a0years of age and more frequently in boys. The 5-year event-free survival rate for high-risk medulloblastoma is low at 62% despite a multimodal therapy including surgical resection, radiation therapy and chemotherapy. We report the case of a boy, who was born to consanguineous parents. Prominently, he had multiple caf\u00e9-au-lait spots. At the age of 3\u00a0years he was diagnosed with a high-risk metastatic medulloblastoma. The patient died only 11\u00a0months after diagnosis of a fulminant relapse presenting as meningeal and spinal dissemination. Whole-exome sequencing of germline DNA was employed to detect the underlying mutation for this putative cancer syndrome presenting with the combination of medulloblastoma and skin alterations. After screening all possible homozygous gene SNVs, we identified a mutation of SON, an essential protein in cell cycle regulation and cell proliferation, as the most likely genetic cause.",

    "abstract": "DBP5, also known as DDX19, GLE1 and inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) function in messenger RNA (mRNA) export at the cytoplasmic surface of the nuclear pore complex in eukaryotic cells. DBP5 is a DEAD-box RNA helicase, and its activity is stimulated by interactions with GLE1 and IP6. In addition, these three factors also have unique role(s). To investigate how these factors influenced the cytoplasmic mRNA expression and cell phenotype change, we performed RNA microarray analysis to detect the effect and function of DBP5, GLE1 and IP6 on the cytoplasmic mRNA expression. The expression of some cytoplasmic mRNA subsets (e.g. cell cycle, DNA replication) was commonly suppressed by the knock-down of DBP5, GLE1 and IPPK (IP6 synthetic enzyme). The GLE1 knock-down selectively reduced the cytoplasmic mRNA expression required for mitotic progression, results in an abnormal spindle phenotype and caused the delay of mitotic process. Meanwhile, G1/S cell cycle arrest was observed in DBP5 and IPPK knock-down cells. Several factors that function in immune response were also down-regulated in DBP5 or IPPK knock-down cells. Thereby, IFN\u03b2-1 mRNA transcription evoked by poly(I:C) treatment was suppressed. These results imply that DBP5, GLE1 and IP6 have a conserved and individual function in the cytoplasmic mRNA expression. Variations in phenotype are due to the difference in each function of DBP5, GLE1 and IPPK in intracellular mRNA metabolism.",

    "abstract": "Nuclear speckles are self-assembled organelles composed of RNAs and proteins. They are proposed to act as structural domains that control distinct steps in gene expression, including transcription, splicing and mRNA export. Earlier studies identified differential localization of a few components within the speckles. It was speculated that the spatial organization of speckle components might contribute directly to the order of operations that coordinate distinct processes. Here, by performing multi-color structured illumination microscopy, we characterized the multilayer organization of speckles at a higher resolution. We found that SON and SC35 (also known as SRSF2) localize to the central region of the speckle, whereas ",

These data indicate that cargo molecule import into the nucleus takes less than 10ms and nuclear export of messenger RNA (mRNA) particles takes 50-350ms, up to several seconds for extremely bulky particles. This review summarizes and discusses experimental results on transport of nuclear transport factor 2 (NTF2), importin \u03b2 and mRNA particles. Putative regulatory functions of importin \u03b2 for the NPC transport mechanism and the RNA helicase Dbp5 for mRNA export kinetics are discussed.",

    "abstract": "The human DEAD-box RNA-helicase DDX19 functions in mRNA export through the nuclear pore complex. The yeast homolog of this protein, Dbp5, has been reported to participate in translation termination. Using a reconstituted mammalian in vitro translation system, we show that the human protein DDX19 is also important for translation termination. It is associated with the fraction of translating ribosomes. We show that DDX19 interacts with pre-termination complexes (preTCs) in a nucleotide-dependent manner. Furthermore, DDX19 increases the efficiency of termination complex (TC) formation and the peptide release in the presence of eukaryotic release factors. Using the eRF1(AGQ) mutant protein or a non-hydrolysable analog of GTP to inhibit subsequent peptidyl-tRNA hydrolysis, we reveal that the activation of translation termination by DDX19 occurs during the stop codon recognition. This activation is a result of DDX19 binding to preTC and a concomitant stabilization of terminating ribosomes. Moreover, we show that DDX19 stabilizes ribosome complexes with translation elongation factors eEF1 and eEF2. Taken together, our findings reveal that the human RNA helicase DDX19 actively participates in protein biosynthesis.",

    "abstract": "Germline stem cells (GSCs) are attractive biological models because of their strict control on pluripotency gene expression, and their potential for huge epigenetic changes in a short period of time. Few data exists on the cooperative impact of GSC-specific genes on differentiated cells. In this study, we over-expressed 3 GSC-specific markers, STELLA, OCT4 and NANOS2, collectively designated as (SON), using the novel polycistronic lentiviral gene construct FUM-FD, in HEK293T cells and evaluated promoter activity of the Stra8 GSC marker gene We could show that HEK293T cells expressed pluripotency and GSC markers following ectopic expression of the SON genes. We also found induction of pluripotency markers after serum starvation in non-transduced HEK293T cells. Expression profiling of SON-expressing and serum-starved cells at mRNA and protein level showed the potential of SON factors and serum starvation in the induction of ESRRB, NANOG, OCT4 and REX1 expression. Additionally, the data indicated that the mouse Stra8 promoter could only be activated in a subpopulation of HEK293T cells, regardless of SON gene expression. We conclude that heterogeneous population of the HEK293T cells might be easily shifted towards expression of the pluripotency markers by ectopic expression of the SON factors or by growth in serum depleted media.",

    "abstract": "The overall understanding of the molecular etiologies of intellectual disability (ID) and developmental delay (DD) is increasing as next-generation sequencing technologies identify genetic variants in individuals with such disorders. However, detailed analyses conclusively confirming these variants, as well as the underlying molecular mechanisms explaining the diseases, are often lacking. Here, we report on an ID syndrome caused by de novo heterozygous loss-of-function (LoF) mutations in SON. The syndrome is characterized by ID and/or DD, malformations of the cerebral cortex, epilepsy, vision problems, musculoskeletal abnormalities, and congenital malformations. Knockdown of son in zebrafish resulted in severe malformation of the spine, brain, and eyes. Importantly, analyses of RNA from affected individuals revealed that genes critical for neuronal migration and cortex organization (TUBG1, FLNA, PNKP, WDR62, PSMD3, and\u00a0HDAC6) and metabolism (PCK2, PFKL, IDH2, ACY1, and ADA) are significantly downregulated because of the accumulation of mis-spliced transcripts resulting from erroneous SON-mediated RNA splicing. Our data highlight SON as a master regulator governing neurodevelopment and demonstrate the importance of SON-mediated RNA splicing in human development.",

    "abstract": "SON is a key component of the spliceosomal complex and a critical mediator of constitutive and alternative splicing. Additionally, SON has been shown to influence cell-cycle progression, genomic integrity, and maintenance of pluripotency in stem cell populations. The clear functional relevance of SON in coordinating essential cellular processes and its presence in diverse human tissues suggests that intact SON might be crucial for normal growth and development. However, the phenotypic effects of deleterious germline variants in SON have not been clearly defined. Herein, we describe seven unrelated individuals with de novo variants in SON and propose that deleterious variants in SON are associated with a severe multisystem disorder characterized by developmental delay, persistent feeding difficulties, and congenital malformations, including brain anomalies.",

    "abstract": "A recent study of exome analyses in 109 patients with undiagnosed diseases included a 5-year-old girl with intellectual disability and multiple congenital anomalies, who had an apparently de novo frameshift mutation in SON. However, the combination of the truncating mutation in SON and the phenotype has not been reproduced until date, and it remains unclear if this combination represents a distinctive disease entity. Here we report an additional male with intellectual disability, congenital heart disease, distinctive facial features with curly hair and protruding ears, and long slender extremities, and hyperextensible joints. Exome analysis showed that he had the same de novo frameshift mutation in SON in a heterozygous state. Along with the first and original description of the apparently de novo truncating mutation in SON mentioned above, we have established that haploinsufficiency of SON causes a new recognizable syndrome of intellectual disability. SON is located within 21q22.11, a critical region for Braddock-Carey syndrome, which is characterized by congenital thrombocytopenia, intellectual disability, micrognathia, and a distinctive facies. Therefore, we suggest that the intellectual disability observed in Braddock-Carey syndrome could be accounted for by haploinsufficiency of SON. \u00a9 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Dysregulation of MLL complex-mediated histone methylation plays a pivotal role in gene expression associated with diseases, but little is known about cellular factors modulating MLL complex activity. Here, we report that SON, previously known as an RNA splicing factor, controls MLL complex-mediated transcriptional initiation. SON binds to DNA near transcription start sites, interacts with menin, and inhibits MLL complex assembly, resulting in decreased H3K4me3 and transcriptional repression. Importantly, alternatively spliced short isoforms of SON are markedly upregulated in acute myeloid leukemia. The short isoforms compete with full-length SON for chromatin occupancy but lack the menin-binding ability, thereby antagonizing full-length SON function in transcriptional repression while not impairing full-length SON-mediated RNA splicing. Furthermore, overexpression of a short isoform of SON enhances replating potential of hematopoietic progenitors. Our findings define SON as a fine-tuner of the MLL-menin interaction and reveal short SON overexpression as a marker indicating aberrant transcriptional initiation in leukemia. ",

    "abstract": "The DEAD-box RNA-helicase Dbp5/Rat8 is known for its function in nuclear mRNA export, where it displaces the export receptor Mex67 from the mRNA at the cytoplasmic side of the nuclear pore complex (NPC). Here we show that Dbp5 is also required for the nuclear export of both pre-ribosomal subunits. Yeast temperature-sensitive dbp5 mutants accumulate both ribosomal particles in their nuclei. Furthermore, Dbp5 genetically and physically interacts with known ribosomal transport factors such as Nmd3. Similar to mRNA export we show that also for ribosomal transport Dbp5 is required at the cytoplasmic side of the NPC. However, unlike its role in mRNA export, Dbp5 does not seem to undergo its ATPase cycle for this function, as ATPase-deficient dbp5 mutants that selectively inhibit mRNA export do not affect ribosomal transport. Furthermore, mutants of GLE1, the ATPase stimulating factor of Dbp5, show no major ribosomal export defects. Consequently, while Dbp5 uses its ATPase cycle to displace the export receptor Mex67 from the translocated mRNAs, Mex67 remains bound to ribosomal subunits upon transit to the cytoplasm, where it is detectable on translating ribosomes. Therefore, we propose a model, in which Dbp5 supports ribosomal transport by capturing ribosomal subunits upon their cytoplasmic appearance at the NPC, possibly by binding export factors such as Mex67. Thus, our findings reveal that although different ribonucleoparticles, mRNAs and pre-ribosomal subunits, use shared export factors, they utilize different transport mechanisms. ",

    "abstract": "mRNA export from the nucleus depends on the ATPase activity of the DEAD-box protein Dbp5/DDX19. Although Dbp5 has measurable ATPase activity alone, several regulatory factors (e.g., RNA, nucleoporin proteins, and the endogenous small molecule InsP6) modulate catalytic activity in vitro and in vivo to facilitate mRNA export. An analysis of the intrinsic and regulator-activated Dbp5 ATPase cycle is necessary to define how these factors control Dbp5 and mRNA export. Here, we report a kinetic and equilibrium analysis of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Dbp5 ATPase cycle, including the influence of RNA on Dbp5 activity. These data show that ATP binds Dbp5 weakly in rapid equilibrium with a binding affinity (KT~4 mM) comparable to the KM for steady-state cycling, while ADP binds an order of magnitude more tightly (KD~0.4 mM). The overall intrinsic steady-state cycling rate constant (kcat) is limited by slow, near-irreversible ATP hydrolysis and even slower subsequent phosphate release. RNA increases kcat and rate-limiting Pi release 20-fold, although Pi release continues to limit steady-state cycling in the presence of RNA, in conjunction with RNA binding. Together, this work identifies RNA binding and Pi release as important biochemical transitions within the Dbp5 ATPase cycle and provides a framework for investigating the means by which Dbp5 and mRNA export is modulated by regulatory factors.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have reproducibly associated \u223c40 susceptibility loci with psoriasis. However, the missing heritability is evident and the contributions of coding variants have not yet been systematically evaluated. Here, we present a large-scale whole-exome array analysis for psoriasis consisting of 42,760 individuals. We discover 16 SNPs within 15 new genes/loci associated with psoriasis, including C1orf141, ZNF683, TMC6, AIM2, IL1RL1, CASR, SON, ZFYVE16, MTHFR, CCDC129, ZNF143, AP5B1, SYNE2, IFNGR2 and 3q26.2-q27 (P<5.00 \u00d7 10(-08)). In addition, we also replicate four known susceptibility loci TNIP1, NFKBIA, IL12B and LCE3D-LCE3E. These susceptibility variants identified in the current study collectively account for 1.9% of the psoriasis heritability. The variant within AIM2 is predicted to impact protein structure. Our findings increase the number of genetic risk factors for psoriasis and highlight new and plausible biological pathways in psoriasis.",

    "abstract": "Pre-mRNA splicing requires proper splice site selection mediated by many factors including snRNPs and serine-arginine rich (SR) splicing factors. Our lab previously reported that the SR-like protein SON maintains organization of pre-mRNA splicing factors in nuclear speckles as well as splicing of many human transcripts including mRNAs coding for the chromatin-modifying enzymes HDAC6, ADA and SETD8. However, the mechanism by which SON maintains accurate splicing is unknown. To build tools for understanding SON-dependent pre-mRNA splicing, we constructed a minigene reporter plasmid driving expression of the genomic sequence spanning exons 26 through 29 of HDAC6. Following SON depletion, we observed altered splicing of HDAC6 reporter transcripts that showed exclusion of exons 27 and 28, reflecting the splicing patterns of endogenous HDAC6 mRNA. Importantly, loss of HDAC6 biological function was also observed, as indicated by truncated HDAC6 protein and corresponding absence of aggresome assembly activities of HDAC6 binding-of-ubiquitin zinc finger (BUZ) domain. We therefore propose that SON-mediated splicing regulation of HDAC6 is essential for supporting protein degradation pathways that prevent human disease. ",

    "abstract": "Myo-inositol-1,2,3,4,5,6-hexakisphosphate (InsP(6)), also known as phytic acid, accumulates in large quantities in plant seeds, serving as a phosphorus reservoir, but is an animal antinutrient and an important source of water pollution. Here, we report that Gle1 (GLFG lethal 1) in conjunction with InsP(6) functions as an activator of the ATPase/RNA helicase LOS4 (low expression of osmotically responsive genes 4), which is involved in mRNA export in plants, supporting the Gle1-InsP(6)-Dbp5 (LOS4 homolog) paradigm proposed in yeast. Interestingly, plant Gle1 proteins have modifications in several key residues of the InsP(6) binding pocket, which reduce the basicity of the surface charge. Arabidopsis thaliana Gle1 variants containing mutations that increase the basic charge of the InsP(6) binding surface show increased sensitivity to InsP(6) concentrations for the stimulation of LOS4 ATPase activity in vitro. Expression of the Gle1 variants with enhanced InsP(6) sensitivity rescues the mRNA export defect of the ipk1 (inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate 2-kinase) InsP(6)-deficient mutant and, furthermore, significantly improves vegetative growth, seed yield, and seed performance of the mutant. These results suggest that Gle1 is an important factor responsible for mediating InsP(6) functions in plant growth and reproduction and that Gle1 variants with increased InsP(6) sensitivity may be useful for engineering high-yielding low-phytate crops.",

    "abstract": "Controlled transport of macromolecules between the cytoplasm and nucleus is essential for homeostatic regulation of cellular functions. For instance, gene expression entails coordinated nuclear import of transcriptional regulators to activate transcription and nuclear export of the resulting messenger RNAs for cytoplasmic translation. Here we link these two processes by reporting a novel role for the mRNA export factor Ddx19/Dbp5 in nuclear import of MKL1, the signal-responsive transcriptional activator of SRF. We show that Ddx19 is not a general nuclear import factor, and that its specific effect on MKL1 nuclear import is separate from its role in mRNA export. Both helicase and nuclear pore-binding activities of Ddx19 are dispensable for MKL1 nuclear import, but RNA binding is required. Mechanistically, Ddx19 operates by modulating the conformation of MKL1, which affects its interaction with Importin-\u03b2 for efficient nuclear import. Thus, Ddx19 participates in mRNA export, translation and nuclear import of a key transcriptional regulator.",

    "abstract": "Telomerases protect the ends of linear chromosomes from shortening. They are composed of an RNA (TLC1 in S. cerevisiae) and several proteins. TLC1 undergoes several maturation steps before it is exported into the cytoplasm to recruit the Est proteins for complete assembly. The mature telomerase is subsequently reimported into the nucleus, where it fulfills its function on telomeres. Here, we show that TLC1 export into the cytoplasm requires not only the Ran GTPase-dependent karyopherin Crm1/Xpo1 but also the mRNA export machinery. mRNA export factor mutants accumulate mature and export-competent TLC1 RNAs in their nuclei. Moreover, TLC1 physically interacts with the mRNA transport factors Mex67 and Dbp5/Rat8. Most importantly, we show that the nuclear export of TLC1 is an essential step for the formation of the functional RNA containing enzyme, because blocking TLC1 export in the mex67-5 xpo1-1 double mutant prevents its cytoplasmic maturation and leads to telomere shortening.",

    "abstract": "Directional export of messenger RNA (mRNA) protein particles (mRNPs) through nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) requires multiple factors. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the NPC proteins Nup159 and Nup42 are asymmetrically localized to the cytoplasmic face and have distinct functional domains: a phenylalanine-glycine (FG) repeat domain that docks mRNP transport receptors and domains that bind the DEAD-box ATPase Dbp5 and its activating cofactor Gle1, respectively. We speculated that the Nup42 and Nup159 FG domains play a role in positioning mRNPs for the terminal mRNP-remodeling steps carried out by Dbp5. Here we find that deletion (\u0394) of both the Nup42 and Nup159 FG domains results in a cold-sensitive poly(A)+ mRNA export defect. The nup42\u0394FG nup159\u0394FG mutant also has synthetic lethal genetic interactions with dbp5 and gle1 mutants. RNA cross-linking experiments further indicate that the nup42\u0394FG nup159\u0394FG mutant has a reduced capacity for mRNP remodeling during export. To further analyze the role of these FG domains, we replaced the Nup159 or Nup42 FG domains with FG domains from other Nups. These FG \"swaps\" demonstrate that only certain FG domains are functional at the NPC cytoplasmic face. Strikingly, fusing the Nup42 FG domain to the carboxy-terminus of Gle1 bypasses the need for the endogenous Nup42 FG domain, highlighting the importance of proximal positioning for these factors. We conclude that the Nup42 and Nup159 FG domains target the mRNP to Gle1 and Dbp5 for mRNP remodeling at the NPC. Moreover, these results provide key evidence that character and context play a direct role in FG domain function and mRNA export. ",

Although SON was discovered 25 years ago, the importance of SON's function was only realized recently when its roles in nuclear organization and pre-mRNA splicing as well as the influence of these activities in maintaining cellular health were unveiled. Furthermore, SON was implicated to have a key role in stem cells as well as during the onset of various diseases such as cancer, influenza, and hepatitis.

    "abstract": "During the cell cycle the expression of replication-dependent histones is tightly coupled to DNA synthesis. Histone messenger RNA (mRNA) levels strongly increase during early S-phase and rapidly decrease at the end of it. Here, we review the degradation of replication-dependent histone mRNAs, a paradigm of post-transcriptional gene regulation, in the context of processing, translation, and oligouridylation. Replication-dependent histone transcripts are characterized by the absence of introns and by the presence of a stem-loop structure at the 3' end of a very short 3' untranslated region (UTR). These features, together with a need for active translation, are a prerequisite for their rapid decay. The degradation is induced by 3' end additions of untemplated uridines, performed by terminal uridyl transferases. Such 3' oligouridylated transcripts are preferentially bound by the heteroheptameric LSM1-7 complex, which also interacts with the 3'\u21925' exonuclease ERI1 (also called 3'hExo). Presumably in cooperation with LSM1-7 and aided by the helicase UPF1, ERI1 degrades through the stem-loop of oligouridylated histone mRNAs in repeated rounds of partial degradation and reoligouridylation. Although histone mRNA decay is now known in some detail, important questions remain open: How is ceasing nuclear DNA replication relayed to the cytoplasmic histone mRNA degradation? Why is translation important for this process? Recent research on factors such as SLIP1, DBP5, eIF3, CTIF, CBP80/20, and ERI1 has provided new insights into the 3' end formation, the nuclear export, and the translation of histone mRNAs. We discuss how these results fit with the preparation of histone mRNAs for degradation, which starts as early as these transcripts are generated.",

    "abstract": "N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A) is the most prevalent internal (non-cap) modification present in the messenger RNA of all higher eukaryotes. Although essential to cell viability and development, the exact role of m(6)A modification remains to be determined. The recent discovery of two m(6)A demethylases in mammalian cells highlighted the importance of m(6)A in basic biological functions and disease. Here we show that m(6)A is selectively recognized by the human YTH domain family 2 (YTHDF2) 'reader' protein to regulate mRNA degradation. We identified over 3,000 cellular RNA targets of YTHDF2, most of which are mRNAs, but which also include non-coding RNAs, with a conserved core motif of G(m(6)A)C. We further establish the role of YTHDF2 in RNA metabolism, showing that binding of YTHDF2 results in the localization of bound mRNA from the translatable pool to mRNA decay sites, such as processing bodies. The carboxy-terminal domain of YTHDF2 selectively binds to m(6)A-containing mRNA, whereas the amino-terminal domain is responsible for the localization of the YTHDF2-mRNA complex to cellular RNA decay sites. Our results indicate that the dynamic m(6)A modification is recognized by selectively binding proteins to affect the translation status and lifetime of mRNA. ",

    "abstract": "A critical step during gene expression is the directional export of nuclear messenger (m)RNA through nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) to the cytoplasm. During export, Gle1 in conjunction with inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) spatially regulates the activity of the DEAD-box protein Dbp5 at the NPC cytoplasmic face. GLE1 mutations are causally linked to the human diseases lethal congenital contracture syndrome 1 (LCCS-1) and lethal arthrogryposis with anterior horn cell disease (LAAHD). Here, structure prediction and functional analysis provide strong evidence to suggest that the LCCS-1 and LAAHD disease mutations disrupt the function of Gle1 in mRNA export. Strikingly, direct fluorescence microscopy in living cells reveals a dramatic loss of steady-state NPC localization for GFP-gle1 proteins expressed from human gle1 genes harboring LAAHD and LCCS-1 mutations. The potential significance of these residues is further clarified by analyses of sequence and predicted structural conservation. This work offers insights into the perturbed mechanisms underlying human LCCS-1 and LAAHD disease states and emphasizes the potential impact of altered mRNA transport and gene expression in human disease.

    "abstract": "DEAD-box proteins are involved in all aspects of RNA processing. They bind RNA in an ATP-dependent manner and couple ATP hydrolysis to structural and compositional rearrangements of ribonucleoprotein particles. Conformational control is a major point of regulation for DEAD-box proteins to act on appropriate substrates and in a timely manner in vivo. Binding partners containing a middle domain of translation initiation factor 4G (MIF4G) are emerging as important regulators. Well-known examples are eIF4G and Gle1, which bind and activate the DEAD-box proteins eIF4A and Dbp5. Here, we report the mechanism of an inhibiting MIF4G domain. We determined the 2.0-\u00c5 resolution structure of the complex of human eIF4AIII and the MIF4G domain of the splicing factor Complexed With Cef1 (CWC22), an essential prerequisite for exon junction complex assembly by the splicing machinery. The CWC22 MIF4G domain binds both RecA domains of eIF4AIII. The mode of RecA2 recognition is similar to that observed in the activating complexes, yet is specific for eIF4AIII. The way the CWC22 MIF4G domain latches on the eIF4AIII RecA1 domain is markedly different from activating complexes. In the CWC22-eIF4AIII complex, the RNA-binding and ATP-binding motifs of the two RecA domains do not face each other, as would be required in the active state, but are in diametrically opposite positions. The binding mode of CWC22 to eIF4AIII reveals a facet of how MIF4G domains use their versatile structural frameworks to activate or inhibit DEAD-box proteins.",

    "abstract": "The SON protein is a ubiquitously expressed DNA- and RNA-binding protein primarily localized to nuclear speckles. Although several early studies implicated SON in DNA-binding, tumorigenesis and apoptosis, functional significance of this protein had not been recognized until recent studies discovered SON as a novel RNA splicing co-factor. During constitutive RNA splicing, SON ensures efficient intron removal from the transcripts containing suboptimal splice sites. Importantly, SON-mediated splicing is required for proper processing of selective transcripts related to cell cycle, microtubules, centrosome maintenance, and genome stability. Moreover, SON regulates alternative splicing of RNAs from the genes involved in apoptosis and epigenetic modification. In addition to the role in RNA splicing, SON has an ability to suppress transcriptional activation at certain promoter/enhancer DNA sequences. Considering the multiple SON target genes which are directly involved in cell proliferation, genome stability and chromatin modifications, SON is an emerging player in gene regulation during cancer development and progression. Here, we summarize available information from several early studies on SON, and highlight recent discoveries describing molecular mechanisms of SON-mediated gene regulation. We propose that our future effort on better understanding of diverse SON functions would reveal novel targets for cancer therapy.",

    "abstract": "Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) harbour the ability to undergo lineage-specific differentiation into clinically relevant cell types. Transcription factors and epigenetic modifiers are known to play important roles in the maintenance of pluripotency of hESCs. However, little is known about regulation of pluripotency through splicing. In this study, we identify the spliceosome-associated factor SON as a factor essential for the maintenance of hESCs. Depletion of SON in hESCs results in the loss of pluripotency and cell death. Using genome-wide RNA profiling, we identified transcripts that are regulated by SON. Importantly, we confirmed that SON regulates the proper splicing of transcripts encoding for pluripotency regulators such as OCT4, PRDM14, E4F1 and MED24. Furthermore, we show that SON is bound to these transcripts in\u00a0vivo. In summary, we connect a splicing-regulatory network for accurate transcript production to the maintenance of pluripotency and self-renewal of hESCs. ",

    "abstract": "In metazoans, replication-dependent histone mRNAs end in a stem-loop structure instead of the poly(A) tail characteristic of all other mature mRNAs. This specialized 3' end is bound by stem-loop binding protein (SLBP), a protein that participates in the nuclear export and translation of histone mRNAs. The translational activity of SLBP is mediated by interaction with SLIP1, a middle domain of initiation factor 4G (MIF4G)-like protein that connects to translation initiation. We determined the 2.5 \u00c5 resolution crystal structure of zebrafish SLIP1 bound to the translation-activation domain of SLBP and identified the determinants of the recognition. We discovered a SLIP1-binding motif (SBM) in two additional proteins: the translation initiation factor eIF3g and the mRNA-export factor DBP5. We confirmed the binding of SLIP1 to DBP5 and eIF3g by pull-down assays and determined the 3.25 \u00c5 resolution structure of SLIP1 bound to the DBP5 SBM. The SBM-binding and homodimerization residues of SLIP1 are conserved in the MIF4G domain of CBP80/20-dependent translation initiation factor (CTIF). The results suggest how the SLIP1 homodimer or a SLIP1-CTIF heterodimer can function as platforms to bridge SLBP with SBM-containing proteins involved in different steps of mRNA metabolism. ",

    "abstract": "Rate control analysis defines the in vivo control map governing yeast protein synthesis and generates an extensively parameterized digital model of the translation pathway. Among other non-intuitive outcomes, translation demonstrates a high degree of functional modularity and comprises a non-stoichiometric combination of proteins manifesting functional convergence on a shared maximal translation rate. In exponentially growing cells, polypeptide elongation (eEF1A, eEF2, and eEF3) exerts the strongest control. The two other strong control points are recruitment of mRNA and tRNA(i) to the 40S ribosomal subunit (eIF4F and eIF2) and termination (eRF1; Dbp5). In contrast, factors that are found to promote mRNA scanning efficiency on a longer than-average 5'untranslated region (eIF1, eIF1A, Ded1, eIF2B, eIF3, and eIF5) exceed the levels required for maximal control. This is expected to allow the cell to minimize scanning transition times, particularly for longer 5'UTRs. The analysis reveals these and other collective adaptations of control shared across the factors, as well as features that reflect functional modularity and system robustness. Remarkably, gene duplication is implicated in the fine control of cellular protein synthesis.",

    "abstract": "Numerous molecular details of intracellular mRNA processing have been revealed in recent years. However, the export process of single native mRNA molecules, the actual translocation through the nuclear pore complex (NPC), could not yet be examined in vivo. The problem is observing mRNA molecules without interfering with their native behavior. We used a protein-based labeling approach to visualize single native mRNPs in live salivary gland cells of Chironomus tentans, an iconic system used for decades to study the mRNA life cycle. Recombinant hrp36, the C. tentans homolog of mammalian hnRNP A1, was fluorescence labeled and microinjected into living cells, where it was integrated into nascent mRNPs. Intranuclear trajectories of single mRNPs, including their NPC passage, were observed with high space and time resolution employing a custom-built light sheet fluorescence microscope. We analyzed the kinetics and dynamics of mRNP export and started to study its mechanism and regulation by measuring the turnover-kinetics of single Dbp5 at the NPC.",

    "abstract": "SON is a DNA- and RNA-binding protein localized in nuclear speckles. Although its function in RNA splicing for effective cell cycle progression and genome stability was recently unveiled, other mechanisms of SON functions remain unexplored. Here, we report that SON regulates GATA-2, a key transcription factor involved in hematopoietic stem cell maintenance and differentiation. SON is highly expressed in undifferentiated hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells and leukemic blasts. SON knockdown leads to significant depletion of GATA-2 protein with marginal down-regulation of GATA-2 mRNA. We show that miR-27a is up-regulated upon SON knockdown and targets the 3'-UTR of GATA-2 mRNA in hematopoietic cells. Up-regulation of miR-27a was due to activation of the promoter of the miR-23a\u223c27a\u223c24-2 cluster, suggesting that SON suppresses this promoter to lower the microRNAs from this cluster. Our data revealed a previously unidentified role of SON in microRNA production via regulating the transcription process, thereby modulating GATA-2 at the protein level during hematopoietic differentiation.",

    "abstract": "Pancreatic cancer is characterized by constitutive activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Activation of MAPK is associated with the upregulation of genes implicated in the proliferation and survival of pancreatic cancer cells. We hypothesized that knockdown of these MAPK-associated molecules could produce notable anticancer phenotypes.\nA RNA interference-mediated knockdown screening of 78 MAPK-associated molecules previously identified was performed to find molecules specifically associated with proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells in vitro. Expression of an identified molecule in pancreatic cancer tissues was examined by immunohistochemistry. In vivo tumorigenicity of cancer cells with stable knockdown of the molecule was assayed by using xenograft models. Flow cytometry and live cell imaging were employed to assess an association of the molecule with cell cycle.\nThe knockdown screening revealed that knockdown of SON, the gene encoding SON, which is a large serine/arginine-rich protein involved in RNA processing, substantially suppressed pancreatic cancer cell proliferation and survival in vitro and tumorigenicity in vivo. SON expression was higher in ductal adenocarcinomas than in cells of normal ducts and precursor lesions in pancreatic cancer tissues. Knockdown of SON induced G2/M arrest and apoptosis in cultured cancer cells. The suppressive effect of SON knockdown on proliferation was less pronounced in cultured normal duct epithelial cells. SON formed nuclear speckles in the interphase of the cell cycle and dispersed in the cytoplasm during mitosis. Live cell imaging showed that SON diffusely dispersed in the early mitotic phase, accumulated in some foci in the cytoplasm in the late mitotic phase, and gradually reassembled into speckles after mitosis.\nThese results indicate that SON plays a critical role in the proliferation, survival, and tumorigenicity of pancreatic cancer cells, suggesting that SON is a novel therapeutic molecular target for pancreatic cancer.",

    "abstract": "The DEAD-box RNA helicase Dbp5 is an essential and conserved mRNA export factor which functions in the ATP dependent remodeling of RNA/protein complexes. As such it displaces mRNA bound proteins at the cytoplasmic site of the nuclear pore complex. For the regulation of its RNA-dependent ATPase activity during late steps of nuclear transport, Dbp5 requires the nucleoporin Nup159 and its cofactors Gle1 and IP6. In addition to its role in mRNA export, a second important function of Dbp5 was identified in translation termination, where it acts together with eRF1 once the translation machinery has reached the stop codon. Similar to mRNA export, this function also requires Gle1-IP6, however, the counterpart of Nup159 is still missing. Potential other functions of the nucleo-cytoplasmic protein Dbp5 are discussed as well as its substrate specificity and details in its regulatory cycle that are based on recent biochemical and structural characterization. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: The Biology of RNA helicases - Modulation for life.",

    "abstract": "The various steps of mRNP biogenesis (transcription, processing and export) are interconnected. It has been shown that the transcription machinery plays a pivotal role in mRNP assembly, since several mRNA export factors are recruited during transcription and physically interact with components of the transcription machinery. Although the shuttling DEAD-box protein Dbp5p is concentrated on the cytoplasmic fibrils of the NPC, previous studies demonstrated that it interacts physically and genetically with factors involved in transcription initiation.\nWe investigated the effect of mutations affecting various components of the transcription initiation apparatus on the phenotypes of mRNA export mutant strains. Our results show that growth and mRNA export defects of dbp5 and mex67 mutant strains can be suppressed by mutation of specific transcription initiation components, but suppression was not observed for mutants acting in the very first steps of the pre-initiation complex (PIC) formation.\nOur results indicate that mere reduction in the amount of mRNP produced is not sufficient to suppress the defects caused by a defective mRNA export factor. Suppression occurs only with mutants affecting events within a narrow window of the mRNP biogenesis process. We propose that reducing the speed with which transcription converts from initiation and promoter clearance to elongation may have a positive effect on mRNP formation by permitting more effective recruitment of partially-functional mRNP proteins to the nascent mRNP.",

    "abstract": "DEAD-box ATPases/helicases are a large family of enzymes (>35 in humans) involved in almost all aspects of RNA metabolism including ribosome biogenesis, RNA splicing, export, translation, and decay. Many members of this family are ATP-dependent RNA-binding proteins that interact with the RNA phosphodiester backbone and promote structural remodeling of target complexes through ATP binding and hydrolysis. Here, we describe the methods used in our laboratory to characterize the DEAD-box ATPase Dbp5 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Dbp5 is essential for the process of mRNA export in budding yeast and highly conserved orthologs can be found in all eukaryotes. Specifically, we describe enzyme assays to measure the catalytic activity of Dbp5 in association with RNA and known binding partners, as well as assays developed to measure the binding affinities and release kinetics of RNA and adenosine nucleotides from Dbp5. These assays have provided important information that has shaped our current models of Dbp5 function in mRNA export and should be useful for the characterization of other DEAD-box family members.",

    "abstract": "Nuclear export of mRNA is a key transport process in eukaryotic cells. To investigate it, we labeled native mRNP particles in living Chironomus tentans salivary gland cells with fluorescent hrp36, the hnRNP A1 homolog, and the nuclear envelope by fluorescent NTF2. Using light sheet microscopy, we traced single native mRNA particles across the nuclear envelope. The particles were observed to often probe nuclear pore complexes (NPC) at their nuclear face, and in only 25% of the cases yielded actual export. The complete export process took between 65 ms up to several seconds. A rate-limiting step was observed, which could be assigned to the nuclear basket of the pore and might correspond to a repositioning and unfolding of mRNPs before the actual translocation. Analysis of single fluorescent Dbp5 molecules, the RNA helicase essential for mRNA export, revealed that Dbp5 most often approached the cytoplasmic face of the NPC, and exhibited a binding duration of approximately 55 ms. Our results have allowed a refinement of the current models for mRNA export.",

    "abstract": "Polyadenylation regulation and efficient nuclear export of mature mRNPs both require the polyadenosine-RNA-binding protein, Nab2, which contains seven CCCH Zn fingers. We describe here the solution structure of fingers 5-7, which are necessary and sufficient for high-affinity polyadenosine-RNA binding, and identify key residues involved. These Zn fingers form a single structural unit. Structural coherence is lost in the RNA-binding compromised Nab2-C437S mutant, which also suppresses the rat8-2 allele of RNA helicase Dbp5. Structure-guided Nab2 variants indicate that dbp5(rat8-2) suppression is more closely linked to hyperadenylation and suppression of mutant alleles of the nuclear RNA export adaptor, Yra1, than to affinity for polyadenosine-RNA. These results indicate that, in addition to modulating polyA tail length, Nab2 has an unanticipated function associated with generating export-competent mRNPs, and that changes within fingers 5-7 lead to suboptimal assembly of mRNP export complexes that are more easily disassembled by Dbp5 upon reaching the cytoplasm.",

    "abstract": "Most of the individual components of the nuclear elements of the gene expression pathway have been identified and high-resolution structural information is becoming available for many of them. Information is also starting to become available on the larger complexes they form and is beginning to give clues about how the dynamics of their interactions generate function. Although the translocation of export-competent messenger ribonucleoprotein particles (mRNPs) through the nuclear pore transport channel that is mediated by interactions with nuclear pore proteins (nucleoporins) is relatively well understood, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying the assembly of export-competent mRNPs in the nucleus and their Dbp5-mediated disassembly in the cytoplasm is less well defined. Considerable information has been obtained on the structure of Dbp5 in its different nucleotide-bound states and in complex with Gle1 or Nup159/NUP214. Although the precise manner by which the Dbp5 ATPase cycle is coupled to mRNP remodelling remains to be established, current models capture many key details of this process. The formation of export-competent mRNPs in the nucleus remains an elusive component of this pathway and the precise nature of the remodelling that generates these mRNPs as well as detailed understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which this step is integrated with the transcriptional, splicing and polyadenylation machinery by the TREX and TREX-2 complexes remain obscure.

    "abstract": "Serine-arginine-rich (SR) proteins play a key role in alternative pre-mRNA splicing in eukaryotes. We recently showed that a large SR protein called Son has unique repeat motifs that are essential for maintaining the subnuclear organization of pre-mRNA processing factors in nuclear speckles. Motif analysis of Son highlights putative RNA interaction domains that suggest a direct role for Son in pre-mRNA splicing. Here, we used in situ approaches to show that Son localizes to a reporter minigene transcription site, and that RNAi-mediated Son depletion causes exon skipping on reporter transcripts at this transcription site. A genome-wide exon microarray analysis was performed to identify human transcription and splicing targets of Son. Our data show that Son-regulated splicing encompasses all known types of alternative splicing, the most common being alternative splicing of cassette exons. We confirmed that knockdown of Son leads to exon skipping in pre-mRNAs for chromatin-modifying enzymes, including ADA, HDAC6 and SetD8. This study reports a comprehensive view of human transcription and splicing targets for Son in fundamental cellular pathways such as integrin-mediated cell adhesion, cell cycle regulation, cholesterol biosynthesis, apoptosis and epigenetic regulation of gene expression.",

    "abstract": "Gene expression is a stepwise process involving distinct cellular processes including transcription, mRNA (mRNA) processing, mRNA export, and translation. As mRNAs are being synthesized, proteins associate with the RNA to form messenger ribonucleoprotein particles (mRNPs). Previous studies have demonstrated that the RNA-binding protein composition of these mRNPs is dynamic, changing as the mRNP moves through the different steps of gene expression, and playing a critical role in these events. An important step during this maturation process occurs at the cytoplasmic face of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) where the export protein Gle1 bound to inositol hexakisphosphate (IP 6) spatially activates the ATP-hydrolysis and mRNP-remodeling activity of the DEAD-box protein Dbp5. Recent work from our laboratory and others has provided important insights into the function and regulation of Dbp5. These include a more detailed explanation of the mechanism of Dbp5 RNP remodeling, the role of Gle1-IP6 in stimulating Dbp5 ATPase activity, and the identification of a novel paradigm for regulation of Dbp5 by Nup159. Based on in vitro biochemical assays, X-ray crystallography, and corresponding in vivo phenotypes, we propose here an updated model of the Dbp5 cycle during mRNP export through the NPC. This takes into account all available data and provides a platform for future studies.",

    "abstract": "DEAD-box protein (Dbp) family members are essential for gene expression; however, their precise roles and regulation are not fully defined. During messenger (m)RNA export, Gle1 bound to inositol hexakisphosphate (IP(6)) acts via Dbp5 to facilitate remodeling of mRNA-protein complexes. In contrast, here we define a novel Gle1 role in translation initiation through regulation of a different DEAD-box protein, the initiation factor Ded1. We find that Gle1 physically and genetically interacts with Ded1. Surprisingly, whereas Gle1 stimulates Dbp5, it inhibits Ded1 ATPase activity in vitro, and IP(6) does not affect this inhibition. Functionally, a gle1-4 mutant specifically suppresses initiation defects in a ded1-120 mutant, and ded1 and gle1 mutants have complementary perturbations in AUG start site recognition. Consistent with this role in initiation, Gle1 inhibits translation in vitro in competent extracts. These results indicate that Gle1 has a direct role in initiation and negatively regulates Ded1. Together, the differential regulation of two distinct DEAD-box proteins by a common factor (Gle1) establishes a new paradigm for controlling gene expression and coupling translation with mRNA export.",

    "abstract": "Essential messenger RNA (mRNA) export factors execute critical steps to mediate directional transport through nuclear pore complexes (NPCs). At cytoplasmic NPC filaments, the ATPase activity of DEAD-box protein Dbp5 is activated by inositol hexakisphosphate (IP(6))-bound Gle1 to mediate remodeling of mRNA-protein (mRNP) complexes. Whether a single Dbp5 executes multiple remodeling events and how Dbp5 is recycled are unknown. Evidence suggests that Dbp5 binding to Nup159 is required for controlling interactions with Gle1 and the mRNP. Using in vitro reconstitution assays, we found here that Nup159 is specifically required for ADP release from Dbp5. Moreover, Gle1-IP(6) stimulates ATP binding, thus priming Dbp5 for RNA loading. In vivo, a dbp5-R256D/R259D mutant with reduced ADP binding bypasses the need for Nup159 interaction. However, NPC spatial control is important, as a dbp5-R256D/R259D nup42\u0394 double mutant is temperature-sensitive for mRNA export. Further analysis reveals that remodeling requires a conformational shift to the Dbp5-ADP form. ADP release factors for DEAD-box proteins have not been reported previously and reflect a new paradigm for regulation. We propose a model wherein Nup159 and Gle1-IP(6) regulate Dbp5 cycles by controlling its nucleotide-bound state, allowing multiple cycles of mRNP remodeling by a single Dbp5 at the NPC.",

    "abstract": "Nuclear export of messenger RNA (mRNA) occurs by translocation of mRNA/protein complexes (mRNPs) through nuclear pore complexes (NPCs). The DEAD-box protein Dbp5 mediates export by triggering removal of mRNP proteins in a spatially controlled manner. This requires Dbp5 interaction with Nup159 in NPC cytoplasmic filaments and activation of Dbp5's ATPase activity by Gle1 bound to inositol hexakisphosphate (IP(6)). However, the precise sequence of events within this mechanism has not been fully defined. Here we analyze dbp5 mutants that alter ATP binding, ATP hydrolysis, or RNA binding. We found that ATP binding and hydrolysis are required for efficient Dbp5 association with NPCs. Interestingly, mutants defective for RNA binding are dominant-negative (DN) for mRNA export in yeast and human cells. We show that the DN phenotype stems from competition with wild-type Dbp5 for Gle1 at NPCs. The Dbp5-Gle1 interaction is limiting for export and, importantly, can be independent of Nup159. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching experiments in yeast show a very dynamic association between Dbp5 and NPCs, averaging <1 sec, similar to reported NPC translocation rates for mRNPs. This work reveals critical steps in the Gle1-IP(6)/Dbp5/Nup159 cycle, and suggests that the number of remodeling events mediated by a single Dbp5 is limited.",

    "abstract": "It has been suspected that cell-cycle progression might be functionally coupled with RNA processing. However, little is known about the role of the precise splicing control in cell-cycle progression. Here, we report that SON, a large Ser/Arg (SR)-related protein, is a splicing cofactor contributing to efficient splicing of cell-cycle regulators. Downregulation of SON leads to severe impairment of spindle pole separation, microtubule dynamics, and genome integrity. These molecular defects result from inadequate RNA splicing of a specific set of cell-cycle-related genes that possess weak splice sites. Furthermore, we show that SON facilitates the interaction of SR proteins with RNA polymerase II and other key spliceosome components, suggesting its function in efficient cotranscriptional RNA processing. These results reveal a mechanism for controlling cell-cycle progression through SON-dependent constitutive splicing at suboptimal splice sites, with strong implications for its role in cancer and other human diseases.",

    "abstract": "Superfamily 1 and superfamily 2 RNA helicases are ubiquitous messenger-RNA-protein complex (mRNP) remodelling enzymes that have critical roles in all aspects of RNA metabolism. The superfamily 2 DEAD-box ATPase Dbp5 (human DDX19) functions in mRNA export and is thought to remodel mRNPs at the nuclear pore complex (NPC). Dbp5 is localized to the NPC via an interaction with Nup159 (NUP214 in vertebrates) and is locally activated there by Gle1 together with the small-molecule inositol hexakisphosphate (InsP(6)). Local activation of Dbp5 at the NPC by Gle1 is essential for mRNA export in vivo; however, the mechanistic role of Dbp5 in mRNP export is poorly understood and it is not known how Gle1(InsP6) and Nup159 regulate the activity of Dbp5. Here we report, from yeast, structures of Dbp5 in complex with Gle1(InsP6), Nup159/Gle1(InsP6) and RNA. These structures reveal that InsP(6) functions as a small-molecule tether for the Gle1-Dbp5 interaction. Surprisingly, the Gle1(InsP6)-Dbp5 complex is structurally similar to another DEAD-box ATPase complex essential for translation initiation, eIF4G-eIF4A, and we demonstrate that Gle1(InsP6) and eIF4G both activate their DEAD-box partner by stimulating RNA release. Furthermore, Gle1(InsP6) relieves Dbp5 autoregulation and cooperates with Nup159 in stabilizing an open Dbp5 intermediate that precludes RNA binding. These findings explain how Gle1(InsP6), Nup159 and Dbp5 collaborate in mRNA export and provide a general mechanism for DEAD-box ATPase regulation by Gle1/eIF4G-like activators.",

    "abstract": "Helicases are ubiquitous essential enzymes which have significant role in the nucleic acid metabolism. Using in silico approaches in the recent past we have identified a number of helicases in the Plasmodium falciparum genome. In the present study we report purification and detailed characterization of a novel helicase from P. falciparum. Our results indicate that this helicase is a homologue of Dbp5 and DDX19 from yeast and human, respectively. The biochemical characterization shows that it contains DNA and RNA unwinding, nucleic acid dependent ATPase and RNA binding activities. It is interesting to note that this enzyme can unwind DNA duplexes in both 5' to 3' and 3' to 5' directions. Using truncated derivatives we further show that Q motif is essentially required for all of its activities. These studies should make an important contribution in understanding the enzymes involved in nucleic acid metabolism in the parasite.",

    "abstract": "In eukaryotes, translation termination requires two eukaryotic release factors, eRF1 and eRF3. eRF1 is required for recognition of the stop codon and eRF3 supports the polypeptide chain release in a GTP dependent manner. Recently, several new players in translation termination have been identified. The DEAD-box RNA helicase Dbp5 has been shown to support eRF1 in stop codon recognition, possibly by proper placement of the release factor on the termination codon. Upon its dissociation from eRF1, Dbp5 allows the entry of the second termination factor eRF3 into the complex. Further, the Dbp5 interacting protein Gle1 and its co-factor inositol hexakisphosphate (IP 6) have been shown to participate in the termination process. Dbp5 and Gle1 are well known for their function in mRNA export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Most interestingly, also the ATP binding cassette (ABC) protein Rli1, which requires the mitochondrial and cytosolic Fe/S protein biogenesis machineries for its assembly, has recently been shown to function in translation termination and recycling of the ribosomes. Rli1 physically and genetically interacts with both, eRF1 and eRF3. Together, all of these novel termination factors modulate in association with the release factors more accurate stop codon recognition and these findings broaden our knowledge about the final steps in translation.",

    "abstract": "Leptin, the product of the ob gene, plays important roles in the regulation of food intake and body weight through its receptor in the hypothalamus. To identify novel transcripts induced by leptin, we performed cDNA subtraction based on selective suppression of the polymerase chain reaction by using mRNA prepared from the forebrain of leptin-injected ob/ob mice. One of the genes isolated was a mouse homolog of human negative regulatory element-binding protein (NREBP). Its expression was markedly increased by leptin in the growth hormone secretagogue-receptor (GHS-R)-positive neurons of the arcuate nucleus and ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus. The promoter region of GHS-R contains one NREBP binding sequence, suggesting that NREBP regulates GHS-R transcription. Luciferase reporter assays showed that NREBP repressed GHS-R promoter activity in a hypothalamic neuronal cell line, GT1-7, and its repressive activity was abolished by the replacement of negative regulatory element in GHS-R promoter. Overexpression of NREBP reduced the protein expression of endogenous GHS-R without affecting the expression of ob-Rb in GT1-7 cells. To determine the functional importance of NREBP in the hypothalamus, we assessed the effects of NREBP on ghrelin action. Although phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase \u03b1 (AMPK\u03b1) was induced by ghrelin in GT1-7 cells, NREBP repressed ghrelin-induced AMPK\u03b1 phosphorylation. These results suggest that leptin-induced NREBP is an important regulator of GHS-R expression in the hypothalamus and provides a novel molecular link between leptin and ghrelin signaling.",

    "abstract": "Nuclear export of mRNAs is one of the steps critically important for gene expression and different steps of mRNA processing are linked to the export of the mRNA out of the nucleus. This coupling probably provides a quality control mechanism as well as a higher efficiency for the synthesis of mRNAs. The mRNA is synthesized in the nucleus and then exported to the cytoplasm through the nuclear pore complexes (NPCs), which are embedded in the nuclear envelope. The Mex67-Mtr2 complex in yeast and its counterpart Tap-p15 in higher eukaryotes function as an mRNA exporter through the NPC. Some of the DEAD box proteins such as UAP56 and Dbp5 have been implicated in mRNA export also. In this report using the bioinformatics approach we have analyzed the components of the mRNA export machinery in Plasmodium falciparum and also highlighted the salient features of some of the components. Further detailed studies on various components of nuclear mRNA export in Plasmodium falciparum will be essential to understand this important pathway.",

    "abstract": "Alternative splicing (AS) of pre-mRNA is utilized by higher eukaryotes to achieve increased transcriptome and proteomic complexity. The serine/arginine (SR) splicing factors regulate tissue- or cell-type-specific AS in a concentration- and phosphorylation-dependent manner. However, the mechanisms that modulate the cellular levels of active SR proteins remain to be elucidated. In the present study, we provide evidence for a role for the long nuclear-retained regulatory RNA (nrRNA), MALAT1 in AS regulation. MALAT1 interacts with SR proteins and influences the distribution of these and other splicing factors in nuclear speckle domains. Depletion of MALAT1 or overexpression of an SR protein changes the AS of a similar set of endogenous pre-mRNAs. Furthermore, MALAT1 regulates cellular levels of phosphorylated forms of SR proteins. Taken together, our results suggest that MALAT1 regulates AS by modulating the levels of active SR proteins. Our results further highlight the role for an nrRNA in the regulation of gene expression.",

    "abstract": "The eukaryotic RNA splicing machinery is dedicated to the daunting task of excising intronic sequences on the many nascent RNA transcripts in a cell, and in doing so facilitates proper translation of its transcriptome. Notably, emerging evidence suggests that RNA splicing may also play direct roles in maintaining genome stability. Here we report the identification of the RNA/DNA-binding protein SON as a component of spliceosome that plays pleiotropic roles during mitotic progression. We found that SON is essential for cell proliferation, and that its inactivation triggers a MAD2-dependent mitotic delay. Moreover, SON deficiency is accompanied by defective chromosome congression, compromised chromosome segregation and cytokinesis, which in turn contributes to cellular aneuploidy and cell death. In summary, our study uncovers a specific link between SON and mitosis, and highlights the potential of RNA processing as additional regulatory mechanisms that govern cell proliferation and division.",

    "abstract": "Following transcription, mRNA is processed, packaged into messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) particles, and transported through nuclear pores (NPCs) to the cytoplasm. At the NPC cytoplasmic face, Dbp5 mediates mRNP remodeling and mRNA export factor dissociation, releasing transcripts for translation. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the conserved poly(A) RNA-binding protein, Nab2, facilitates NPC targeting of transcripts and also modulates poly(A) tail length. Dbp5 removes Nab2 from mRNPs at the cytoplasmic face of the pore and, importantly, a Nab2 RNA-binding mutant suppresses the thermosensitive rat8-2 (dbp5) mutant. GFD1 is a multicopy suppressor of rat8-2 (dbp5), and Gfd1 interacts physically with both Dbp5 and the Nab2 N-terminal domain (Nab2-N). Here, we present a structural and functional analysis of the Gfd1/Nab2-N interaction. Crystallography, supported by solution NMR, shows that Gfd1 residues 126-150 form an alpha-helix when bound to Nab2-N. Engineered Nab2-N and Gfd1 mutants that inhibit this interaction in vitro were used to probe its function in vivo using the genetic interaction between GFD1 and NAB2. Although GFD1 is not essential for viability, its deletion severely impairs growth of rat8-2 (dbp5) cells. Moreover, although Gfd1 overexpression suppresses rat8-2 (dbp5), Gfd1 mutants that do not bind Nab2 only partially suppress rat8-2 (dbp5). Furthermore, rat8-2 (dbp5) cells that express nab2-Y34A, in which binding to Gfd1 is impaired, show a synthetic growth phenotype and nuclear accumulation of poly(A) RNA. These data support the importance of the Gfd1/Nab2 interaction for Dbp5 activity and provide further molecular details of the interactions that facilitate Dbp5-mediated mRNP remodeling in the terminal step of mRNA export.",

    "abstract": "The unidirectional translocation of messenger RNA (mRNA) through the aqueous channel of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) is mediated by interactions between soluble mRNA export factors and distinct binding sites on the NPC. At the cytoplasmic side of the NPC, the conserved mRNA export factors Gle1 and inositol hexakisphosphate (IP(6)) play an essential role in mRNA export by activating the ATPase activity of the DEAD-box protein Dbp5, promoting localized messenger ribonucleoprotein complex remodeling, and ensuring the directionality of the export process. In addition, Dbp5, Gle1, and IP(6) are also required for proper translation termination. However, the specificity of the IP(6)-Gle1 interaction in vivo is unknown. Here, we characterize the biochemical interaction between Gle1 and IP(6) and the relationship to Dbp5 binding and stimulation. We identify Gle1 residues required for IP(6) binding and show that these residues are needed for IP(6)-dependent Dbp5 stimulation in vitro. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Gle1 is the primary target of IP(6) for both mRNA export and translation termination in vivo. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells, the IP(6)-binding mutants recapitulate all of the mRNA export and translation termination defects found in mutants depleted of IP(6). We conclude that Gle1 specifically binds IP(6) and that this interaction is required for the full potentiation of Dbp5 ATPase activity during both mRNA export and translation termination.",

    "abstract": "Subnuclear organization and spatiotemporal regulation of pre-mRNA processing factors is essential for the production of mature protein-coding mRNAs. We have discovered that a large protein called Son has a novel role in maintaining proper nuclear organization of pre-mRNA processing factors in nuclear speckles. The primary sequence of Son contains a concentrated region of multiple unique tandem repeat motifs that may support a role for Son as a scaffolding protein for RNA processing factors in nuclear speckles. We used RNA interference (RNAi) approaches and high-resolution microscopy techniques to study the functions of Son in the context of intact cells. Although Son precisely colocalizes with pre-mRNA splicing factors in nuclear speckles, its depletion by RNAi leads to cell cycle arrest in metaphase and causes dramatic disorganization of small nuclear ribonuclear protein and serine-arginine rich protein splicing factors during interphase. Here, we propose that Son is essential for appropriate subnuclear organization of pre-mRNA splicing factors and for promoting normal cell cycle progression.",

    "abstract": "Nuclear export of mRNA is a critical event in mRNA biogenesis. Passage of mature messenger ribonucleoproteins (mRNPs) through nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) is facilitated by the Mex67/Mtr2 heterodimer. At the NPC cytoplasmic face, the DEAD-box RNA helicase Dbp5 remodels mRNPs by removing Mex67/Mtr2. This remodeling process prevents mRNPs from returning to the nucleus, thereby imposing unidirectionality on mRNA export. Biochemical studies show that Gle1 and inositol hexaphosphate (IP6) activate Dbp5's ATPase activity at the cytoplasmic face of NPC, therefore providing critical spatial regulation of mRNP remodeling during directional transport. Recent structural studies on Dbp5 in free form and in complex with its ligands (ADP, AMPPNP/RNA) as well as with cytoplasmic nucleoporin Nup214 reveal that the binding of ADP or AMPPNP/RNA induces large conformational changes of Dbp5, and RNA and NUP214 bind to Dbp5 in a mutually exclusive manner. These structural data combined with complementary functional analysis significantly advance our understanding on the mechanism governing mRNA export albeit some key issues remain elusive.",

    "abstract": "The DExD/H-box RNA-dependent ATPase Dbp5 plays an essential role in the nuclear export of mRNA. Dbp5 localizes to the nuclear pore complex, where its ATPase activity is stimulated by Gle1 and its coactivator inositol hexakisphosphate. Here, we present the crystal structure of the C-terminal domain of Dbp5, refined to 1.8 A. The structure reveals a RecA-like fold that contains two defining characteristics not present in other structurally characterized DExD/H-box proteins: a C-terminal alpha-helix and a loop connecting beta5 and alpha4, both of which are composed of conserved and unique elements in the Dbp5 primary sequence. Using structure-guided mutagenesis, we have identified several charged surface residues that, when mutated, weaken the binding of Gle1 and inhibit the ability of Gle1 to stimulate Dbp5's ATPase activity. In vivo analysis of the same mutations reveals that those mutants displaying the weakest ATPase stimulation in vitro are also unable to support yeast growth. Analysis of the correlation between the in vitro and in vivo data indicates that a threshold level of Dbp5 ATPase activity is required for cellular mRNA export that is not met by the unstimulated enzyme, suggesting a possible mechanism by which Dbp5's activity can be modulated to regulate mRNA export.",

    "abstract": "The conserved mRNA export receptor NXF1 (Mex67 in yeast) assembles with messenger ribonucleoproteins (mRNP) in the nucleus and guides them through the nuclear pore complex into the cytoplasm. The DEAD family RNA helicase Dbp5 is essential for nuclear export of mRNA and is thought to dissociate Mex67 from mRNP upon translocation, thereby generating directional passage. However, the molecular mechanism by which Dbp5 recognizes Mex67-containing mRNP is not clear. Here we report that the human NXF1-binding protein RBM15 binds specifically to human DBP5 and facilitates its direct contact with mRNA in vivo. We found that RBM15 is targeted to the nuclear envelope, where it colocalizes extensively with DBP5 and NXF1. Gene silencing of RBM15 leads to cytoplasmic depletion and nuclear accumulation of general mRNA as well as individual endogenous transcripts, indicating that RBM15 is required for efficient mRNA export. We propose a model in which RBM15 acts locally at the nuclear pore complex, by facilitating the recognition of NXF1-mRNP complexes by DBP5 during translocation, thereby contributing to efficient mRNA export.",

    "abstract": "The interphase nucleus is a highly ordered and compartmentalized organelle. Little is known regarding what elaborate mechanisms might exist to explain these properties of the nucleus. Also unresolved is whether some architectural components might facilitate the formation of functional intranuclear compartments or higher order chromatin structure. As the first step to address these questions, we performed an in-depth proteome analysis of nuclear insoluble fractions of human HeLa-S3 cells prepared by two different approaches: a high-salt/detergent/nuclease-resistant fraction and a lithium 3,5-diiodosalicylate/nuclease-resistant fraction. Proteins of the fractions were analyzed by liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry, identifying 333 and 330 proteins from each fraction respectively. Among the insoluble nuclear proteins, we identified 37 hitherto unknown or functionally uncharacterized proteins. The RNA recognition motif, WD40 repeats, HEAT repeats and the SAP domain were often found in these identified proteins. The subcellular distribution of selected proteins, including DEK protein and SON protein, demonstrated their novel associations with nuclear insoluble materials, corroborating our MS-based analysis. This study establishes a comprehensive catalog of the nuclear insoluble proteins in human cells. Further functional analysis of the proteins identified in our study will significantly improve our understanding of the dynamic organization of the interphase nucleus.",

Project HeartBeat! investigated trajectories of change in SBP, DBP4, and SBP5 with age and their relationships with indices of adiposity, controlling for energy intake, physical activity, and sexual maturation.\nProject HeartBeat! was a mixed longitudinal study in 678 black and white girls and boys aged 8, 11, or 14 years at first examination, followed at 4-month intervals for up to 4 years (1991-1995). A statistical model was estimated for the trajectory of change in each blood pressure measure from ages 8 to 18 years.\nFor SBP, DBP4, and DBP5, the trajectories were sigmoid, parabolic, and linear in form, respectively. SBP and DBP4 differed significantly by gender; DBP4 and DBP5 were significantly related to race. Adjusted for age, gender, and race, all relationships of adiposity-related variables (percent body fat, abdominal circumference, skinfold thickness, and BMI and its fat and fat-free components) with SBP were positive and significant. Corresponding relationships for DBP4 were notably weaker but significant, and for DBP5, weak or not significant. After adjusting for diet, physical inactivity, and maturation, no DBP5 relationship with adiposity indices remained significant.\nSBP, DBP4, and DBP5 are distinct in patterns of change with age, relationships to gender and race, and patterns of association with multiple anthropometric indices related to adiposity.",

    "abstract": "To look for same-sex (gender assortative) association of body mass index (BMI) in healthy trios (mother, father and child) from a contemporary birth cohort, which might imply shared environment rather than shared genes because selective mother-daughter and father-son gene transmission is not a common Mendelian trait.\nProspective (longitudinal) cohort study with four annual time points, from 5 to 8 years.\n226 healthy trios from a 1995 to 1996 birth cohort randomly selected in the city of Plymouth, UK.\nAverage BMI of the two parents and maternal/paternal BMI separately related to the BMI-SDS (standard deviation score) of all offspring and to the BMI-SDS of the sons and the daughters separately.\nThere were big differences in BMI-SDS among the daughters grouped according to mothers' category of BMI (effect size 1.37 SDS), but not their sons (effect size 0.16 SDS, gender interaction P<0.004), and among the sons grouped according to their fathers' BMI (effect size 1.28 SDS), but not their daughters (effect size 0.17, gender interaction P=0.02). Children whose same-sex parents were of normal weight, weighed either close to (girls+0.20 BMI-SDS) or less than (boys,-0.34 BMI-SDS) children of 20 years ago, and did not change from 5 to 8 years. In contrast, the risks of obesity at 8 years were 10-fold greater (girls 41%, P<0.001) or sixfold greater (boys 18%, P<0.05) if the same-sex parent was obese. Longitudinal linear mixed effects (multilevel) modelling showed a marked influence of maternal and paternal BMI on the rate of weight gain, which was unaffected by birth weight of the child. We report perhaps the largest effect sizes so far recorded in childhood obesity.\nChildhood obesity today seems to be largely confined to those whose same-sex parents are obese, and the link does not seem to be genetic. Parental obesity, like smoking, might be targeted in the interests of the child.",

    "abstract": "The DEAD-box protein DBP5 is essential for mRNA export in both yeast and humans. It binds RNA and is concentrated and locally activated at the cytoplasmic side of the nuclear pore complex. We have determined the crystal structures of human DBP5 bound to RNA and AMPPNP, and bound to the cytoplasmic nucleoporin NUP214. The structures reveal that binding of DBP5 to nucleic acid and to NUP214 is mutually exclusive. Using in vitro assays, we demonstrate that NUP214 decreases both the RNA binding and ATPase activities of DBP5. The interactions are mediated by conserved residues, implying a conserved recognition mechanism. These results suggest a framework for the consecutive steps leading to the release of mRNA at the final stages of nuclear export. More generally, they provide a paradigm for how binding of regulators can specifically inhibit DEAD-box proteins.",

    "abstract": "The exon junction complex (EJC) is deposited onto spliced mRNAs and is involved in many aspects of mRNA function. We have recently reconstituted and solved the crystal structure of the EJC core made of MAGOH, Y14, the most conserved portion of MLN51, and the DEAD-box ATPase eIF4AIII bound to RNA in the presence of an ATP analog. The heterodimer MAGOH/Y14 inhibits ATP turnover by eIF4AIII, thereby trapping the EJC core onto RNA, but the exact mechanism behind this remains unclear. Here, we present the crystal structure of the EJC core bound to ADP-AIF(3), the first structure of a DEAD-box helicase in the transition-mimicking state during ATP hydrolysis. It reveals a dissociative transition state geometry and suggests that the locking of the EJC onto the RNA by MAGOH/Y14 is not caused by preventing ATP hydrolysis. We further show that ATP can be hydrolyzed inside the EJC, demonstrating that MAGOH/Y14 acts by locking the conformation of the EJC, so that the release of inorganic phosphate, ADP, and RNA is prevented. Unifying features of ATP hydrolysis are revealed by comparison of our structure with the EJC-ADPNP structure and other helicases. The reconstitution of a transition state mimicking complex is not limited to the EJC and eIF4AIII as we were also able to reconstitute the complex Dbp5-RNA-ADP-AlF(3), suggesting that the use of ADP-AlF(3) may be a valuable tool for examining DEAD-box ATPases in general.",

    "abstract": "AML1-ETO is generated from t(8;21)(q22;q22), which is a common form of chromosomal translocation associated with development of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Although full-length AML1-ETO alone fails to promote leukemia because of its detrimental effects on cell proliferation, an alternatively spliced isoform, AML1-ETO9a, without its C-terminal NHR3/NHR4 domains, strongly induces leukemia. However, full-length AML1-ETO is a major form of fusion product in many t(8;21) AML patients, suggesting additional molecular mechanisms of t(8;21)-related leukemogenesis. Here, we report that disruption of the zinc-chelating structure in the NHR4 domain of AML1-ETO by replacing only one critical amino acid leads to rapid onset of leukemia, demonstrating that the NHR4 domain with the intact structure generates inhibitory effects on leukemogenesis. Furthermore, we identified SON, a DNA/RNA-binding domain containing protein, as a novel NHR4-interacting protein. Knock-down of SON by siRNA resulted in significant growth arrest, and disruption of the interaction between AML1-ETO and endogenous SON rescued cells from AML1-ETO-induced growth arrest, suggesting that SON is an indispensable factor for cell growth, and AML1-ETO binding to SON may trigger signals inhibiting leukemogenesis. In t(8;21) AML patient-derived primary leukemic cells and cell lines, abnormal cytoplasmic localization of SON was detected, which may keep cells proliferating in the presence of full-length AML1-ETO. These results uncovered the crucial role of the NHR4 domain in determination of cellular fate during AML1-ETO-associated leukemogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Gene expression requires proper messenger RNA (mRNA) export and translation. However, the functional links between these consecutive steps have not been fully defined. Gle1 is an essential, conserved mRNA export factor whose export function is dependent on the small molecule inositol hexakisphosphate (IP(6)). Here, we show that both Gle1 and IP(6) are required for efficient translation termination in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and that Gle1 interacts with termination factors. In addition, Gle1 has a conserved physical association with the initiation factor eIF3, and gle1 mutants display genetic interactions with the eIF3 mutant nip1-1. Strikingly, gle1 mutants have defects in initiation, whereas strains lacking IP(6) do not. We propose that Gle1 functions together with IP(6) and the DEAD-box protein Dbp5 to regulate termination. However, Gle1 also independently mediates initiation. Thus, Gle1 is uniquely positioned to coordinate the mRNA export and translation mechanisms. These results directly impact models for perturbation of Gle1 function in pathophysiology.",

    "abstract": "Coordination of the multiple steps of mRNA biogenesis helps to ensure proper regulation of gene expression. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae DEAD-box protein Rat8p/Dbp5p is an essential mRNA export factor that functions at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) where it is thought to remodel mRNA/protein complexes during mRNA export. Rat8p also functions in translation termination and has been implicated in functioning during early transcription. We conducted a synthetic genetic array analysis (SGA) using a strain harboring the temperature-sensitive rat8-2 allele. Although RAT8 had been shown to interact genetically with >15 other genes, we identified >40 additional genes whose disruption in a rat8-2 background causes synthetic lethality or dramatically reduced growth. Included were five that encode components of P-bodies, sites of cytoplasmic mRNA turnover and storage. Wild-type Rat8p localizes to NPCs and diffusely throughout the cell but rat8-2p localized to cytoplasmic granules at nonpermissive temperature that are distinct from P-bodies. In some genetic backgrounds, these granules also contain poly(A)-binding protein, Pab1p, and additional mRNA export factors. Although these foci are distinct from P-bodies, the two merge under heat-stress conditions. We suggest that these granules reflect defective mRNP remodeling during mRNA export and during cytoplasmic mRNA metabolism.",

    "abstract": "Transduction of developmental and environmental cues into the nucleus to induce transcription and the export of RNAs to the cytoplasm through the nuclear pore complex (NPC) play pivotal roles in regulation of gene expression. The process of bulk export of mRNAs from nucleus to cytoplasm is highly conserved across eukaryotes. Assembly of export-competent mRNA ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) is coupled with both transcription and mRNA processing. The export-competent mRNP consists of mRNAs and a dozen nucleocytoplasmic shuttling nuclear proteins, including RNA export factors (Mex67-Mtr2 heterodimer, Npl3), poly(A)-binding proteins, DEAD-box protein 5 (Dbp5), and nucleoporins (NUPs) in yeast. Mobile NUPs help docking of mRNP to the NPC nuclear basket. A partially unfolded mRNP complex appears to be pulled through the NPC by using energy from Dbp5-catalyzed ATP hydrolysis. Dbp5 probably catalyzes the release of mRNA from mRNP in the cytoplasm. In contrast to bulk export of mRNAs by a Mex67-Mtr2/Npl3-dependent pathway, a specific subset of mRNA export under stress and export of microRNAs are mediated through the karyopherin (importin beta) family of proteins in a Ran-GTPase-dependent pathway. Our knowledge of mRNA export mechanisms in flowering plants is in its infancy. Some proteins of the NUP107-160 complex, NUPs and DEAD-box proteins (DBPs), have been studied in flowering plants. Arabidopsis NUP160/SAR1 plays a critical role in mRNA export, regulation of flowering, and hormone and abiotic stress responses, whereas NUP96/ SAR3/MOS3 is required for mRNA export to modulate hormonal and biotic stress responses. DEAD-box proteins have been implicated in mRNA export and abiotic stress response of yeast and higher plants. Arabidopsis DBP CRYOPHYTE/LOS4 plays an important role in mRNA export, abiotic stress response, germination, and plant development. Further studies on various components of nuclear mRNA export in plants during nonstress and stress conditions will be necessary to understand the link between mRNA export and stress-responsive gene expression.",

Based on son(2205) mutant phenotypes and genetic interactions with Notch and wingless mutations, we conclude that son participates in wing development, and functions in the Notch signaling pathway at the dorsal-ventral boundary in the wing. Notch signaling pathway components activate son enhancer trap expression in wing cells. son enhancer trap expression is regulated positively by wingless, and negatively by cut in boundary cells. Ectopic Son protein induces wingless and cut expression in wing discs. We hypothesize that there is positive feedback regulation of son by wingless, and negative regulation by cut at the dorsal-ventral boundary during wing development.",

    "abstract": "The gene for cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) encodes a noncollagenous matrix protein that is expressed predominantly in cartilage. COMP gene expression is deficient in the Sox9-null mouse, but the molecular mechanism remains unknown. We have previously delineated a 30-bp negative regulatory element (NRE) and a 51-bp positive regulatory element (PRE) in the regulatory region of the COMP gene. Subsequently we isolated LRF transcription repressor as an NRE-binding protein and established that LRF inhibits COMP gene expression via recruiting histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) to the COMP promoter. In this study we demonstrated that Sox9, an essential transcription factor of chondrogenesis, binds to the COMP promoter at the PRE in which 13 nucleotides (TGTTTACCTTGTG) are required for the binding of Sox9. Sox9 activates COMP gene expression and this activation is PRE-dependent. Sox9 is required for COMP gene expression during chondrogenesis, since repression of Sox9 expression using the small interfering RNA approach inhibited COMP gene expression. In addition, activation of COMP gene expression by Sox9 requires the participation of transcription factors Sox5 and Sox6 as well as the coactivators CBP and p300 histone acetylase. It appears that there exists a balance between LRF repressor and Sox9 activator in the control of COMP gene, since transactivation of COMP gene by Sox9 was abolished by the coexpression of LRF, and excess Sox9 overcame the LRF-mediated inhibition. This study provides the first evidence that Sox9 directly associates with COMP gene promoter and that mediation of COMP gene activation by Sox9 involves Sox5, Sox6, CBP, and p300 coactivators.",

    "abstract": "All retroviruses must circumvent cellular restrictions on the export of unspliced RNAs from the nucleus. While the unspliced RNA export pathways for HIV and Mason-Pfizer monkey virus are well characterized, that of Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) is not. We have previously reported that the RSV direct repeat (DR) elements are involved in the cytoplasmic accumulation of unspliced viral RNA. Here, using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), we demonstrate that unspliced viral RNAs bearing a single point mutation (G8863C) in the DR exhibit a restricted cellular localization in and around the nucleus. In contrast, wild type unspliced viral RNA had a diffuse localization throughout the nucleus and cytoplasm. Since the RSV Gag protein has a transient localization in the nucleus, we examined the effect of Gag over-expression on a DR-mediated reporter construct. While Gag did not enhance DR-mediated nuclear export, the dominant-negative expression of two cellular export factors, Tap and Dbp5, inhibited expression of the same reporter construct. Furthermore, FISH studies using the dominant-negative Dbp5 demonstrated that unspliced wild type RSV RNA was retained within the nucleus. Taken together, these results further implicate the DR in nuclear RNA export through interactions with Tap and Dbp5.",

    "abstract": "Export of mature mRNA to the cytoplasm is the culmination of the nuclear portion of eukaryotic gene expression. After transport-competent mature mRNP export complexes are formed in the nucleus, their passage through nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) is facilitated by the Mex67:Mtr2 heterodimer. At the NPC cytoplasmic face, mRNP remodeling prevents its return to the nucleus and so functions as a molecular ratchet imposing directionality on transport. In budding yeast, recent work suggests that the DEAD-box helicase Dbp5 remodels mRNPs at the NPC cytoplasmic face by removing Mex67 and that the Dbp5 ATPase is activated by Gle1 and inositol hexaphosphate (IP(6)).",

    "abstract": "In eukaryotes, termination of messenger RNA (mRNA) translation is mediated by the release factors eRF1 and eRF3. Using Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model organism, we have identified a member of the DEAD-box protein (DBP) family, the DEAD-box RNA helicase and mRNA export factor Dbp5, as a player in translation termination. Dbp5 interacts genetically with both release factors and the polyadenlyate-binding protein Pab1. A physical interaction was specifically detected with eRF1. Moreover, we show that the helicase activity of Dbp5 is required for efficient stop-codon recognition, and intact Dbp5 is essential for recruitment of eRF3 into termination complexes. Therefore, Dbp5 controls the eRF3-eRF1 interaction and thus eRF3-mediated downstream events.",

    "abstract": "The DExD/H-box ATPase Dbp5 is essential for nuclear mRNA export, although its precise role in this process remains poorly understood. Here, we identify the nuclear pore protein Gle1 as a cellular activator of Dbp5. Dbp5 alone is unable to stably bind RNA or effectively hydrolyse ATP under physiological conditions, but addition of Gle1 dramatically stimulates these activities. A gle1 point mutant deficient for Dbp5 stimulation in vitro displays an mRNA export defect in vivo, indicating that activation of Dbp5 is an essential function of Gle1. Interestingly, Gle1 binds directly to inositol hexakisphosphate (InsP6) and InsP6 potentiates the Gle1-mediated stimulation of Dbp5. Dominant mutations in DBP5 and GLE1 that rescue mRNA export phenotypes associated with the lack of InsP6 mimic the InsP6 effects in vitro. Our results define specific functions for Gle1 and InsP6 in mRNA export and suggest that local activation of Dbp5 at the nuclear pore is critical for mRNA export.",

    "abstract": "Regulation of nuclear mRNA export is critical for proper eukaryotic gene expression. A key step in this process is the directional translocation of mRNA-ribonucleoprotein particles (mRNPs) through nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) that are embedded in the nuclear envelope. Our previous studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae defined an in vivo role for inositol hexakisphosphate (InsP6) and NPC-associated Gle1 in mRNA export. Here, we show that Gle1 and InsP6 act together to stimulate the RNA-dependent ATPase activity of the essential DEAD-box protein Dbp5. Overexpression of DBP5 specifically suppressed mRNA export and growth defects of an ipk1 nup42 mutant defective in InsP6 production and Gle1 localization. In vitro kinetic analysis showed that InsP6 significantly increased Dbp5 ATPase activity in a Gle1-dependent manner and lowered the effective RNA concentration for half-maximal ATPase activity. Gle1 alone had minimal effects. Maximal InsP6 binding required both Dbp5 and Gle1. It has been suggested that Dbp5 requires unidentified cofactors. We now propose that Dbp5 activation at NPCs requires Gle1 and InsP6. This would facilitate spatial control of the remodelling of mRNP protein composition during directional transport and provide energy to power transport cycles.",

Mature messenger ribonucleoproteins (mRNPs) diffuse from sites of transcription to NPCs, although some active genes are positioned at the nuclear periphery where they interact physically with components of NPCs. As properly processed mRNPs translocate through the pore, certain mRNP proteins are removed, probably through the enzymatic action of the DEAD-box helicase Dbp5, which binds to Nup159 and Gle1, components of the cytoplasmic filaments of the NPC. Gle1 and the phosphoinositide IP6 activate Dbp5's ATPase activity in vitro and this could provide critical spatial regulation of Dbp5 activity in vivo.",

We have tested the hypothesis that the DEAD-box ATPase Dbp5p is required for such an mRNP rearrangement. In dbp5 mutant cells, the mRNA export receptor Mex67p accumulates on mRNA. This aberrant accumulation of Mex67p with RNA and the cold-sensitive growth phenotype of a dbp5 allele are suppressed by a mex67 mutation. Moreover, Mex67 bound mRNA accumulates at the nuclear rim in a temperature-sensitive dbp5 mutant when the nuclear exosome is impaired. Importantly, although accumulation of Mex67p-containing mRNPs is also observed when a nuclear basket component is mutated, these mRNPs still contain the nuclear export factor Yra1p. In contrast, the dbp5-trapped mRNPs lack Yra1p. We propose that Dbp5p's function is specifically required to displace Mex67p from exported mRNPs, thus terminating export.",

    "abstract": "Despite the fact that the negative regulatory element (NRE) within the upstream regulatory region of human IL-2 receptor alpha (IL-2Ralpha) gene has been identified two decades ago, mechanisms of the NRE function on the gene are hitherto unknown. In this paper, we report for the first time that the immunoglobulin transcription factor 2B (ITF2B) encoded by transcription factor 4 (TCF4) gene is a NRE binding protein. The full-length TCF4 cDNA clone was obtained from a HTLV-1 transformed human peripheral T cell MACHERMAKER cDNA library with NRE as the bait in yeast one-hybrid system. The NRE binding ability of ITF2B was further confirmed in chromatin-immunoprecipitation assay. Competitive RT-PCR-based promoter activity assay showed that over-expression of ITF2B protein inhibited the expression of IL-2Ralpha gene in Jurkat cells in an NRE-dependent manner. The function of ITF2B on the inhibition of both the IL-2Ralpha and the 5'LTR activity of HIV-1 shed light on the essence of NRE binding protein as a potential target for immune therapy and treatment in AIDS patients.",

    "abstract": "Eukaryotic gene expression requires the export of mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. The DEAD box protein Dbp5p is an essential export factor conserved from yeast to man. A fraction of Dbp5p forms a complex with nucleoporins of the cytoplasmic filaments of the nuclear pore complex. Gfd1p was identified originally as a multicopy suppressor of the rat8-2 ts allele of DBP5. Here we reported that Dbp5p and Gfd1p interact with Zds1p, a protein previously identified as a multicopy suppressor in several yeast genetic screens. By using the two-hybrid system, we showed that Zds1p interacts in vivo with both Gfd1p and Dbp5p. In vitro binding experiments revealed that Gfd1p and Dbp5p bind directly to the C-terminal part of Zds1p. In addition, ZDS1 interacted genetically with mutant alleles of genes encoding key factors in mRNA export, including DBP5 and MEX67. Furthermore, deletion of ZDS1 or of both ZDS1 and the closely related ZDS2 exacerbated the poly(A)+ export defects shown by dbp5-2 and mex67-5 mutants. We proposed that Zds1p associates with the complex formed by Dbp5p, Gfd1p, and nucleoporins at the cytosolic fibrils of the nuclear pore complex and is required for optimal mRNA export.",

    "abstract": "Nuclear export of mRNA in eukaryotic cells is mediated by soluble transport factors and components of the nuclear pore complex (NPC). The cytoplasmically oriented nuclear pore protein Nup159 plays a critical role in mRNA export through its conserved N-terminal domain (NTD). Here, we report the crystal structure of the Nup159 NTD, refined to 2.5 A. The structure reveals an unusually asymmetric seven-bladed beta-propeller that is structurally conserved throughout eukarya. Using structure-based conservation analysis, we have targeted specific surface residues for mutagenesis. Residue substitutions in a conserved loop of the NTD abolish in vitro binding to Dbp5, a DEAD box helicase required for mRNA export. In vivo, these mutations cause Dbp5 mislocalization and block mRNA export. These findings suggest that the Nup159 NTD functions in mRNA export as a binding platform, tethering shuttling Dbp5 molecules at the nuclear periphery and locally concentrating this mRNA remodeling factor at the cytoplasmic face of the NPC.",

    "abstract": "The early EICP0 protein is a powerful trans-activator that activates all classes of equine herpesvirus 1 (EHV-1) promoters but, unexpectedly, trans-activates its own promoter very weakly. Transient transfection assays that employed constructs harboring deletions within the EICP0 promoter indicated that EICP0 cis-acting sequences within bp -224 to -158 relative to the first ATG abolished the EICP0 protein's trans-activation of its own promoter. When inserted into the promoters of other EHV-1 genes, this sequence also downregulated activation of the immediate-early IE(-169/+73), early thymidine kinase TK(-215/+97), and late glycoprotein K gK(-83/+14) promoters, indicating that the cis-acting sequence (-224 to -158) downregulated expression of representative promoters of all classes of EHV-1 genes and contains a negative regulatory element (NRE). To define the cis-acting element(s), three synthetic oligonucleotides (Na [bp -224 to -195], Nb [bp -204 to -177], and Nc [bp -185 to -156]) were synthesized and cloned upstream of the EICP0(-157/-21) promoter. Of the three synthetic sequences, only the Nb oligonucleotide caused the downregulation of the EICP0 promoter. The NRE was identified as a 28-bp element to lie at -204 to -177 that encompassed the sequence of ([-204]AGATACAGATGTTCGATAAATTGGAACC[-177]). Gel shift assays performed with mouse L-M, rabbit RK-13, and human HeLa cell nuclear extracts and gamma-(32)P-labeled wild-type and mutant NREs demonstrated that a ubiquitous nuclear protein(s) (NRE-binding protein, NREBP) binds specifically to a sequence (bp -193 to -183) in the NRE. The NREBP is also present in the nucleus of EHV-1-infected cells; however, the amount of NREBP in EHV-1-infected L-M cells that bound to the Nb oligonucleotide was reduced compared to that in uninfected L-M cells. Transient transfection assays showed that deletions or mutations within the NREBP-binding site abolished the NRE activity of the EICP0 promoter. These results suggested that the NREBP may mediate the NRE activity of the EICP0 promoter and may function in the coordinate expression of EHV-1 genes.",

    "abstract": "Production of inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) by Ipk1, the inositol-1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate 2-kinase, is required for Gle1-mediated mRNA export in Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells. To examine the network of interactions that require IP6 production, an analysis of fitness defects was conducted in mutants harboring both an ipk1 null allele and a mutant allele in genes encoding nucleoporins or transport factors. Enhanced lethality was observed with a specific subset of mutants, including nup42, nup116, nup159, dbp5, and gle2, all of which had been previously connected to Gle1 function. Complementation of the nup116Deltaipk1Delta and nup42Deltaipk1Delta double mutants did not require the Phe-Gly repeat domains in the respective nucleoporins, suggesting that IP6 was acting subsequent to heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein targeting to the nuclear pore complex. With Nup42 and Nup159 localized exclusively to the nuclear pore complex cytoplasmic side, we speculated that IP6 may regulate a cytoplasmic step in mRNA export. To test this prediction, the spatial requirements for the production of IP6 were investigated. Restriction of Ipk1 to the cytoplasm did not block IP6 production. Moreover, coincident sequestering of both Ipk1 and Mss4 (an enzyme required for phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate production) to the cytoplasm also did not block IP6 production. Given that the kinase required for inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate production (Ipk2) is localized in the nucleus, these results indicated that soluble inositides were diffusing between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Additionally, the cytoplasmic production of IP6 by plasma membrane-anchored Ipk1 rescued a gle1-2 ipk1-4 synthetic lethal mutant. Thus, cytoplasmic IP6 production is sufficient for mediating the Gle1-mRNA export pathway.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in the human cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) gene have been linked to the development of pseudoachondroplasia and multiple epiphyseal dysplasia. We previously cloned the promoter region of the COMP gene and delineated a minimal negative regulatory element (NRE) that is both necessary and sufficient to repress its promoter (Issack, P. S., Fang, C. H., Leslie, M. P., and Di Cesare, P. E. (2000) J. Orthop. Res. 18, 345-350; Issack, P. S., Liu, C. J., Prazak, L., and Di Cesare, P. E. (2004) J. Orthop. Res. 22, 751-758). In this study, a yeast one-hybrid screen for proteins that associate with the NRE led to the identification of the leukemia/lymphoma-related factor (LRF), a transcriptional repressor that contains a POZ (poxvirus zinc finger) domain, as an NRE-binding protein. LRF bound directly to the NRE both in vitro and in living cells. Nine nucleotides (GAGGGTCCC) in the 30-bp NRE are essential for binding to LRF. LRF showed dose-dependent inhibition of COMP-specific reporter gene activity, and exogenous overexpression of LRF repressed COMP gene expression in both rat chondrosarcoma cells and bone morphogenetic protein-2-treated C3H10T1/2 progenitor cells. In addition, LRF also inhibited bone morphogenetic protein-2-induced chondrogenesis in high density micromass cultures of C3H10T1/2 cells, as evidenced by lack of expression of other chondrocytic markers, such as aggrecan and collagen types II, IX, X, and XI, and by Alcian blue staining. LRF associated with histone deacetylase-1 (HDAC1), and experiments utilizing the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A revealed that LRF-mediated repression requires deacetylase activity. LRF is the first transcription factor found to bind directly to the COMP gene promoter, to recruit HDAC1, and to regulate both COMP gene expression and chondrogenic differentiation.",

Gle1 is also required for mRNA export, and Gle1 interactions with NPC proteins, the RNA helicase Dbp5, and Gfd1 have been reported. Here we report that Nab2, Gfd1, and Gle1 associate in a complex. By using immobilized recombinant Gfd1, Nab2 was isolated from total yeast lysate. A similar biochemical assay with immobilized recombinant Nab2 resulted in coisolation of Gfd1 and Gle1. A Nab2-Gfd1 complex was also identified by coimmunoprecipitation from yeast lysates. In vitro binding assays with recombinant proteins revealed a direct association between Nab2 and Gfd1, and two-hybrid assays delineated Gfd1 binding to the N-terminal Nab2 domain. This N-terminal Nab2 domain is distinct from its RNA binding domains suggesting Nab2 could bind Gfd1 and RNA simultaneously. As Nab2 export was blocked in a gle1 mutant at the restrictive temperature, we propose a model wherein Gfd1 serves as a bridging factor between Gle1 and Nab2-bound mRNA during export.",

    "abstract": "Studies over the past years indicate that there is extensive coupling between nuclear export of mRNA and pre-mRNA processing. Here, we visualized the distribution of exon junction complex (EJC) proteins and RNA export factors relative to sites of abundant pre-mRNA synthesis in the nucleus. We analyzed both HeLa cells infected with adenovirus and murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells stably transfected with the human beta-globin gene. Using in situ hybridization and confocal microscopy, we observe accumulation of EJC proteins (REF/Aly, Y14, SRm160, UAP56, RNPS1, and Magoh) and core spliceosome components (U snRNPs) at sites of transcription. This suggests that EJC proteins bind stably to pre-mRNA cotranscriptionally. No concentration of the export factors NXF1/TAP, p15, and Dbp5 was detected on nascent transcripts, arguing that in mammalian cells these proteins bind the mRNA shortly before or after release from the sites of transcription. These results also suggest that binding of EJC proteins to the mRNA is not sufficient to recruit TAP-p15, consistent with recent findings showing that the EJC does not play a crucial role in mRNA export. Contrasting to the results obtained in MEL cells expressing normal human beta-globin transcripts, mutant pre-mRNAs defective in splicing and 3'end processing do not colocalize with SRm160, REF, UAP56, or Sm proteins. This shows that the accumulation of EJC proteins at transcription sites requires efficient processing of the nascent pre-mRNAs, arguing that transcription per se is not sufficient for the stable assembly of the EJC.",

    "abstract": "The amino acid sequence of gene products is routinely deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the relative cloned cDNA, according to the rules for recognition of start codon (first-AUG rule, optimal sequence context) and the genetic code. From this prediction stem most subsequent types of product analysis, although all standard methods for cDNA cloning are affected by a potential inability to effectively clone the 5' region of mRNA. Revision by bioinformatics and cloning methods of 109 known genes located on human chromosome 21 (HC 21) shows that 60 mRNAs lack any in-frame stop upstream of the first-AUG, and that in five cases (DSCR1, KIAA0184, KIAA0539, SON, and TFF3) the coding region at the 5' end was incompletely characterized in the original descriptions. We describe the respective consequences for genomic annotation, domain and ortholog identification, and functional experiments design. We have also analyzed the sequences of 13,124 human mRNAs (RefSeq databank), discovering that in 6448 cases (49%), an in-frame stop codon is present upstream of the initiation codon, while in the other 6676 mRNAs (51%), identification of additional bases at the mRNA 5' region could well reveal some new upstream in-frame AUG codons in the optimal context. Proportionally to the HC 21 data, about 550 known human genes might thus be affected by this 5' end mRNA artifact.",

    "abstract": "Steroid biosynthesis in ovary is enhanced by the orphan nuclear receptor, steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1); however, we reported that liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1), a closely related receptor to SF-1, is also expressed in mouse ovary. To further investigate the role of LRH-1 in mouse ovary, we used in situ hybridization to identify the cell types that express LRH-1 versus SF-1, and carried out functional studies to determine the role of LRH-1 in the regulation of the human (h) ovary-specific CYP19 promoter. LRH-1 expression was found to be abundant and highly restricted to cells involved in estrogen biosynthesis-granulosa cells during the estrous cycle, and in corpora lutea (CL) of pregnancy. In contrast, SF-1 was expressed most highly in C(19)-steroid-producing theca cells and interstitium, and at low levels in granulosa and luteal cells. Transfection studies using granulosa cells demonstrated that LRH-1 is a potent regulator of both basal and forskolin-induced transcription of the ovary-specific hCYP19 promoter. This activity was dependent upon two nuclear receptor half-sites within the proximal hCYP19 promoter. Based on these findings, we propose that LRH-1 plays an important role as a competence factor in regulating aromatase, and thus estrogen biosynthesis, in ovary.",

    "abstract": "The DHH1 gene in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes a putative RNA helicase of remarkable sequence similarity to several other DExD/H-box proteins, including Xp54 in Xenopus laevis and Ste13p in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. We show here that over-expression of Xp54, an integral component of the stored messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) particles, can rescue the loss of Dhh1p in yeast. Localization and sedimentation studies showed that Dhh1p exists predominantly in the cytoplasm and is present in large complexes whose sizes appear to vary according to the growth stage of the cell culture. In addition, deletion of dhh1, when placed in conjunction with the mutant dbp5 and ded1 alleles, resulted in a synergistically lethal effect, suggesting that Dhh1p may have a role in mRNA export and translation. Finally, similar to Ste13p, Dhh1p is required for sporulation in the budding yeast. Taken together, our data provide evidence that the functions of Dhh1p are conserved through evolution.",

    "abstract": "The yeast DEAD-box protein Dbp5p/Rat8p is an essential factor for mRNA export and shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. It is concentrated at the cytoplasmic fibrils of the nuclear pore complex where it interacts with several nucleoporins. On the basis of this localization, it has been suggested that it might participate in a terminal step of RNA export, the release from the mRNA of proteins that accompany the mRNA during translocation through nuclear pores. In this report, we present evidence linking Dbp5p to transcription. Two different screens identified genetic interactions between DBP5 and genes involved in early transcription events, initiation and promoter clearance. Mutations of transcription proteins expected to impair transcription act as suppressors of dbp5 mutants, whereas those that may act to increase transcription are synthetically lethal with dbp5 mutations. We also show that growth and mRNA export in dbp5 mutant strains are dependent on the carboxy-terminal domain of the RNA pol II largest subunit. Finally, we show that Dbp5p associates physically with components of transcription factor IIH. Because these interactions affect not only growth but also mRNA export, they are likely to reflect a functional relationship between Dbp5p and the transcription machinery. Together, our results suggest a nuclear role for Dbp5 during the early steps of transcription.",

    "abstract": "The DEAD box RNA helicase Dbp5 is essential for nucleocytoplasmic transport of mRNA-protein (mRNP) complexes. Dbp5 is present mainly in the cytoplasm and is enriched at the cytoplasmic side of nuclear pore complexes (NPCs), suggesting that it acts in the late part of mRNP export. Here, we visualize the assembly and transport of a specific mRNP particle, the Balbiani ring mRNP in the dipteran Chironomus tentans, and show that a Dbp5 homologue in C.tentans, Ct-Dbp5, binds to pre-mRNP co-transcriptionally and accompanies the mRNP to and through the nuclear pores and into the cytoplasm. We also demonstrate that Ct-Dbp5 accumulates in the nucleus and partly disappears from the NPC when nuclear export of mRNA is inhibited. The fact that Ct-Dbp5 is present along the exiting mRNP fibril extending from the nuclear pore into the cytoplasm supports the view that Ct-Dbp5 is involved in restructuring the mRNP prior to translation. Finally, the addition of the export factor Dbp5 to the growing transcript highlights the importance of the co-transcriptional loading process in determining the fate of mRNA.",

    "abstract": "The molecular characterization of antigens preferentially or exclusively expressed by astrocytomas and recognized by the autologous immune system are a prerequisite for the development of specific vaccines. To identify such antigens, we screened 5 cDNA expression libraries derived from astrocytomas and other gliomas for reactivity with high-titered IgG antibodies in the sera of astrocytoma patients using SEREX, the serologic identification of antigens by recombinant cDNA expression cloning. Autologous and allogeneic SEREX analysis of >5 x 10(6) clones with the sera of 18 astrocytoma patients revealed 10 antigens: the differentiation antigen glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), Bax-inhibitor 1 (which was overexpressed in all glioma samples tested), 3 other molecules involved in the regulation of gene expression and proliferation (the nm23-H2-encoded nucleoside diphosphate kinase B, the Ran binding protein-2 and a DNA binding protein encoded by the son gene), SP40,40 (a complement inhibitory molecule), the chaperonin TCP-1, calnexin and 2 new gene products. No immune responses were detected against the \"shared tumor\" or \"cancer testis antigens\" that are regularly expressed in gliomas. Antibody responses in astrocytoma patients against antigens expressed by gliomas were rare and, with the exception of Bax-inhibitor 1 and the product of the son gene, were also found in apparently healthy controls. We conclude that although astrocytomas express a broad spectrum of antigens, they elicit antibody responses only rarely, most likely because of their intrinsic immunosuppressive effects.",

    "abstract": "A supernumerary copy of human chromosome 21 (HC21) causes Down syndrome. To understand the molecular pathogenesis of Down syndrome, it is necessary to identify all HC21 genes. The first annotation of the sequence of 21q confirmed 127 genes, and predicted an additional 98 previously unknown \"anonymous\" genes (predictions (PREDs) and open reading frames (C21orfs)), which were foreseen by exon prediction programs and/or spliced expressed sequence tags. These putative gene models still need to be confirmed as bona fide transcripts. Here we report the characterization and expression pattern of the putative transcripts C21orf7, C21orf11, C21orf15, C21orf18, C21orf19, C21orf22, C21orf42, C21orf50, C21orf51, C21orf57, and C21orf58, the GC-rich sequence DNA-binding factor candidate GCFC (also known as C21orf66), PRED12, PRED31, PRED34, PRED44, PRED54, and PRED56. Our analysis showed that most of the C21orfs originally defined by matching spliced expressed sequence tags were correctly predicted, whereas many of the PREDs, defined solely by computer prediction, do not correspond to genuine genes. Four of the six PREDs were incorrectly predicted: PRED44 and C21orf11 are portions of the same transcript, PRED31 is a pseudogene, and PRED54 and PRED56 were wrongly predicted. In contrast, PRED12 (now called C21orf68) and PRED34 (C21orf63) are now confirmed transcripts. We identified three new genes, C21orf67, C21orf69, and C21orf70, not previously predicted by any programs. This revision of the HC21 transcriptome has consequences for the entire genome regarding the quality of previous annotations and the total number of transcripts. It also provides new candidates for genes involved in Down syndrome and other genetic disorders that map to HC21.",

    "abstract": "Dbp5 is the only member of the DExH/D box family of RNA helicases that is directly implicated in the export of messenger RNAs from the nucleus of yeast and vertebrate cells. Dbp5 localizes in the cytoplasm and at the cytoplasmic face of the nuclear pore complex (NPC). In an attempt to identify proteins present in a highly enriched NPC fraction, two other helicases were detected: RNA helicase A (RHA) and UAP56. This suggested a role for these proteins in nuclear transport. Contrary to expectation, we show that the Drosophila homolog of Dbp5 is not essential for mRNA export in cultured Schneider cells. In contrast, depletion of HEL, the Drosophila homolog of UAP56, inhibits growth and results in a robust accumulation of polyadenylated RNAs within the nucleus. Consequently, incorporation of [35S]methionine into newly synthesized proteins is inhibited. This inhibition affects the expression of both heat-shock and non-heat-shock mRNAs, as well as intron-containing and intronless mRNAs. In HeLa nuclear extracts, UAP56 preferentially, but not exclusively, associates with spliced mRNAs carrying the exon junction complex (EJC). We conclude that HEL is essential for the export of bulk mRNA in Drosophila. The association of human UAP56 with spliced mRNAs suggests that this protein might provide a functional link between splicing and export.",

    "abstract": "A negative regulatory element (NRE) is located immediately upstream of the upstream regulatory sequence of core promoter and second enhancer of human hepatitis B virus (HBV). NRE represses the transcription activation function of the upstream regulatory sequence of core promoter and the second enhancer. In this study, we described the cloning and characterization of an NRE-binding protein (NREBP) through expression cloning. NREBP cDNA is 8266 nucleotides in size and encodes a protein of 2386 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 262 kDa. Three previously described cDNAs, DBP-5, SONB, and SONA, are partial sequence and/or alternatively spliced forms of NREBP. The genomic locus of the NREBP/SON gene is composed of 13 exons and 12 introns. The endogenous NREBP protein is localized in the nucleus of human hepatoma HuH-7 cells. Antibody against NREBP protein can specifically block the NRE binding activity present in fractionated nuclear extracts in gel shifting assays, indicating that NREBP is the endogenous nuclear protein that binds to NRE sequence. By polymerase chain reaction-assisted binding site selection assay, we determined that the consensus sequence for NREBP binding is GA(G/T)AN(C/G)(A/G)CC. Overexpression of NREBP enhances the repression of the HBV core promoter activity via NRE. Overexpression of NREBP can also repress the transcription of HBV genes and the production of HBV virions in a transient transfection system that mimics the viral infection in vivo.",

Here we report a biochemical study demonstrating that this activity is the recently cloned p53 analog p63. NBP was purified through conventional and DNA affinity chromatography to apparent homogeneity with a prominent polypeptide migrating in between the 43 and 68 kDa positions on a SDS gel. This polypeptide immunoreacted with monoclonal anti-p63 but not anti-p53 or anti-p73 antibodies. Also, NBP co-purified with p63 through each step of fractionation, as detected with anti-p63 antibodies. DNA-protein complexes formed with purified NBP and p53RE-containing oligomers derived from the p21(waf1) promoter were supershifted by anti-p63 but not anti-p53 antibodies. Thus, these results demonstrate that NBP is encoded by the p53 homolog p63 gene.",

    "abstract": "Our previous studies have focused on a family of Saccharomyces cerevisiae nuclear pore complex (NPC) proteins that contain domains composed of repetitive tetrapeptide glycine-leucine-phenylalanine-glycine (GLFG) motifs. We have previously shown that the GLFG regions of Nup116p and Nup100p directly bind the karyopherin transport factor Kap95p during nuclear protein import. In this report, we have further investigated potential roles for the GLFG region in mRNA export. The subcellular localizations of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged mRNA transport factors were individually examined in yeast cells overexpressing the Nup116-GLFG region. The essential mRNA export factors Mex67-GFP, Mtr2-GFP, and Dbp5-GFP accumulated in the nucleus. In contrast, the localizations of Gle1-GFP and Gle2-GFP remained predominantly associated with the NPC, as in wild type cells. The localization of Kap95p was also not perturbed with GLFG overexpression. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments from yeast cell lysates resulted in the isolation of a Mex67p-Nup116p complex. Soluble binding assays with bacterially expressed recombinant proteins confirmed a direct interaction between Mex67p and the Nup116-GLFG or Nup100-GLFG regions. Mtr2p was not required for in vitro binding of Mex67p to the GLFG region. To map the Nup116-GLFG subregion(s) required for Kap95p and/or Mex67p association, yeast two-hybrid analysis was used. Of the 33 Nup116-GLFG repeats that compose the domain, a central subregion of nine GLFG repeats was sufficient for binding either Kap95p or Mex67p. Interestingly, the first 12 repeats from the full-length region only had a positive interaction with Mex67p, whereas the last 12 were only positive with Kap95p. Thus, the GLFG domain may have the capacity to bind both karyopherins and an mRNA export factor simultaneously. Taken together, our in vivo and in vitro results define an essential role for a direct Mex67p-GLFG interaction during mRNA export.",

    "abstract": "The SON gene, which maps to human chromosome 21q22.1-q22.2, encodes a novel regulatory protein. Here we describe the organization of the Son locus in the mouse genome. The mouse Son gene spans a region of approximately 35 kb. The coding region is more than 8 kb in length and has been completely sequenced. The gene is organized into 11 coding exons and 1 noncoding 3'UTR exon, with over 70% of the coding region residing in one 5.7-kb exon. The gene contains at least one alternative exon, N/C exon 1, which can be used, by splicing, to generate a truncated form of the SON protein. Further investigation of the mouse Son locus has identified the genes directly flanking Son. The glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase gene, Gart, is encoded 5' of Son in a head-to-head arrangement, with the start of both genes lying within 899 bp. Sequence comparison with the expressed sequence tagged database identified a novel gene within 65 bp of the 3' end of Son, which we have named Donson. In this unusually compact gene cluster, we have found overlap in the pattern of expression between Gart, Son, and Donson. However, at least two of these genes have very different functions. While GART is involved in purine biosynthesis, we find that SON shows the characteristics of \"SR- type\" proteins, which are involved in mRNA processing and gene expression.",

    "abstract": "Interleukin-4 (IL-4) regulates the expression of the 55-kDa alpha-subunit (CD25) of the IL-2 receptor complex in human B lymphocytes. This report suggests that the cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) component of the IL-4 receptor signalling programme in human tonsillar B cells has a functionally important role in regulating expression of the CD25 gene by attenuating activity of a protein binding to a potent negative regulatory element (NRE) in the CD25 promoter; this effect can be mimicked by agents that elevate cAMP and blocked by inhibitors of PKA but not protein kinase C (PKC). In a B-cell line that fails to elevate cAMP, attenuate NRE-binding protein (NRE-BP) activity or express CD25 following IL-4 treatment, stimulation of cAMP accumulation by forskolin facilitates IL-4-mediated induction of both the endogenous gene and an exogenous reporter gene under the control of a minimal promoter/enhancer fragment of the CD25 gene.",

    "abstract": "Transcriptional regulation of the interferon-beta (IFN-beta) gene is characterized by strict constitutive repression and virus-specific activation. Previous studies have shown that the IFN-beta promoter is constitutively repressed by a negative regulatory element (NRE). Isolated NRE acts as a constitutive and position-independent silencer on the NF-kappaB-binding sites. Here, we describe the identification and functional characterization of the NRE-binding protein, called NRF (NF-kappaB-repressing factor), which abolishes the transcriptional activity of the bordering NF-kappaB- binding sites by a distance-independent mechanism. Deletion studies show that a minimal repression domain of NRF is sufficient to exert its inhibitory effect. In vitro, NF-kappaB proteins bind to purified NRF by a direct protein-protein interaction. We demonstrate that NRF is a ubiquitous and constitutive nuclear protein. In fibroblasts, the expression of the NRF antisense RNA releases the endogenous IFN-beta gene transcription. Our data strongly suggest that the NRF-mediated inhibition of NF-kappaB is a critical component of the IFN-beta gene silencing prior to viral infection.",

    "abstract": "In a screen for temperature-sensitive mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae defective for mRNA export, we previously identified the essential DEAD-box protein Dbp5p/Rat8p and the nucleoporin Rat7p/Nup159p. Both are essential for mRNA export. Here we report that Dbp5p and Rat7p interact through their Nterminal domains. Deletion of this portion of Rat7p (Rat7pDeltaN) results in strong defects in mRNA export and eliminates association of Dbp5p with nuclear pores. Overexpression of Dbp5p completely suppressed the growth and mRNA export defects of rat7DeltaN cells and resulted in weaker suppression in cells carrying rat7-1 or the rss1-37 allele of GLE1. Dbp5p interacts with Gle1p independently of the N-terminus of Dbp5p. Dbp5p shuttles between nucleus and cytoplasm in an Xpo1p-dependent manner. It accumulates in nuclei of xpo1-1 cells and in cells with mutations affecting Mex67p (mex67-5), Gsp1p (Ran) or Ran effectors. Overexpression of Dbp5p prevents nuclear accumulation of mRNA in xpo1-1 cells, but does not restore growth, suggesting that the RNA export defect of xpo1-1 cells may be indirect. In a screen for high-copy suppressors of the rat8-2 allele of DBP5, we identified YMR255w, now called GFD1. Gfd1p is not essential, interacts with Gle1p and Rip1p/Nup42p, and is found in the cytoplasm and at the nuclear rim.",

    "abstract": "To extend our cDNA project for accumulating basic information on unidentified human genes, we newly determined the sequences of 100 cDNA clones from a set of size-fractionated human adult and fetal brain cDNA libraries, and predicted the coding sequences of the corresponding genes, named KIAA1019 to KIAA1118. The sequencing of these clones revealed that the average size of the inserts and corresponding open reading frames were 5.0 kb and 2.6 kb (880 amino acid residues), respectively. Database search of the predicted amino acid sequences classified 58 predicted gene products into the five functional categories, such as cell signaling/communication, cell structure/motility, nucleic acid management, protein management and cell division. It was also found that, for 34 gene products, homologues were detected in the databases, which were similar in sequence through almost the entire regions. The chromosomal locations of the genes were determined by using human-rodent hybrid panels unless their mapping data were already available in the public databases. The expression profiles of all the genes among 10 human tissues, 8 brain regions (amygdala, corpus callosum, cerebellum, caudate nucleus, hippocampus, substania nigra, subthalamic nucleus, and thalamus), spinal cord, fetal brain and fetal liver were also examined by reverse transcription-coupled polymerase chain reaction, products of which were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.",

    "abstract": "Dbp5 is a DEAD-box protein essential for mRNA export from the nucleus in yeast. Here we report the isolation of a cDNA encoding human Dbp5 (hDbp5) which is 46% identical to yDbp5p. Like its yeast homologue, hDbp5 is localized within the cytoplasm and at the nuclear rim. By immunoelectron microscopy, the nuclear envelope-bound fraction of Dbp5 has been localized to the cytoplasmic fibrils of the nuclear pore complex (NPC). Consistent with this localization, we show that both the human and yeast proteins directly interact with an N-terminal region of the nucleoporins CAN/Nup159p. In a conditional yeast strain in which Nup159p is degraded when shifted to the nonpermissive temperature, yDbp5p dissociates from the NPC and localizes to the cytoplasm. Thus, Dbp5 is recruited to the NPC via a conserved interaction with CAN/Nup159p. To investigate its function, we generated defective hDbp5 mutants and analysed their effects in RNA export by microinjection in Xenopus oocytes. A mutant protein containing a Glu-->Gln change in the conserved DEAD-box inhibited the nuclear exit of mRNAs. Together, our data indicate that Dbp5 is a conserved RNA-dependent ATPase which is recruited to the cytoplasmic fibrils of the NPC where it participates in the export of mRNAs out of the nucleus.",

    "abstract": "Renin is synthesized in high quantities in the juxtaglomerular cells of the kidney, but little or none is synthesized in the liver. Our previous in vitro and biochemical studies have demonstrated that tissue-specific expression of the mouse renin gene is regulated by the specific interaction between negative regulatory element (NRE) in the 5'-flanking region of the renin gene and NRE binding protein (NREB). In this study, we examined the hypothesis that this interaction between the NRE in the promoter region of the rat renin gene and the NREB in the liver contributes to the suppressed renin gene expression in this tissue in vivo. We used in vivo transfection of NRE transcription factor decoy (TFD) double-stranded oligonucleotide into the rat liver via portal vein infusion. A gel mobility shift assay showed that transfected NRE TFD blocked endogenous NREB binding with the rat renin gene. This resulted in enhanced hepatic renin mRNA expression, immunohistochemical detection of renin in the liver, and consequently, increased plasma renin concentration. Taken together, these results document the importance of NREB in the inhibition of renin gene expression in rat liver in vivo and suggest the possibility of in vivo renin gene modulation by the TFD approach.",

    "abstract": "We show that during Caenorhabditis elegans male spicule development, the specification of a glial versus neuronal cell fate in a canonical neurogenic sublineage is dependent on Wnt signaling. Inactivation of a Wnt signaling pathway mediated by the Wnt receptor LIN-17 transforms the SPD sheath cell into its sister, the SPD neuron. We discovered a new mutant, son-1, that displays this same cell fate transformation. The son-1 mutation enhances the phenotypes of reduction-of-function lin-17 mutants in several developmental processes, including vulva development, somatic gonad development, and male tail patterning. son-1 encodes an HMG1/2-like DNA-binding protein and is localized in all cell nuclei through development as revealed by a GFP reporter construct. Disruption of son-1 function by RNA-mediated interference results in the same spicule defect as caused by overexpression of POP-1, a TCF/LEF class HMG protein known to act downstream of the Wnt signaling pathway. Our results provide in vivo evidence for the functional involvement of an HMG1/2-like protein, SON-1, in Wnt signaling. The sequence nonspecific HMG protein SON-1 and the sequence specific HMG protein POP-1 might both act in the Wnt responding cells to regulate gene transcription in opposite directions.",

They are compared with published data from the RICARDIN study, that includes 10,042 participants selected at the schools in nine centers of Spain (one was the center in Galicia).\nStandardized methodology and certification procedures were used in Galicia and Spain to measure weight, height, Qu\u00e9telet index, systolic (SBP) and fifth-phase diastolic blood pressure (DBP5) and sexual maturation. Data are presented by sex and age group (1 year) both in Galicia and Spain.\nFrom 11 years and above, girls in Galicia present higher SBP than in Spain. In boys, the difference appears later. Galicia shows higher DBP5 levels than Spain in every age-sex group. In relation to obesity, the differences are of a small magnitude in the Qu\u00e9telet index, again, higher values in Galicia.\nThis is the first population-based study available that rules out the possibility that the observed differences, previously already suggested, could be attributed to methodological problems. The differences in blood pressure and obesity between Galicia and other areas of Spain, already previously suggested in adults, can be the reflection of differences present from childhood.",

    "abstract": "To identify Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes important for nucleocytoplasmic export of messenger RNA, we screened mutant strains to identify those in which poly(A)+ RNA accumulated in nuclei under nonpermissive conditions. We describe the identification of DBP5 as the gene defective in the strain carrying the rat8-1 allele (RAT = ribonucleic acid trafficking). Dbp5p/Rat8p, a previously uncharacterized member of the DEAD-box family of proteins, is closely related to eukaryotic initiation factor 4A(eIF4A) an RNA helicase essential for protein synthesis initiation. Analysis of protein databases suggests most eukaryotic genomes encode a DEAD-box protein that is probably a homolog of yeast Dbp5p/Rat8p. Temperature-sensitive alleles of DBP5/RAT8 were prepared. In rat8 mutant strains, cells displayed rapid, synchronous accumulation of poly(A)+ RNA in nuclei when shifted to the non-permissive temperature. Dbp5p/Rat8p is located within the cytoplasm and concentrated in the perinuclear region. Analysis of the distribution of Dbp5p/Rat8p in yeast strains where nuclear pore complexes are tightly clustered indicated that a fraction of this protein associates with nuclear pore complexes (NPCs). The strong mutant phenotype, association of the protein with NPCs and genetic interaction with factors involved in RNA export provide strong evidence that Dbp5p/Rat8p plays a direct role in RNA export.",

It is shown here that Dbp5p is an ATP-dependent RNA helicase required for polyadenylated [poly(A)+] RNA export. Surprisingly, Dbp5p is present predominantly, if not exclusively, in the cytoplasm, and is highly enriched around the nuclear envelope. This observation raises the possibility that Dbp5p may play a role in unloading or remodeling messenger RNA particles (mRNPs) upon arrival in the cytoplasm and in coupling mRNP export and translation. The functions of Dbp5p are likely to be conserved, since its potential homologues can be found in a variety of eukaryotic cells.",

    "abstract": "DEAD-box RNA helicases, defined by the sequence Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp (DEAD, in single-letter amino-acid code), regulate RNA unwinding and secondary structure in an ATP-dependent manner in vitro [1] and control mRNA stability and protein translation. Both yeast and mammals have large families of DEAD-box proteins, many of unknown function. We have disrupted a Dictyostelium discoideum gene, helC, which encodes helicase C, a member of the DEAD-box family of RNA helicases that shows strong homology to the product of the essential Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene dbp5 [2] and to related helicases in mouse and Schizosaccharomyces pombe. The HelC protein also shows weaker homology to the translation initiation factor elF-4a. Other DEAD-box-containing proteins, which are less closely related to HelC, have been implicated in developmental roles in Drosophila [3] and Xenopus laevis; one example is the Xenopus Vasa-like protein (XVLP) [4-6]. In Drosophila and Xenopus, Vasa and XVLP, respectively, are required for the establishment of tissue polarity during development. In yeast, DEAD-box helicases such as Prp8 [7] are components of the spliceosome and connect pre-mRNA splicing with the cell cycle. Disruption of the helC gene in D. discoideum led to developmental asynchrony, failure to differentiate and aberrant morphogenesis. We postulate that one reason for the existence of large families of homologous DEAD-box proteins in yeast, mammals and Dictyostelium could be that some DEAD-box proteins have developmentally specific roles regulating protein translation or mRNA stability.",

    "abstract": "Mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) causes mammary carcinomas and T-cell tumors in mice. MMTV variants that induce T-cell tumors have a large deletion within the U3 region of the long terminal repeat (LTR) compared to MMTV strains that induce mammary tumors. We provide evidence here that T-cell tropic MMTV strains lack a redundant binding site for a cellular protein called NBP (negative regulatory element binding protein). The lack of NBP-binding sites in T-cell tropic MMTV strains presumably leads to higher levels of transcription in T-cells during the MMTV life cycle and an increased incidence of mutagenic integration events.",

    "abstract": "The tissue specificity of mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) expression is controlled by regulatory elements in the MMTV long terminal repeat (LTR). These regulatory elements include the hormone response element, located approximately between -200 and -75, as well as binding sites for NF-1, Oct-1 (OTF-1), and mammary gland enhancer factors. Naturally occurring MMTV deletion variants isolated from T-cell and kidney tumors, transgenic-mouse experiments with MMTV LTR deletions, and transient transfection assays with LTR constructs indicate that there are additional transcription regulatory elements, including a negative regulatory element (NRE), located upstream of the hormone response element. To further define this regulatory region, we have constructed a series of BAL 31 deletion mutants in the MMTV LTR for use in transient transfection assays. These assays indicated that deletion of two regions (referred to as promoter-distal and -proximal NREs) between -637 and -201 elevated basal MMTV promoter activity in the absence of glucocorticoids. The region between -637 and -264 was surveyed for the presence of nuclear protein binding sites by gel retardation assays. Only one type of protein complex (referred to as NRE-binding protein or NBP) bound exclusively to sites that mapped to the promoter-distal and -proximal NREs identified by BAL 31 mutations. The promoter-proximal binding site was mapped further by linker substitution mutations and transfection assays. Mutations that mapped to a region containing an inverted repeat beginning at -287 relative to the start of transcription elevated basal expression of a reporter gene driven by the MMTV LTR. A 59-bp DNA fragment from the distal NRE also bound the NBP complex. Gel retardation assays showed that mutations within both inverted repeats of the proximal NRE eliminated NBP binding and mutations within single repeats altered NBP binding. Intriguingly, the NBP complex was detected in extracts from T cells and lung cells but was absent from mammary gland cells. These results suggest that a factor contributing to high-level expression of MMTV in the mammary gland is the lack of negative regulation by NBP.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we show that the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can be used on regions of highly conserved genes, such as the 3' untranslated region (3' UTR) of the SON gene, to identify the mammalian origin of a sample. Using this test, we have been able to distinguish human, monkey, cat, dog, mouse and hamster DNAs. We have also determined the DNA sequence of these different PCR products, which can be used to reinforce species identification. The advantages of this test are that: (i) no prior information is required on the possible species origin of a sample, (ii) the reaction produces a single PCR product which varies in size according to the species of origin, making the test simple to interpret, and (iii) the target region of DNA amplified in these experiments is small and can easily be sequenced and sized using automated techniques. This small size has enabled us to successfully amplify this product from DNA extracted from compromised material (human bone samples) and so demonstrate that the test is valuable for the characterisation of remains in which DNA is degraded.",

    "abstract": "The mouse renin locus (Ren-1d) exhibits specific patterns of tissue expression. It is expressed in kidney but not submandibular gland (SMG). This locus contains a negative regulatory element (NRE) and a cAMP responsive element (CRE) that share an overlapping sequence. In the kidney, CRE binding proteins (CREB) and NRE binding proteins (NREB) compete for binding to this sequence, with the CREB having a greater affinity. In the SMG, CREB is inactivated by an inhibitory protein, permitting NREB to bind to the sequence, thus inhibiting Ren-1d expression. We hypothesize that the competition between NREB and CREB for this sequence governs tissue-specific expression of mouse renin. We speculate that this may be a general paradigm that determines tissue-specific gene expression.",

    "abstract": "Recently we have published a sequence of the coding region of the son gene, containing at least six areas of the tandem repeats [V.V. Bliskovsky, F.B. Berdichevsky, A.V.

P. 807-812]. The presence of several areas of tandem repeats with different nucleotide sequences of the repeated elements within one and the same gene supports the proposition that genomic localization of the sequence influences its duplication. Here we present a nucleotide sequence of the son pseudogene isolated as the result of hybridization screening of a human genomic library using the sequence of the son gene as a probe. The comparison of the gene and the pseudogene nucleotide sequences shows that the sequence of pseudogene does not contain five repeated units of an area of the tandem repeats, which are presented in the homology sequence of the son gene. Because the pseudogene was probably generated by the reverse son-gene transcript insertion to the genome, and so the nucleotide sequences of the coding region of the gene and the sequence of the pseudogene were identical at this moment, the differences between the gene and the pseudogene are the results of their evolution after the generation of the pseudogene. Possible factors, influenced the son gene and the son pseudogene evolution are discussed.",

    "abstract": "In an effort to identify trans-acting factors regulating specific genes, we cloned a novel human gene, DBP-5. The cDNA clone contains a predicted open reading frame coding for a potential 1,179 amino acid protein. The mRNA corresponding to DBP-5 is ubiquitously distributed, and the gene is phylogenetically conserved. Immunofluorescence analyses with several cell lines indicate that the protein is localized to the nucleus. Sequence analysis revealed unusual features of the predicted protein structure, including four completely conserved repeats. The phylogenetic conservation of DBP-5, the ubiquity of its expression, its nuclear localization, and its ability to bind DNA sequences, raise the possibility that DBP-5 may play a role in the organization of interphase chromatin and/or in transcriptional regulation.",

With higher CW:AC ratios the level is underestimated. National recommendations for adults state that the CW:AC ratio is optimal at approximately 40%, but no consistent recommendations exist for children.\nWe measured SBP and diastolic blood pressure phases 4 and 5 in 811 boys and 771 girls aged 10-17 years (93% participation rate). In each subject the blood pressure was measured with a cuff conforming to the 40% rule (recommended cuff), with one smaller (mean decrease in the CW:AC ratio:7.4%), and with one larger (mean increase in the CW:AC ratio:10.2%). Cuffs were used in random order.\nSmaller cuffs gave significantly higher blood pressure readings. With the larger cuff there were significant mean decreases. The differences were independent of the blood pressure level obtained with the recommended cuff. The impact upon the estimate of the prevalence of high blood pressure was substantial.\nSelection of the proper cuff size is important for children and adolescents, in order to avoid both over- and underdiagnosis of hypertension.",

After several cycles of human placenta library walking we were able to identify and clone two alternative transcripts of this gene. Recently we have determined nucleotide sequence of small son gene transcript, coding region of which contains four areas of complete tandem repeats. Here we report the structure of the part (2.9 kb) of large transcript of son gene from close to its 5'-end to the end of sequence, unique for this transcript. Comparison of nucleotide sequences of two transcripts indicates that they have common 3'-ends and, probably, arise from alternative splicing. 5' proximal part of large transcript contains two areas of complete tandem repeats not present in small transcript. Results of analysis of this area support our model for forming son gene tandem repeats structure by duplication, mutation and natural selection at the protein level.",

    "abstract": "This study determined age-specific patterns of blood pressure (BP) in Spanish children aged 1-18 years for the purpose of developing BP guidelines for this population. Age- and sex-specific BP levels were constructed by pooling data from 15 studies conducted in Spain. Pooled mean BP levels were then compared with those reported by the US Second Task Force on Blood Pressure Control in Children and those recently reported from a separate pooled analysis of the relevant published surveys collected worldwide. In the Spanish data, the average 1-year age increment in Systolic BP (SBP) was uniform for boys and girls until 13 years at 2 mmHg; for boys aged 13-18 the increase was 1.3 mmHg/year; in contrast, girls reached their maximum values at age 13 and the means remained basically unchanged for female adolescents. Fifth-phase diastolic BP (DBP5) values showed a uniform increase for both boys and girls from ages 6 to 18 years at 0.9 mmHg/year. In most age-sex subgroups, mean SBP values were higher (7-8 mmHg on average) in Spain than in the US. However, Spanish values for SBP were in general only slightly higher or approximately equal to those for the international data, from ages 6 to 18 years. The patterns of change in SBP with age differed somewhat in the three data sets. Comparisons for DBP were limited to the age groups for which readings of DBP5 were available. For DBP5, only slight differences between the Spanish and International pools were observed (ages 6-18 compared), but these values were notably higher than those from the US (ages 13-18 compared). These findings suggest that the use of any particular age-based standard to evaluate readings in children in diverse populations cannot be recommended, at least until there is a better understanding of the true differences in BP between populations.",

With this antiserum the presence of son-protein was showed in lysates of cultured human cells transformed by adenovirus type 5, RAT 2 cells and primary human embryonic fibroblasts. son-Protein molecular weight (92 kDa) was determined by the method of electrophoresis in SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Thus, it was shown the presence of son gene protein in animal and human cells. To determine a possible son gene role in mammalian cells we have cloned the 3' part (2667 b.p.) of son cDNA in retroviral vector pPS-3-neo. Transformed cells of different lines were selected.

    "abstract": "The pre-adult patterns of change in blood pressure with age have been investigated by review and pooled analysis of the relevant worldwide literature. The results indicate, foremost, the almost universal overall upward progression of blood pressure levels between ages 6 and 18 years, separately for systolic, fourth-phase and fifth-phase diastolic pressures (SBP, DBP4, DBP5). This report summarizes results of an extensive literature search based on 129 qualifying publications, in many languages, of which 79 yielded data adequate for a pooled age-sex-specific analysis for boys and girls aged 6-18 years. More than 200,000 observations were available for SBP and nearly 100,000 each for DBP4 and DBP5, respectively. In this overall pool, SBP increased uniformly for boys from age 6-12 and for girls from 6-9, at 1.4 mm Hg/yr; for boys the slope increased abruptly to 3.2 mm Hg/yr from 12-15 and fell to 0 at age 18; for girls the maximum increase was only 2.1 mm Hg/yr, from 9-13, and it reversed at age 16, reaching -3.4 mm Hg/yr from 17-18. Thus for SBP the absolute values for boys and girls were identical up to age nine and nearly so to age 14 and then separated, with values for girls increasing only slightly to age 16 and actually decreasing to age 18. A similar separation of age-specific values by sex occurred with DBP4, but not until age 16, after which DBP4 decreased for girls.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "The authors compared the properties of nonreceptor estrogen-binding protein (NREBP) of the ovaries of immature rats, specific estrogen-binding protein (SEBP) of the liver and alpha-fetoprotein (alpha-FP) of the rat blood serum. It was shown that all 3 proteins with moderate affinity bound 3H-estradiol (Ka approximately 10(8)M-1) and were characterized by a high rate of interaction with ligand (K+1 approximately 10(6)M-1c-1) and dissociation of hormone-protein complexes (K-1 approximately 10(-2)c-1). NREBP and alpha-FP manifested a very close hormonal specificity of affinity differing from SEBP specificity: both proteins bound intensively estrone and estradiol, to a lesser degree, estriol, and did not bind androgens and hexestrol. Stokes' radii of the molecules of 3 proteins were 4.4 and 2.5 nm, respectively. Rabbit antiserum to alpha-FP suppressed the hormone-binding activity of blood alpha-FP and ovarian NREBP but not liver SEBP. With growth of animals a study of the time course of the levels of ovarian NREBP and blood alpha-FP has shown that the presence of NREBP in the ovarian cytosol does not probably result from blood proteins mechanical contamination of the sample in homogenization. It has been assumed that intracellular alpha-FP or its close analog may be involved in the regulation of ovarian endocrine function, reversibly binding estrogens.",

    "abstract": "It has been postulated that increased dietary sodium associated with greater food intake by obese people is a mechanism for the relationship between obesity and blood pressure (BP). We have evaluated this hypothesis by exploring the interrelationships of measures of obesity, sodium intake, and BP in 248 \"normal\" adolescents, 16 to 17 years of age. As an index of sodium intake, the sodium excretion in three overnight urine collections was used. As a more specific index of saltiness of diet, we used a ratio of sodium excretion to calorie intake, with calories estimated from 3-day diet records and dietary interview. Body weight and other measures of obesity showed a positive relationship with systolic blood pressure (SBP), but not with diastolic (K5) blood pressure (DBP5). Measures of overnight sodium excretion were positively correlated with body weight and calculated body fat percentage, suggesting that heavier people indeed ingest more sodium. This may result not from increased intake of food per se, but from increased saltiness of diet, since calorie intake did not increase with body weight. No significant relationships were found between BP and concurrent measures of sodium excretion or diet saltiness.",
