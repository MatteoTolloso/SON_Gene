TI  - ZTTK syndrome: Clinical and molecular findings of 15 cases and a review of the 
      literature.
PG  - 3740-3753
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.a.62445 [doi]
AB  - Zhu-Tokita-Takenouchi-Kim (ZTTK) syndrome is caused by de novo loss-of-function 
      variants in the SON gene (MIM #617140). This multisystemic disorder is characterized 
      by intellectual disability, seizures, abnormal brain imaging, variable dysmorphic 
      features, and various congenital anomalies. The wide application and increasing 
      accessibility of whole exome sequencing (WES) has helped to identify new cases of 
      ZTTK syndrome over the last few years. To date, there have been approximately 45 
      cases reported in the literature. Here, we describe 15 additional individuals with 
      variants in the SON gene, including those with missense variants bringing the total 
      number of known cases to 60. We have reviewed the clinical and molecular data of 
      these new cases and all previously reported cases to further delineate the most 
      common as well as emerging clinical findings related to this syndrome. Furthermore, 
      we aim to delineate any genotype-phenotype correlations specifically for a recurring 
      pathogenic four base pair deletion (c.5753_5756del) along with discussing the impact 
      of missense variants seen in the SON gene.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The present study aims to summarize the clinical and genetic 
      characteristics of ZTTK syndrome. METHODS: The clinical and genetic data of a 
      Chinese girl with severe growth and development delay, intellectual disability, and 
      facial features were analyzed. Original articles on ZTTK syndrome published up to 
      November 20l8 were identified from PubMed, Human Gene Mutation Database, Online 
      Mendelian Inheritance in Man, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and WanFang 
      databases using the keywords "ZTTK syndrome" and "SON". RESULTS: The patient was 
      born small for gestational age, and had poor academic performance, delayed language 
      development, and motor retardation. The patient's height was 113 cm (less than -3 
      SD), and had moles on the back skin and possessed facial features. A novel 
      heterozygous mutation c.394C>T (p.Q132X) of SON was found in this patient, but the 
      parents were normal. CONCLUSION: The patient's clinical phenotype was consistent 
      with ZTTK syndrome. The novel heterozygous mutation c.394C>T (p.Q132X) of SON was 
      its pathogenic mutation, which has not been reported at home and abroad.

TI  - Establishing the phenotypic spectrum of ZTTK syndrome by analysis of 52 individuals 
      with variants in SON.
LID - 10.1038/s41431-021-00960-4 [doi]
AB  - Zhu-Tokita-Takenouchi-Kim (ZTTK) syndrome, an intellectual disability syndrome first 
      described in 2016, is caused by heterozygous loss-of-function variants in SON. Its 
      encoded protein promotes pre-mRNA splicing of many genes essential for development. 
      Whereas individual phenotypic traits have previously been linked to erroneous 
      splicing of SON target genes, the phenotypic spectrum and the pathogenicity of 
      missense variants have not been further evaluated. We present the phenotypic 
      abnormalities in 52 individuals, including 17 individuals who have not been reported 
      before. In total, loss-of-function variants were detected in 49 individuals (de novo 
      in 47, inheritance unknown in 2), and in 3, a missense variant was observed (2 de 
      novo, 1 inheritance unknown). Phenotypic abnormalities, systematically collected and 
      analyzed in Human Phenotype Ontology, were found in all organ systems. Significant 
      inter-individual phenotypic variability was observed, even in individuals with the 
      same recurrent variant (n = 13). SON haploinsufficiency was previously shown to lead 
      to downregulation of downstream genes, contributing to specific phenotypic features. 
      Similar functional analysis for one missense variant, however, suggests a different 
      mechanism than for heterozygous loss-of-function. Although small in numbers and 
      while pathogenicity of these variants is not certain, these data allow for 
      speculation whether de novo missense variants cause ZTTK syndrome via another 
      mechanism, or a separate overlapping syndrome. In conclusion, heterozygous 
      loss-of-function variants in SON define a recognizable syndrome, ZTTK, associated 
      with a broad, severe phenotypic spectrum, characterized by a large inter-individual 
      variability. These observations provide essential information for affected 
      individuals, parents, and healthcare professionals to ensure appropriate clinical 
      management.

AB  - Zhu-Tokita-Takenouchi-Kim (ZTTK) syndrome, a rare congenital anomaly syndrome 
      characterized by intellectual disability, brain malformation, facial dysmorphism, 
      musculoskeletal abnormalities, and some visceral malformations is caused by de novo 
      heterozygous mutations of the SON gene. The nuclear protein SON is involved in gene 
      transcription and RNA splicing; however, the roles of SON in neural development 
      remain undetermined. We investigated the effects of Son knockdown on neural 
      development in mice and found that Son knockdown in neural progenitors resulted in 
      defective migration during corticogenesis and reduced spine density on mature 
      cortical neurons. The induction of human wild-type SON expression rescued these 
      neural abnormalities, confirming that the abnormalities were caused by SON 
      insufficiency. We also applied truncated SON proteins encoded by disease-associated 
      mutant SON genes for rescue experiments and found that a truncated SON protein 
      encoded by the most prevalent SON mutant found in ZTTK syndrome rescued the neural 
      abnormalities while another much shorter mutant SON protein did not. These data 
      indicate that SON insufficiency causes neuronal migration defects and dendritic 
      spine abnormalities, which seem neuropathological bases of the neural symptoms of 
      ZTTK syndrome. In addition, the results support that the neural abnormalities in 
      ZTTK syndrome are caused by SON haploinsufficiency independent of the types of 
      mutation that results in functional or dysfunctional proteins.

AB  - Zhu-Tokita-Takenouchi-Kim (ZTTK) syndrome is a rare, severe, and recently described 
      multisystem developmental disorder characterized by delayed psychomotor development 
      and intellectual disability, characteristic facial features, hypotonia, poor overall 
      growth, and visual abnormalities. Mucocutaneous manifestations have not been 
      reported so far among individuals with ZTTK syndrome. Herein, we present a patient 
      with ZTTK syndrome due to a de novo mutation in SON gene, who has dental 
      abnormalities and retronychia of the toenails. We suggest that mucocutaneous 
      features may be a part of the phenotype.

      variants in the SON gene.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The genetic etiology of intellectual and psychomotor disability without 
      a defined spectrum of dysmorphic features is usually monogenic. As no diagnostic 
      criteria for such diseases are established, the clinical diagnosis becomes to be a 
      challenge. The object of our paper is to present two patients with non-specific 
      clinical symptoms for whom whole-exome-sequencing identified the new SON mutations 
      and thus allowed for establishing the diagnosis of Zhu-Tokita-Takenouchi-Kim (ZTTK) 
      syndrome. In both patients, the same symptoms including hypotonia, developmental and 
      speech delay, feeding difficulties as well as frequent infections of the respiratory 
      tract and internal ear were observed. However, both cases presented also with 
      exceptional symptoms such as in case 1 ventriculomegaly and asymmetry of ventricles, 
      hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS), intellectual disability, intestinal 
      malrotation, gastroparesis, and duodenal atresia and in the case 2 febrile seizures 
      and reduced IgA levels. We will be presenting the patients and comparing them to 30 
      previously described cases. METHODS: Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed on 
      the probands' DNA and paired-end sequenced (2x100 bp) on HiSeq 1500. Variants 
      considered as disease-causing were validated in the proband and studied in all 
      available family members by amplicon deep sequencing performed using Nextera XT Kit 
      and sequenced on HiSeq 1500. RESULTS: We have identified two new variants in SON 
      gene. In case 1 it has been a heterozygous frameshift variant p.(Ala1340GlnfsTer26), 
      while in case 2 it has been a heterozygous frameshift variant, p.(Asp1640GlyfsTer7). 
      Both variants are described for the first time and up to now, are not mentioned in 
      any database. CONCLUSION: As there are no precise criteria established for the 
      clinical diagnosis of ZTTK, an identification of SON gene mutation by 
      whole-exome-sequencing is the best method that allows for a diagnosis of this 
      syndrome.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Zhu-Tokita-Takenouchi-Kim (ZTTK, OMIM# 617140) syndrome is a rare, 
      autosomal dominant genetic disorder caused by heterozygous variants in the SON gene 
      (OMIM#182465, GenBank#NC_000021.9). There are only 33 cases and 26 causative SON 
      variants reported to date since the first report in 2015. Here, we report a new case 
      of ZTTK syndrome and a de novo disease-causing SON variant. METHODS: We conducted 
      whole-exome sequencing (WES) to obtain genetic data of the patient. The clinical and 
      genetic data of the patient were analyzed. RESULTS: The clinical features of our 
      patient were strikingly similar to previously reported cases. Notably, our patient 
      had unique presentations, including a bridged palmar crease in the left hand and 
      growth hormone deficiency. The c.5297del de novo variant in SON causes an amino 
      change (p.Ser1766Leufs*7). CONCLUSION: Our report expands the mutant spectrum of the 
      SON gene and refines the genotype-phenotype map of ZTTK syndrome. Our findings also 
      highlighted the importance of WES for early diagnosis of ZTTK syndrome, which may 
      improve diagnostic procedures for affected individuals.

TI  - A novel de novo frameshift variation in the SON gene causing severe global 
      developmental delay and seizures in a Chinese female.
LID - 10.1002/jdn.10170 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: With the rapid development of genetic detection technology, especially 
      next-generation sequencing, identification of the aetiology of unexplained 
      intellectual disabilities accompanied by seizures and other dysmorphic features has 
      become possible. The purpose of our paper is to make a definitive diagnosis of a 
      girl with neonatal hypotonia, severe global developmental delay, seizures and mild 
      facial dysmorphism. METHODS: The clinical data of the patient were retrospectively 
      studied. Whole-exome sequencing was performed on a blood sample from the patient. 
      Subsequently, Sanger sequencing was utilized for validation of variants and parental 
      validation. RESULTS: The patient had hypotonia since the neonatal period. She showed 
      a significant delay in physical and psychomotor development. She did not have any 
      speech until the age of 2 years and 6 months. She had seizures that were easy to 
      control with levetiracetam. The craniocerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) then 
      showed mild delayed myelination, enlarged bilateral ventricles and widened 
      frontotemporal extracerebral space. Interictal video electroencephalogram (VEEG) was 
      normal. She had esotropia and mild facial abnormalities with a flat nasal bridge and 
      a short nose. She showed no abnormalities in the heart, genitourinary or skeletal 
      systems. Whole-exome sequencing revealed a novel de novo variant c.5334_5335delAG 
      (p. Arg1778Serfs*11) in the SON gene. CONCLUSION: Our paper reports a novel variant 
      in the SON gene and provides a definitive diagnosis of a female with neonatal 
      hypotonia, severe global developmental delay, seizures and mild facial 
      abnormalities, which are symptoms consistent with Zhu-Tokita-Takenouchi-Kim syndrome 
      (ZTTK syndrome).
